<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RENTAL WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR BREAKAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The custom of ship-drivers is to pay the rental when they move the ship, and to pay the loss when it breaks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the law depend in the custom? (If he will pay when it breaks, it is as if he buys it, but he pays rental now because he will pay only later!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa justifies the custom. (Since he is liable only for death (regarding a ship, breakage, total loss but not depreciation), he may also pay rent.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MONEY OF ORPHANS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Anan citing Shmuel):</span> We may lend orphans' money on Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> We may not cause them to transgress. They will be punished for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What was the case (from which you inferred this)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Anan:</span> Shmuel had a cauldron of Mar Ukva's orphans. He rented it to others and also charged them if it decreased in weight.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To pay both is Ribis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman):</span> One may pay both even to adults. They pay for the loss of weight, and also rental because the remaining metal depreciates through usage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Shila):</span> One may invest orphans' money on condition that they can profit but cannot lose. (This is Avak Ribis, which is normally forbidden mid'Rabanan. Regarding orphans, Chachamim permit it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one invests money on condition that he can profit but cannot lose, he is evil. If he can lose but cannot profit, he is a Chasid. If he can profit or lose, or can neither profit nor lose, this like most people do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rabah (to Rav Yosef):</span> What do we do with orphans' money?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> We leave it in Beis Din and give them each Zuz when they need it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> The principal will dissipate!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> What do you suggest?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> We find a man who owns pieces of gold. We buy pieces of gold with their money, and invest it with him, on condition that they can gain but cannot lose.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot use a man who owns only identifiable things. Perhaps they are a deposit. The owner will give a Siman and retrieve his deposit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> If we do not find such a man, will we allow the orphans to consume the principal?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Rather, we find a man whose property is uncontested. He must be trustworthy, knowledgeable of Torah law and acquiescent to Beis Din. We invest the money with him in Beis Din, on condition that they can gain but cannot lose.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TZON BARZEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not accept Tzon Barzel from a Yisrael; since it is Ribis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We may accept from a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We may borrow from or lend to a Nochri or Ger Toshav (a Nochri who accepted to guard his seven Mitzvos) on Ribis;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We may lend a Nochri's money according to his will, but not according to the Yisrael's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> (Since this is called Ribis,) we may infer that Tzon Barzel belongs to the receiver (he suffers any losses (Rashi - and the profits are shared; Tosfos - the investor is guaranteed a fixed revenue)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If one accepts Tzon Barzel from a Nochri, the offspring are exempt from Bechorah (the firstborn has no Kedushah and need not be redeemed. This proves that it belongs to the Nochri.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> If the investor bears any decrease in value of the goods or any Ones, it is considered his. If not, it is the receiver's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rava):</span> If the investor bears any decrease in value or Ones, that is not Tzon Barzel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rava):</span> The Reisha permits accepting Tzon Barzel from a Nochri. It should distinguish within the case of Yisrael, and permit if the investor bears any decrease in value or Ones!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, in both cases the investor does not bear decrease in value or Ones;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bechorah does not apply because if the Yisrael does not return the estimated value, the Nochri will take the animal, and if he cannot, he will take the offspring;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Whenever a Nochri has rights in an animal, Bechorah does not apply.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>RIBIS FROM NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "One who gets rich through Ribis, l'Chonen Dalim Yikbetzenu (the one who is gracious to the poor will gather it)" - who is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Ii people like Shevor Malka (the Persian king, who would take from Yisrael and give to the Nochrim, who are poor in Mitzvos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> The verse teaches that even one who lends to a Nochri on Ribis will lose his money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava) Suggestion:</span> We read "la'Nochri Sashuch (you will take Ribis from him)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, we read "Sashich" (you will pay Ribis to him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is that a Mitzvah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. It excludes a Yisrael, to whom you may not pay Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Ul'Achicha Lo Sashich" forbids that!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "La'Nochri Sashich" adds an Isur derived from a Mitzvas Aseh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> We may borrow from or lend to a Nochri or Ger Toshav on Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya brei d'Rav Huna):</span> The Mishnah permits one to take Ribis from a Nochri only if he needs it to survive.</p>
