<p class="dedicationbox">GITIN 19 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>GET</i> SIGNED AFTER IT WAS WRITTEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reish Lakish said that R. Shimon permits only when they sign that night. If they sign (after this) during the next 10 days, it is Pasul!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi explains R. Shimon like R. Yochanan does (that if they sign within 10 days, it is valid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan says that only two are witnesses, and the rest may sign at any time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding that, he holds like Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT MAY BE USED TO WRITE A <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may write with anything, e.g. with ink, yellow dye, red lead, sap, vitriol or anything that lasts;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We may not write with drinks, fruit juice or anything that does not last.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We may write on anything, e.g. on an olive leaf, on a cow's horn or a slave's hand (and he must give to her the cow or slave);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi ha'Glili says, we may not write on something living, nor on food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does 'anything that lasts' come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It alludes to the law of R. Chanina's Beraisa, that if he wrote with rainwater (alternatively - water in which gall-nuts were soaked) or with gall-nuts, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> If he wrote with lead, coals, or vitriol, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> If one writes with black ink over red dye on Shabbos, he is liable for writing and for erasing;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If he writes with black ink over black ink, or red dye over red dye, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If one writes with red dye over black ink, some say that he is liable, and some say exempt:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say that he is liable, for he erases (covers) what was written;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Some exempt, for he ruins the writing.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WITNESSES WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SIGN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If witnesses do not know how to sign their names, may we write their names in red dye, and they will write over this in blank ink?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> You taught us that regarding Shabbos, the top writing is considered writing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Should we rely on our estimation in practice?! (What we said regarding Shabbos was not taught to be followed in practice, now that we lack Korbanos and Misas Beis Din.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we do if witnesses do not know how to sign their names?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> We scratch outlines of the letters of their names on a blank paper, and they fill in the outlines with ink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> We write their names with lead, and they write over our writing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chiya taught that writing with lead is a valid writing! (Therefore, writing on top of this is not called writing!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Scratching the paper with lead is not valid writing. Writing with water in which lead was soaked is valid (Rashi; Tosfos Rid explains oppositely.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Avahu):</span> We write their names with Mei Milin (water in which gall-nuts or acorns were soaked), and they write over our writing).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chanina taught that writing with Mei Milin is a valid writing (so writing on top of this is not called writing)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chanina discusses writing on paper that was not treated with gall-nuts. R. Avahu discusses when the paper was treated with gall-nuts;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In the latter case, the writing is Pasul, for Mei Milin does not show on paper treated with gall-nuts (since they are virtually the same color).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Papa):</span> We write their names in saliva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in which Rav Papa used saliva to enable Papa Tura'ah to sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>All these leniencies are only for Gitin, but not by other documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Someone helped the witnesses sign a monetary document in such a way, and Rav Kahana excommunicated him.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav - Beraisa):</span> If witnesses do not know how to sign their names, we scratch outlines of the letters of their names on a blank paper, and they put ink within the outlines;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, this is only for Gitei Nashim. For Gitin of freedom and other documents, witnesses may sign only if they know how to read and sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Shimon mention being able to read? The first Tana did not discuss this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows: If witnesses do not know how to read, we read the document aloud for them. If they do not know how to sign...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, this is only for Gitei Nashim. For Gitin of freedom and other documents, witnesses may sign only if they know how to read and sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> R. Shimon holds that we are lenient about Gitin of women, to avoid Igun (lest women be unable to remarry because there were not witnesses who knew how to sign).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gamda, citing Rava):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he mean that the Halachah follows Chachamim? Someone helped the witnesses sign a monetary document in this way, and Rav Kahana excommunicated him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Shimon regarding reading, i.e. if the witnesses can sign but cannot read, we read the document aloud for them, even by other documents.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DOCUMENTS IN OTHER LANGUAGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Yehudah was paining himself to read a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> Why struggle? R. Elazar is the greatest Chacham of Eretz Yisrael, and they read documents in front of him, and he signs. Rav Nachman asks a judge's scribe to read before him, and then he signs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Relying on one person reading) is permitted only if a judge's scribe reads, but not any scribe. It is permitted only for a Chacham like Rav Nachman (who was appointed by the Reish Galusa (Exilarch), who was his father-in-law).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>When a Persian document written by the Nochri courts would come in front of Rav Papa, he would ask two Nochrim to read it in front of him, in different rooms. They did not know why he wanted them to read it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After this he would accept the document, and use it to collect even from Meshubadim (property that the borrower sold).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> We use a Persian document signed by Yisre'elim to collect even from Meshubadim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The witnesses do not know how to read it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they know.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We require writing that cannot be (erased and) forged!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The paper was treated with gall-nuts. (Therefore, the writing cannot be erased.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The last line of the document must summarize the document!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is Rav Ashi's Chidush? A Mishnah teaches that a document may be in any language!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Get was written in Hebrew, and the witnesses signed in Yevanis, or vice-versa, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we only allow this for Gitin, like the Mishnah discusses. Rav Ashi teaches that we allow it for all documents.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>CASES IN WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED LEST A <i>GET</i> WAS GIVEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a man gave to his wife a blank paper, and said 'here is your Get', she is divorced. We are concerned lest he wrote it with Mei Milin (later, it disappears).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A man told his wife, 'here is your Get.' She took it and destroyed it. Her husband then said that it was an invalid monetary document. She is divorced; her husband is not believed to forbid her to remarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> She may remarry only because the paper had writing on it. If not, she would be forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel said that she is divorced only when we check the paper with a special dye that makes the writing reappear. If it does not reappear, she is not divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When she received it, the writing was not there!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel said that we are concerned. (She is doubtfully divorced. Perhaps the writing had not fully faded, and the Get was still legible when she received it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> The Edei Mesirah must read the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A man told his wife, 'here is your Get.' She took it and destroyed it. Her husband then said that it was an invalid monetary document. She is divorced; her husband is not believed to forbid her to remarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the witnesses must read the Get, how could he claim it was a invalid monetary document?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After the witnesses read it, he stuck it up his sleeve, and then gave it to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that we are concerned lest he switched it and gave her a different paper. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A man threw a Get to his wife among barrels. Only a Mezuzah was found.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> A Mezuzah is not generally found among barrels. Surely, he threw a Mezuzah there. She is certainly not divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if two or three Mezuzos were found, just like the others were there from before, perhaps all were there from before. We are concerned lest he threw her a Get, and mice took it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>A man entered a Beis ha'Keneses, took a Sefer Torah, gave it to his wife, and said that it is her Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Is there any reason to be concerned (lest this is a Get)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he wrote a Get in Mei Milin in the margin, and now we cannot see it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Sefer Torah is treated with gall-nuts. Such writing would never have been legible on the parchment.</p>
