<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #3 (Rava):</span> The case is, he said 'be Mekudeshes to me with Zikas Yevamin';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi holds that Yesh Zikah. Chalitzah uprooted the Zikah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that Ein Zikah. Just like Kidushin 'with Zikas Yevamin' works before Chalitzah, it works after Chalitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sharbiya):</span> After a proper Chalitzah, all agree that Kidushin 'with Zikas Yevamin' would not work!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #4 (Rav Sharbiya):</span> Rather, they argue about after a Chalitzah Pesulah. Rebbi holds that a Chalitzah Pesulah exempts; Chachamim hold that it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> All hold that a Chalitzah Pesulah does not exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #5 (Rav Ashi):</span> Rather, they argue about whether or not Chalitzah can be made conditional. Chachamim hold that it can; Rebbi holds that it cannot (the Tenai is Batel, and the Chalitzah is valid in any case.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Ravina):</span> All hold that Chalitzah can be made conditional!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #6 (Ravina):</span> The case is, Chalitzah was conditional without a Tenai Kaful (he did not explicitly say that if the condition is not fulfilled the Chalitzah will be Batel). Chachamim do not require a Tenai Kaful. Rebbi requires a Tenai Kaful (without it, the Chalitzah works unconditionally).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he did Chalitzah, and gave a Ma'amar, or a Get, or had Bi'ah (nothing takes effect after Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't the Mishnah also say that nothing takes effect after Bi'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> Indeed, the text should say so (and we know that likewise, nothing takes effect after Chalitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Our Tana prefers to teach that nothing takes effect after Chalitzah, since this permits her to marry others. (Tosfos Yeshanim - according to our text, there is no Machlokes Tana'im. Abaye and Rava corrected the text! Rather, the proper text of the Gemara does not cite Abaye and Rava. Rather, the Gemara cites the Tosefta that ends 'nothing takes effect after Bi'ah'.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE CASE OF TWO <i>YEVAMOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This applies when there is one Yavam, whether there is one Yevamah or two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Our Mishnah is unlike Ben Azai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Ben Azai):</span> A Ma'amar takes effect after a Ma'amar when there are two Yevamim and one Yevamah, but not when there are two Yevamos and one Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he gave a Ma'amar (to one Yevamah and did Chalitzah to the other, the former needs a Get).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah supports Shmuel <i>or</i> refutes Rav Yosef!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If Ba'alas ha'Ma'amar does Chalitzah, the Tzarah is not exempted. (This is why the Mishnah discusses Chalitzah to the Tzarah. Rav Yosef taught that if one Yevamah is Kosher to Kehunah and one is Pasul, one does Chalitzah to the Pesulah. If Shmuel is wrong, Chalitzah of Ba'alas ha'Ma'amar (who becomes Pasul to Kehunah through a Get) would exempt both of them, yet the Mishnah sanctions Chalitzah to the Tzarah, unlike Rav Yosef!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is no support or refutation. It does not say that one <i>must</i> (or may) do Chalitzah to the other, rather, <i>if</i> one did!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he gave a Get to each (they need Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah supports Rabah bar Rav Huna.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> A Chalitzah Pesulah must be repeated by all the brothers (The Mishnah says "likewise, when there are two Yevamim and one Yevamah" [she must do Chalitzah with each brother]).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. <i>They</i> need Chalitzah does not mean both Yevamos in this case. Rather, whenever this case occurs, one of the Yevamos must do Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he gave a Get to one, and Chalitzah to the other...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah supports Shmuel, or refutes Rav Yosef (like above).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is no support or refutation. It does not say that one <i>must</i> (or may) do Chalitzah to the other, rather, <i>if</i> one did!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he did Chalitzah to both... (nothing takes effect after Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't it also say that nothing takes effect after Bi'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> Indeed, the text should say so! (Tosfos Yeshanim - indeed, the Tosefta says so!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Our Tana prefers to teach that nothing takes effect after Chalitzah, since this permits her to marry others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This applies whether there is one Yavam and two Yevamos...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, according to R. Yochanan (who says that after Chalitzah, all the Tzaros are Chayavei Lavin to all the Yevamim), the Mishnah teaches that Ein Kidushin Tofsin b'Chayavei Lavin (like R. Akiva);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to Reish Lakish (who says that they are Chayavei Kerisus), must the Mishnah teach that Ein Kidushin Tofsin b'Chayavei Kerisus?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Seifa):</span> If one did Yibum and the other gave her a Ma'amar...</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Must the Mishnah teach that one cannot Mekadesh another man's wife?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> Since it needed to teach about one Yevamah and one Yavam (all agree that after Chalitzah only a Lav forbids her), it teaches that the same applies to two Yevamos and one Yavam, and due to this it teaches that the same applies to one Yavamah and two Yevamim.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WE DID NOT DECREE AFTER <i>CHALITZAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he did Chalitzah, gave a Ma'amar or a Get... (nothing takes effect after Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, if he did Chalitzah and gave a Ma'amar, it must teach that we do not decree (to require a Get for) a Ma'amar after Chalitzah due to a Ma'amar before Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, why must it teach that a Get after Chalitzah does nothing?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Seifa):</span> If he did Yibum and gave a Ma'amar, or did Yibum and gave a Get...</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Granted, if he did Yibum and gave a Get, it must teach that we do not decree (to require Chalitzah after) a Get after Yibum due to a Get before Yibum. However, why must it teach that a Ma'amar after Yibum does nothing?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that since we taught about Ma'amar after Chalitzah, we also taught about Ma'amar after Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Likewise, since we had to teach about Get after Yibum, we also taught about Get after Chalitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Whether Chalitzah is at the beginning, middle or end, nothing takes effect after it.) Things takes effect after Bi'ah if it is in the middle or at the end.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Our Mishnah is unlike Aba Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Yosi ben Yochanan):</span> Bi'ah is like Chalitzah. At the beginning, nothing takes effect after them. In the middle or end, things take effect after them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>There are three opinions among the Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana of the Mishnah holds that we decree only after (Pasul) Yibum, since then there is a concern;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Nechemyah holds that also regarding Bi'ah there is no need to decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Above we said that we decree about Yibum after a Get due to Yibum after Chalitzah. R. Nechemyah holds that since Chalitzah is mid'Oraisa, people know that Yibum cannot come later.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Above we said that we decree about Yibum after a Ma'amar due to Bi'ah after Bi'ah. R. Nechemyah holds that since Yibum is mid'Oraisa, people know that another Yibum cannot be done.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Aba Yosi holds like Chachamim who decree about Bi'ah, and he decrees about Chalitzah due to Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'BA AL YEVIMTO</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT KINDS OF <i>BI'AH</i> ACQUIRE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Yavam had Bi'ah with his Yevamah he acquired her, whether he was Shogeg or Mezid (intending), whether forced or willing, even if he was Shogeg and she was Mezidah, or vice-versa, or he was forced and she was not, or vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This is whether he did only Ha'ara'ah (the first stage of Bi'ah) or the full act. We do not distinguish different types of Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Similarly, if one had Bi'ah with any Ervah in the Torah, e.g. a Kohen Gadol with a widow, a regular Kohen with a Chalutzah, a Yisrael with a Mamzeres or Nesinah or vice-versa, she is disqualified. We do not distinguish between different kinds of Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Why does it say 'even (if he was Shogeg)'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He acquires her not only when he is Shogeg or Mezid (intending for Zenus) and she intends for the Mitzvah, rather, even when he is Shogeg and she is Mezidah, and neither intends for the Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chiya):</span> Even if both are Shogegim, Mezidim, or forced (he acquires her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Mishnah, what is the case of being forced?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Nochrim forced him to have Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rava taught that a man is never considered forced regarding Arayos, since Kishuy (an erection) comes only willfully!</p>
