<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WE MUST USE A SPIT OF POMEGRANATE WOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> To roast Korban Pesach, we bring a spit of pomegranate wood and insert it through the mouth to the rump; the feet and innards are [removed to be washed, and placed] inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> That is (Me'iri - looks) like Bishul (cooking through water - the feet and innards are cooked by the juice inside the animal, not by the fire)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, the feet and innards hang [on the spit] outside the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One may not roast Pesach on a [metal] spit or griddle (the animal is cooked by the heat of the griddle, not by the fire);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Tzadok says, R. Gamliel once told his slave Tavi to roast Pesach on a griddle.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why can't a metal spit be used?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Metal conducts heat well -] when part of a metal spit gets hot (the part outside the animal, for it is exposed to the fire), all of it gets hot - the [inside of] the animal will be roasted by the spit;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah requires "Tzeli Esh" - it must be roasted by the fire, not by anything else.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't a spit of date wood be used?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it has grooves, sap exudes, the animal will be Mevushal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't a spit of fig wood be used?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It has cavities inside and sap exudes, this is like Bishul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't a spit of oak, carob or sycamore wood be used?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since they have bulges [which must be cut off], sap exudes where they are cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Pomegranate wood also has bulges!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Its bulges are smooth (they need not be removed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We use pomegranate wood of a sapling in its first year, which has no bulges.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Sap will exude from the end of the spit (it was cut there)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The cut end is outside the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>Our Mishnah us unlike R. Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Just like [the part of] a wooden spit [inside an animal is shielded from getting too hot and] does not burn, a metal spit does not get so hot [inside to roast the animal].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> When part of a metal spit gets hot, all of it gets hot - this is not true regarding wood.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CONSIDERATIONS WHEN ROASTING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The feet and innards are inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> This is called "Toch Toch" (it makes a noise like a boiling pot; alternatively, it is called Tuchbar - it is stuffed inside (Toch), this is noticeable from the outside (Bar)).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Tarfon says, it is called Gedi Mekulas (a kid with a helmet, for the feet and innards are outside its head).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is a Gedi Mekulas, which one may not eat nowadays on Pesach night [lest it look like he eats Kodshim]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a kid roasted whole - but if [even] one limb was cut off or Mevushal, this is not Mekulas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is permitted when a limb was cut off, even if the limb was roasted with it, obviously it is permitted when a limb was [cut off and] Mevushal!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> It permits even if a limb was Mevushal while still attached.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Mulyasa (an animal or fowl stuffed with meat and roasted) is permitted [even if the meat was not salted].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> [Usually, roasting suffices in place of salting because it causes the blood to drip out - but here,] the blood will leave the stuffing and be absorbed by the outer animal!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> K'Bol'o Kach Polto (just like the outer animal absorbs blood [from the stuffing], it will emit it. The following supports are for Rabah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> The feet and innards are inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is permitted because k'Bol'o Kach Polto!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, there is different, because the [cut] neck is hollow, the blood drips out.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">74b----------------------------------------74b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One tears the heart [of any animal] to remove the blood; if he did not tear it, he tears it after cooking it, and it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> [The case is, it was roasted (this is also called 'cooking';] it is permitted because k'Bol'o Kach Polto!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The heart is different because it is smooth (it does not absorb blood).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> Ravin the elder coated a chick in dough for Rav; Rav said, if it gives a good taste to the dough, I will eat it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The dough was from Soles (high quality flour) - it crumbles, enabling the blood to drip out.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava visited the Reish Galusa; they roasted a coated goose for him. He said, had I not seen [the juice of the meat flowing in the flour] as white as a coin, I would not eat it [lest it absorbed blood];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If k'Bol'o Kach Polto, it should be permitted in any case! (Sefas Emes - the text of some Rishonim says that above <i>Rava</i> answered K'Bol'o Kach Polto - according to our text, it is not clear what is difficult if Rava argues with Rabah, for also Abaye argued with him!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The dough was from clean flour (not Soles) - it makes a hard coating, all agree that the blood cannot drip out.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p>The Halachah is - regarding Soles, it is permitted even if it (the juice in the coating) is red (surely, this is not due to blood, it would have left);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding clean flour, it is permitted only if it (the juice) is as white as a coin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding other flour, it is permitted as long as it is not red.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p>The opinion that forbids Mulyasa (Abaye, who rejected Rabah's prrofs) forbids even if the mouth of the animal is down [and blood could flow out]; Rabah permits even if the mouth is up (the heat draws the blood out of the meat).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE STRINGENCIES OF RAVINA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Ravina and Rav Acha argue about meat, testicles, and big veins in the neck (these will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Everywhere Ravina and Rav Acha argue [without specifying which opinion is Rav Acha's and which is Ravina's], Rav Acha is stringent and Ravina is lenient, except for these three Halachos, in which Ravina is stringent and Rav Acha is lenient;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In all cases, the Halachah follows the lenient opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If meat reddened [due to a blow]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one cut it and salted it (this removes all the blood, all agree that) one may cook it even in a pot;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One may roast it on a spit, for the blood will flow down;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They argue about roasting it on coals:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One holds that this constricts it (stops the blood from leaving) - the blood will be absorbed in the meat;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The other holds that this draws out the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The same applies to testicles (Rashi - that reddened; Tosfos - because a membrane covers them):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they were cut and salted, one may cook them even in a pot; one may roast them on a spit, for the blood will flow down;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They argue about roasting them on coals - one holds that this constricts them, the other holds that it draws out the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The same applies to big veins in the neck - if they were cut and salted, one may cook them in a pot; one may roast them on a spit with the side towards the neck facing down, for the blood will flow down;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about roasting them on coals - one holds that this constricts them, the other holds that it draws out the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Halachah is, coals draw out the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If Chalyei (Rashi - the juice that exudes from reddened meat; alternatively, vinegar in which one was Cholet reddened meat (soaked it after roasting, to extract the blood - Rashi; Riva - the raw meat is soaked briefly in vinegar to cause the blood to remain inside) reddened, it is forbidden; if not, it is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Ravina forbids even if it did not redden, for surely it contains traces of blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Mar bar Ameimar told Rav Ashi 'My father used to drink it (the juice or vinegar).'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rav Ashi used to drink it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Mar bar Ameimar (to Rav Ashi):</span> My father would not use the same vinegar to Cholet more than once [for it uses up its strength].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it different than weak vinegar [which may be used]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The shartpness of weak vinegar is intact - here, its shartpness has been expended.</p></div>
