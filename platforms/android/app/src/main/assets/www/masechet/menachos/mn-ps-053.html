<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Freida) Question:</span> What is the source that all Menachos are Matzah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Ami):</span> This is obvious! Regarding some Menachos it says "Matzah". We learn the others from "v'Zos Toras ha'Minchah... veha'Noseres...Matzos Te'achel"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Freida:</span> I know the source that l'Chatchilah, they must be Matzah. I asked for the source that this is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ami):</span> We learn that from "Lo Se'afeh Chametz", rather, Matzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> Why don't we expound "Lo Se'afeh Chametz", rather, Sei'or (partially fermented dough)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which definition of Sei'or could this be?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>According to R. Yehudah, it cannot be what R. Meir calls Sei'or (a dough that starts darkening). R. Yehudah considers this to be proper Matzah! (If so, Rav Chisda had no question.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>According to R. Meir, it cannot be what R. Yehudah calls Sei'or (a dough with cracks resembling grasshopper antennae). R. Meir considers this to be proper Chametz!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>According to R. Meir, it cannot be what he himself calls Sei'or. Since he says that one is lashed for eating it on Pesach, it is Chametz!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is according to R. Yehudah, based on what he himself calls Sei'or.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Why don't we expound "Lo Se'afeh Chametz", rather, Chalut (scalded in boiling water)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chalut is "Revichah". Only Menachos that the Torah says should be Revichah are made Revichah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Torah commands to make some Menachos Revichah, and the others may be Revichah or Matzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #3 (Ravina):</span> We should say that "Lo Se'afeh Chametz" is a Lav forbidding making them Chametz, but this does not Posel Menachos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Matzah" is only a Mitzvah (l'Chatchilah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Sihyeh" - it is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Freida):</span> What is the source (of the next Mishnah, 55a) that (since) all Menachos are kneaded with lukewarm water, we must be Shomer (guard) them from becoming Chametz (by constantly working with the dough?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ami):</span> We learn from Pesach. There it says "u'Shmartem Es ha'Matzos."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Freida):</span> We can learn from the Parshah of Menachos itself. It says "Matzah Sihyeh" - ensure that it remains Matzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already expounded "Sihyeh" to teach that Matzah is Me'akev!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the Torah only wanted to teach that Matzah is Me'akev, it should have said 'Matzah Hi';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it says "Matzah Sihyeh", to teach also Shimur.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Freida:</span> If he is a Chacham of good lineage, that is great;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he descends from Chachamim but he is not a Chacham, fire will consume him! (Tzon Kodoshim - Chachamim are not burned in Gehinom.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rav Freida saw that R. Ezra (Rashi; R. Gershom - R. Ezra saw that Rav Freida) felt bad. He said the following to endear him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Amarta la'Shem Elokim Atah Tovasi Bal Alecha" - Keneses Yisrael said to Hash-m, You should be grateful to me. I made You known in the world!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Ha'Shem responded, My gratitude is to Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov. They were the first to make Me known - "Li'Kedoshim Asher ba'Aretz Hemah v'Adirei Kol Cheftzi Bam"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Ezra (according to R. Gershom - Rav Freida):</span> Hash-m said (at the time of Keri'as Yam Suf), let the Adir (Mighty One) take vengeance for Adirim from Adirim in Adirim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Adirim referred to are (in order) Hash-m, Yisrael, Mitzrayim and water. Each is called "Adir" in a verse.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Avraham:</span> I came to pray for my children!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p>Avraham put his hand on his head and was crying. Perhaps nothing will save them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">A Bas Kol:</span> "Zayis Ra'anan... Kara Hash-m Shmech" - just like the greatness of olive trees is in the end (after many years, they bear fruit. Alternatively, no olives ripen early. All ripen at the end), also the greatness of Yisrael is in the end. (They will repent in the days of Moshi'ach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> "L'Kol ha'Mulah Gedolah... v'Ra'u Daliyosav" - the Milim (words) of the Meraglim made the weak of Yisrael falter;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> The Meraglim said a great blasphemy. We explain "Ki Chazak Hu Mimenu (the Kena'anim in Eretz Yisrael are stronger than us)" to mean than Him, as if the Master cannot enter His own house!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection: (R. Chiya b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> If so (the blasphemous word made them falter), it should say 'l'Kol ha'Milah Gedolah'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, Hash-m told Avraham 'I heard your voice; Chamalti (I had mercy. Chamalti is like 'ha'Mulah', for 'Hei' and 'Ches' are interchangeable);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(Initially, it was fixed how long Yisrael must be exiled under each of the four kingdoms.) I had decided that they will suffer under each like the total amount decreed for all four. Now I revert to the initial quota of each.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Some explain, I had decided that they will suffer under each one after the other. Now I will cause that the exiles overlap (Yisrael will be scattered, some under one kingdom, and others under another.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Yisrael are compared to an olive tree. Just like an olive tree does not drop its leaves in winter or summer, Yisrael is never Batel, not in this world, nor in the world to come.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Yisrael are compared to olives. Just like olives do not give their oil until they are pressed, Yisrael do not repent until they are afflicted.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> We take some flour from the Isaron...(R. Yehudah says... Chachamim say, if so, there will be too much or too little flour!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is there too much, and when is there too little?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> If the Se'or was kneaded thickly (with little water, it has more flour per unit volume than pure flour), so there will be too much flour in the Minchah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was kneaded thinly (with much water), there will be too little flour.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In any case, the measure was filled to an Isaron!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> The original volume of the flour (i.e. when it was flour) must be an Isaron. Since the Se'or helped fill the measure, we are lacking (or have an excess of) the difference in volume of the Se'or and its flour.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> Why don't we fill the Isaron with flour, take some out, ferment it (by putting it in a hot place, or amidst Chametz) and knead it with the rest!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decreed not to, lest one who sees this add 'outside' Se'or to a full Isaron of flour.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> Why don't we put (old) Se'or in the Isaron, fill the rest with flour, take some flour out, knead it with the same amount of water as the Se'or, return it and measure the difference? Surely, its volume changed like the Se'or. We now know how much flour we must add or take away!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decreed not to, lest one who sees this take flour from outside the Isaron, knead it and add it to the Isaron.</p></div>
