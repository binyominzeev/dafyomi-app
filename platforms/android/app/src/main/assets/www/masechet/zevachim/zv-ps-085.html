<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>LIABILITY FOR OFFERING OUTSIDE THE <i>MIKDASH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a (Kodesh) animal was slaughtered at night in the Mikdash, one who offers it outside (on a Bamah) is Chayav (Kares). Shechitah at night is no 'worse' (more Pasul than) Shechutei Chutz (and we know that one who offers Shechutei Chutz outside is liable for this <i>and</i> for the Shechitah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Avin - Mishnah):</span> If one slaughtered a (Kodesh) bird inside (the Mikdash) and offered it outside, he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he slaughtered and offered it outside, he is liable (for both of these).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to R. Yochanan, Shechitah inside should be no worse than Shechitah outside. He should be liable (for offering outside) also in the first case!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yochanan is refuted;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Alternatively, we can answer for R. Yochanan. Shechitah <i>of a bird</i> inside is indeed worse than Shechitah outside. Inside one must do Melikah, and not slaughter. It is as if it were killed without Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>EIMURIM</i> BROUGHT UP BEFORE <i>ZERIKAH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If Eimurim of Kodshim Kalim Alu before Zerikah, Lo Yerdu, for they became 'food' of the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (R. Zeira - Mishnah):</span> If the blood spilled, or the blood left the Azarah (R. Yehudah says Yered, R. Shimon says Lo Yered);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There, Zerikah cannot be done, yet Lo Yered. Here, Zerikah can be done, all the more so Lo Yered!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (of support):</span> (Perhaps) the Mishnah discusses (only) Kodshei Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Later it mentions Korban Pesach, which is Kodshim Kalim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It discusses Pesach only with respect to Lo Lishmah, but not to the previous cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If any of them (the Pesulim mentioned above) Alah when alive, Yered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If any of them Alah after Shechitah, Lo Yered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This applies to Kodshim Kalim and Kodshei Kodoshim alike.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the inference is, if it came up slaughtered, in some cases (Kodshim Kalim) Yered, in some cases (Kodshei Kodoshim) Lo Yered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says <i>any</i> of them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is for the simple meaning (not the inference), that if any of them Alah when alive, Yered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is regarding Dukin in the eye, according to R. Akiva, who says Lo Yered regarding such Mumim (if already slaughtered).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The next clause proves that the Mishnah discusses Kosher Korbanos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if an Olah came up alive, Yered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was slaughtered on the Mizbe'ach, it is flayed and dissected on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A Pasul Olah is not (Rashi - need not be) dissected!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"V'Nitach <i>Osah</i>" - a Kosher Olah is dissected, but not a Pasul one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Seifa discusses a Kosher Korban (but the previous clause does not).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p><i>EIMURIM</i> BROUGHT UP BEFORE <i>ZERIKAH</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush of the Seifa?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It teaches that we may flay and dissect on top of the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that we may not flay and dissect on top of the Mizbe'ach, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, it was once Kosher to be offered and became Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah is like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon, who says that once Kosher Zerikah was done, (if it later became Pasul) we flay it and Kohanim receive the skin. (If it was on the Mizbe'ach at the time, we dissect it there and offer it, for if we take it down, it will be forbidden to bring it up again.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> We take the innards down and rinse them (We would not do so if it were Pasul, for then they cannot be offered!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Indeed, even if it is Pasul, we must do so.) Should we offer the innards with the Peresh (excrement in the intestines)?! "Hakrivehu Na l'Fechasecha...(if you would give a sickly animal to your governor for a gift, would he accept it and favor you due to it?!" Likewise, one should not offer repulsive Korbanos!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it were Pasul, we would not rinse them. Perhaps a Kohen will see them and (unaware that the Korban was Pasul) offer them;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">85b----------------------------------------85b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim would not sanction something that may cause one to transgress!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a disgrace to leave the innards covered with Peresh like a carcass. This overrides the concern for transgression.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Chiya bar Aba) Question (R. Yochanan):</span> If Eimurim of Kodshim Kalim came up before Zerikah, do we take them down?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following Pesulim were not b'Kodesh...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Akiva is Machshir only a film over the eye (or other minor Mumim), for this does not disqualify birds;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Min ha'Behemah" excludes Rove'a and Nirva. Perhaps this applies only to an animal, which can be Rove'a (have relations with a woman) <i>and</i> be Nirva, but not to a bird, which can only be Nirva!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since a transgression was done with the bird, it is forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah - Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> A Ba'al Mum is not taken down (for this does not disqualify birds);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Nirva bird was Kosher, R. Akiva would say Lo Yered also regarding a Nirva (animal)!</p></div>
