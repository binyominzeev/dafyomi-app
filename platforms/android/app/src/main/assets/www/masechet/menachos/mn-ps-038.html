<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Ravina immediately told Mar bar Rav Ashi that a corner of his garment had snapped off.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Mar bar Rav Ashi:</span> Do you think I must take off my garment right away? Kavod ha'Briyos overrides a Lav!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav bar Sheva explained that it overrides only the Lav of Lo Sasur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mar bar Rav Ashi was not walking in Reshus ha'Rabim, rather, in a Karmelis, where the Isur to carry is only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="perekline"><p>PEREK HA'TECHELES</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TECHELES AND LAVAN ARE NOT ME'AKEV EACH OTHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (The Torah commands to put woolen strings dyed Techeles on each of the four corners of a garment, in addition to Lavan, i.e. strings that are the same color as the garment, which is usually white.) Techeles is not Me'akev the Lavan, and Lavan is not Me'akev the Techeles;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Tefilin Shel Yad is not Me'akev the Shel Rosh, nor vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike Rebbi!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "U'Re'isim Oso" - Techeles and Lavan are Me'akev each other;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, they are not Me'akev each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "ha'Kanaf" - strings like the corner (i.e. Lavan), and "Pesil Techeles", and it says "u'Re'isim Oso" (singular), to teach that both must both be in one parcel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Chachamim explain that the singular teaches that you see each of them by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah can even be like Rebbi. It teaches that the order is not Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Mitzvah is to put the Lavan first (Rashi - in each corner; Shitah Mekubetzes - the first windings of one string around the others should be Lavan). If one put Techeles first, he was Yotzei, but he missed a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Mitzvah did he miss?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">38b----------------------------------------38b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He missed the Mitzvah of Lavan, but fulfilled the Mitzvah of Techeles.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is unlike Rebbi. He says that each is Me'akev the other!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> He lacks a Mitzvah, and fulfilled a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Mitzvah does he lack?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not do the Mitzvah in the best way.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This explains 'Lavan is not Me'akev Techeles.' How do we explain 'Techeles is not Me'akev Lavan'? (Shitah Mekubetzes deletes Rami bar Chama's answer from the text here; it appears later.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Levi asked similarly:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Levi):</span> How do you explain 'Techeles is not Me'akev Lavan, and Lavan is not Me'akev Techeles'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> This (the latter clause) teaches about a white garment. The Mitzvah is to put the Lavan first;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "ha'Kanaf" - strings like the corner. (Afterwards, it says "Pesil Techeles");</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>If Techeles was put first, this is not Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Levi):</span> This explains ' Lavan is not Me'akev Techeles.' How do you explain ' Techeles is not Me'akev Lavan '?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> This teaches about a garment that is entirely Techeles. The Mitzvah is to put Techeles first, for this is like "ha'Kanaf";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Lavan was put first, this is not Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> It does not depend on the color of the garment! (We always put Lavan first.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>REMNANTS OF TZITZIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It teaches about remnants (if strings snapped. The Reisha teaches that) if the Techeles strings snapped and the Lavan remains, it is Kosher. (The Seifa teaches that) if the Lavan snapped and the Techeles remains, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Bnei R. Chiya):</span> Remnants of Techeles (or Lavan strings) are Kosher. Remnants of Ezov branches are Kosher (for Parah Adumah or Metzora).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much must remain?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Bar Hameduri):</span> Enough must remain in order that one could make a bow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must one be able to make a bow (one string around) all the strings, or each by itself?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If one could not make a bow because the strings were thick, but if they were thinner one could, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If they were thin, it would be Kosher. All the more so it is Kosher if the strings are thicker, for the Mitzvah is more recognizable! (Rema - we estimate with average strings.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are the Chachamim who argue with Rebbi?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like R. Yitzchak;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yitzchak):</span> If one does not have Techeles, he puts Lavan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We learn from Bnei R. Chiya that one must tie the strings together after each Chulya (winding. Shitah Mekubetzes - really, we show only that it is not enough to tie after the last Chulya. Tosfos - presumably, they must be tied between each Chulya and the next);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If this were not necessary, if only a small remnant remained, the last knot would become undone, and the whole Gedil (windings) would become undone!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps it is not necessary. Bnei R. Chiya taught that remnants are Kosher only in a case in which the strings happened to be tied!</p></div>
