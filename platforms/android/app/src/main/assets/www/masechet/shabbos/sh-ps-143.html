<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RAVA FORBIDS <i>MUKTZEH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it could be eaten raw, Rava would forbid - this shows that he forbids Muktzeh, like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But [on Yom Tov] Rava asked his servant to roast a goose and throw its intestines to a cat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the intestines would spoil before nightfall, from before Yom Tov he intended to feed them to a cat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> The following shows that Rava holds like R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> [On Yom Tov] a woman may not enter a storehouse of wood to take a stick for a roasting spit (the wood is set aside for burning);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a spit broke, one may not burn it, for we may burn Kelim on Yom Tov, but not broken Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SOMETHING THAT USED TO BE PART OF A FOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> We may remove bones and peels from the table;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel say, we take the entire Tavla (a board placed over the table), and shake it (casting them off).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We remove from the table crumbs less than a k'Zayis, and the pods (Aruch - and chaff and sprigs) of peas and of lentils, for animals eat them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If a sponge has a leather handle, one may clean with it; if not, not (he would surely squeeze between his fingers);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> In either case one may take it on Shabbos; it is not Mekabel Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Chachamim say, in either case one may use and take it on Shabbos; it is not Mekabel Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Nachman):</span> The opinions in our Mishnah must be switched - Beis Shamai forbid Muktzeh like R. Yehudah, Beis Hillel permit like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may remove crumbs [less than a k'Zayis] from the table.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Our Mishnah supports R. Yochanan:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi) (R. Yochanan):</span> One may not ruin crumbs less than a k'Zayis (the Mishnah says that we remove them, it does not permit to throw them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) (R. Yochanan):</span> One may ruin crumbs less than a k'Zayis (the Mishnah calls them animal food).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Pods of peas...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Our Mishnah is like R. Shimon, who permits Muktzeh (at the start of Shabbos they were a useful part of food for people, now they are only fit for animals).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If a sponge has a leather handle, one may clean with it; if not, not (lest he squeeze).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like R. Yehudah, who forbids Davar she'Eino Miskaven!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa is even like R. Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> R. Shimon agrees regarding a Pesik Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>One may cast pits of bad dates to animals, by way of the date itself (Rashi - people feed bad dates to animals; Rashi (29A) - some of the fruit sticks to them, they are still fit for people; rch - the pits are soft, people can be eat them with the date);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not cast pits of good dates to animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel would move them via bread. (Tosfos - even he holds like R. Shimon, he was stringent, because he was important.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>This is like Shmuel taught elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may use bread for anything [that will not make it repulsive].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Rabah would move them via a flask of water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua piled them up in front of himself (so they would repulse him), making them like Geraf Shel Re'i (which may be removed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> One may not make Geraf Shel Re'i l'Chatchilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>Rav Sheshes would throw them [across the table] with his tongue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Papa would throw them in back of his bed [on which he ate].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Zecharyah ben Avkulas would turn away and spit them out in back of his bed.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SQUEEZING FRUIT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a barrel broke, one may save food for three meals; he may tell others to save for themselves, as long as he does not soak up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We may not squeeze fruit to extract the juice; if the juice came out by itself, it is forbidden [on Shabbos];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, if the owner planned to eat the fruit, the juice is permitted; if he planned to extract the juice, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If cakes of honey were crushed before Shabbos and the honey flowed out on Shabbos, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Elazar permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> One may not soak up wine, one may not wet his hand in oil [and scrape the oil into a Kli], for this is like one does on a weekday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If produce scattered in a Chatzer, he gathers it bit by bit and eats; he may not gather into a basket or box, for this is like one does on a weekday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not squeeze fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Yehudah agrees regarding olives and grapes [that what flows from them is forbidden, even if he planned to eat them].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People normally squeeze them - even if he planned to eat them, he is pleased with the liquid that flowed from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> R. Yehudah argues even regarding olives and grapes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah regarding other fruits, the Halachah follows Chachamim regarding olives and grapes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> R. Yehudah agrees to Chachamim regarding olives and grapes; Chachamim agree to R. Yehudah regarding other fruits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> If so, what do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> Think about it, you will find the answer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Presumably, they argue about strawberries and pomegranates:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Ri) (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If oil and wine were extracted from olives and grapes, and one stored them, whether to eat them or to get more juice from them, what exudes is forbidden [on Shabbos];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi) (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If oil and wine flowed from olives and grapes, whether one [initially] stored them to eat them or to get more juice from them, what exudes is forbidden; (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If juice and wine were extracted (Rashi - flowed) from strawberries and pomegranates, and one stored them to eat them, what exudes is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he stored them for juice or Stam (without specific intent), what exudes is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim say, in either case what exudes is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah does not forbid Stam!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Human milk is Tamei whether it came out l'Ratzon (willingly) or Lo l'Ratzon; an animal's milk is Tamei only if it came out l'Ratzon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> We learn from a Kal va'Chomer - human milk is only for babies, it is Tamei l'Ratzon and Lo l'Ratzon - an animal's milk is even for adults, all the more so it is Tamei l'Ratzon and Lo l'Ratzon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No - a woman's milk is Tamei even Lo l'Ratzon, for blood of her wounds is [Lo l'Ratzon yet] Tamei (Rashi - a woman's milk is produced from her blood; Tosfos (Nidah 19B Kesiv) - we merely prove from her blood that some of her fluids are Tamei Lo l'Ratzon);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>You cannot learn to milk of animals, blood of their wounds is Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Milk is more stringent than blood, for milk milked for a cure is Tamei, but if one lets blood to heal, it is Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Baskets of olives and grapes disprove this - liquid that comes out l'Ratzon is Tamei, Lo l'Ratzon is Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> 'L'Ratzon' means, he wanted it to exude, 'Lo l'Ratzon' means, Stam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Even though olives and grapes are normally squeezed, liquid that comes out Stam is Tahor - all the more so regarding strawberries and pomegranates, which are not normally squeezed! (If Chachamim of this Mishnah hold like R. Yehudah, this is a direct question; if these Chachamim hold like the Chachamim that argue with R. Yehudah, all the more so he is Metaher Stam, for they consider it a liquid, and he does not!)</p>
