<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE COLORS OF <i>TAMEI</i> BLOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are five Tamei colors of blood -- red, black, like the radiance of saffron, like water on earth, and like mixed wine. (These will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Shamai is Metamei also blood like Meimei Tilsan (water in which fenugreek was soaked) or like juice that exudes from roasting meat;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Hillel is Metaher these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Akavya ben Mehalalel is Metamei Yarok. (Almost all Rishonim say that (plain) Yarok is yellow. Green is called Yarok k'Karsi (like leeks). Me'iri - Yarok is green, but all are Metamei yellow);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim are Metaher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Meir says, (even) if a Yarok Kesem is not Tamei, the blood is a liquid (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yosi says, it is neither.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Red is like blood of a wound. Black is like Cheres (vitriol, used to make ink);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anything more Amuk (Rashi - dark; R. Chananel - light) than Cheres is Tamei. Anything more Dehah ((R. Chananel - much) lighter) than it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The other colors referred to are choice leaves of saffron (this will be explained), water poured on earth of Beis Kerem, and two measures of water mixed with one measure of Sharoni wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that there are Tahor colors of blood? Perhaps all colors are Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chama bar Yosef):</span> "Ki Yipalei... Bein Dam l'Dam" refers to (a Zaken Mamrei arguing with the Sanhedrin about) a question of Tahor Dam or Tamei Dam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, will you say that "Bein Nega l'Nega" refers to an argument about a type of Tzara'as that is Tahor?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Yes! "Kulo Hafach Lavan Tahor Hu." (If Tzara'as spreads and covers the entire person, he is Tahor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is not called Tzara'as. It is Bohak (a Tahor paling of the skin).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, "Bein Nega l'Nega" must refer to Tzara'as of people, houses and garments. All are Teme'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Likewise, "Bein Dam l'Dam" refers to blood of Nidah, birth or Zivah. All are Teme'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Tzara'as, we can explain what they argue about:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Tzara'as of people, they argue as R. Yehoshua and Chachamim do:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Baheres (a white appearance on the skin) preceded the white hair, he is (absolutely) Tamei. If the white hair came first, he is Tahor (i.e. only Musgar);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If we are in Safek which came first, he is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Yehoshua says, Kehah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> It is as if the Tzara'as became weaker. He is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding Tzara'as of houses, they argue as R. Elazar bar Shimon and Chachamim do;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> A house is Tamei only if there are appearances (of Tzara'as) the size of a Gris on each of two stones that touch in the corner. (The appearances must touch each other.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Kir" and it also says "Kiros" refers to a wall that is like two walls, i.e. the corner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Regarding Tzara'as of garments, they argue as R. Nasan and Chachamim do:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nasan ben Avtulmus) Question:</span> What is the source that if Tzara'as spreads and covers the entire garment, it is Tahor?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says Karachas and Gabachas regarding people, and also regarding garments;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Just like when Tzara'as spreads and covers an entire person, he is Tahor, also regarding garments.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> If all blood were Tamei, what could they argue about?! (Yerushalmi, cited in Meromei Sadeh - it does not say "Bein Dam <i>v</i>'Dam," rather, "Bein Dam <i>l</i>'Dam," which connotes discernment between different appearances of blood.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that these colors are Tamei, and others are Tehorim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> "Va'Yir'u Mo'av... ha'Mayim Adumim ka'Dam" -teaches that blood is red.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that only the very reddest is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> It says "Dameha" (plural, teaching two), and again "Dameha," making four in all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> There are five Tamei colors.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> Black blood was red, just it was stricken.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Black is like Cheres. More Amuk than this is Tamei, and more Dehah is Tahor, even if it is blue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The blood is not black from the beginning. It becomes black after leaving the body.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OPINIONS ABOUT OTHER COLORS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Also the color of Meimei Tilsan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Beis Shamai not learn from "Dameha... Dameha"?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That is correct. (They learn two more colors from somewhere else.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Chanina taught that black blood was red, just it was stricken. Likewise, the extra colors of Beis Shamai are stricken forms of red (or another of the four colors).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Hillel):</span> These are Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana considers them Safek Tamei. Beis Hillel is Metaher them completely.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>YAROK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Akavya ben Mehalalel):</span> Yarok (we will call this yellow, like most Meforshim) is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Akavya not learn from "Dameha... Dameha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That is correct. (He learns another color from elsewhere).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Yellow is a stricken form of one of the four colors.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> It is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana holds that yellow is Safek Tamei. Chachamim hold that it is definitely Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> (Even) if a yellow Kesem is not Tamei, the blood is a liquid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Meir holds like Akavya, that yellow is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #1:</span> He told Chachamim: Granted, a yellow Kesem is not Tamei. (Since yellow blood is rare, we are not concerned lest it came from her. Tosfos - alternatively, yellow blood is Tamei only mid'Rabanan and the Rabbinic decree of Kesamim does not apply to it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, you should agree that when we know that yellow blood came from her, she is a Nidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a yellow Kesem is not Tamei, the blood is a liquid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Yochanan, it should say "(even) if a yellow Kesem is not Tamei, yellow blood is"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #2:</span> Rather, he told them: granted, if her first sighting of blood is yellow, it is (not Dam Nidah, it is) Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if she first saw red blood (she is a Nidah.) If she later sees yellow blood, the blood is Tamei like her urine and other bodily fluids!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, only fluids that accumulate before coming out (such as urine) are Teme'im, but not (Tahor colors of) blood, for it drips out right away!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Chachamim's logic is sound. R. Meir would not argue with it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #3:</span> Rather, R. Meir said 'you should agree that yellow blood is Machshir.' (If it touches food, the food can be Mekabel Tum'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim argue. We learn that blood is considered one of the seven liquids that are Machshir from "v'Dam Chalalim Yishteh." Her blood is not Dam Chalalim (of a corpse)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Meir would not argue with this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #4:</span> R. Meir learns from a Gezeirah Shavah. It says "Shelachayich Pardes Rimonim," and it says "v'Shole'ach Mayim Al Pnei Chutzos." The same blood that sends women from their husbands is equated to water. (It is Machshir. Tosfos ha'Rosh - since another source teaches that Dam Nidah is Machshir, the Gezeirah Shavah teaches that yellow blood is Machshir.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim argue. A Chacham can make a Kal va'Chomer by himself, but he cannot learn a Gezeirah Shavah without a tradition from Moshe from Sinai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> It is neither.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches that the first Tana is R. Yosi. One who says a Halachah in the name of its author brings redemption to the world.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>RED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Red is like blood of a wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is like blood of a slaughtered ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the Tana say 'like blood of Shechitah'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That would imply like any blood of Shechitah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>'Blood of a wound' connotes the first blood that exudes from the incision.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> It is like blood of a bird that is Chayah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he say "Chayah" to denote that it is alive, or that it is healthy?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Zeira):</span> It is like blood of a head louse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a woman killed a louse and later saw a Kesem, she may be Toleh on the louse (attribute the Kesem to its blood).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> She can attribute the blood to any louse, i.e. the blood of all lice is a Tamei shade of red!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, she may be Toleh only on a head louse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Ami Vardina'ah):</span> It is like the blood of the pinky if it was bruised, healed and bruised again;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It must be the smallest finger of a bachelor less than 20.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> She is Toleh on her son or husband (if he has a wound).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Her husband is not a bachelor, yet she can be Toleh on him! (This shows that his blood resembles Dam Nidah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The case is, her husband (is under 20, and) performed Chupah, but did not yet have Bi'ah with her. (Therefore, his blood still resembles Dam Nidah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Nachman):</span> It is like blood of bloodletting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Cases occurred in which R. Meir was Toleh on a bandage, and Rebbi was Toleh on sycamore sap.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They were Toleh red Kesamim on these. (This shows that they need not be so close to red. This is unlike all the Amora'im!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Kesamim were other colors.</p>
