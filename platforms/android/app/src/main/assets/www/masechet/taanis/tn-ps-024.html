<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE HARSHNESS OF R. YOSI FROM YUKRAS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Yosi bar Avin left R. Yosi from Yukras to study before R. Ashi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One day R. Yosi heard R. Ashi citing Shmuel that one who takes a fish from the sea on Shabbos has transgressed as soon as an area of its skin the size of a Sela has dried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi said that he should note that it is only if this area is between its fins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Ashi replied that that is the opinion of R. Yosi bar Avin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yosi bar Avin replied that he was that man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Ashi asked why he had left R. Yosi of Yukras, and he replied that someone who did not pity his son and daughter would not pity him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The incident with his son was that when he was delayed from bringing food to his workers, his son prayed that the tree should produce figs for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When his father, who had been delayed for a mitzvah, arrived, he said that since he caused the tree to give fruit in the wrong time, he should die before his time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The incident with his daughter was that he caught someone staring at her beauty.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He said that she should die rather than cause others to sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>When he hired out his donkey, it would return by itself with the exact rental on its back. If the hirer put on too much or too little, it refused to go.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once the hirer left a pair of shoes on its back, and it wouldn't move until he removed them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE CHARITABLE ELAZAR OF BIRTA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The charity-collectors would hide from Elazar of Birta as he would give them everything he had.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Once when he went to buy his daughter's wedding dress he noticed them and forced them to tell him what they were collecting for.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>When they said that it was for orphans, he said that they took precedence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>He gave them all his money except one Zuz, with which he bought wheat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>When his wife looked in their grain store, she saw that it was bursting with wheat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>When his daughter told him of the miracle, he said that it was all Hekdesh, and they were entitled to no more than a pauper would be.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ACTIONS THAT MERIT RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Yehudah the Nasi decreed a fast when there was no rain, but his prayers were not answered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He bemoaned that he was so much less than Shmuel haRamasi who was successful at this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He was disheartened, and then rain fell (because of his contrition).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Nasi once decreed a fast and only told R. Yochanan and Resh Lakish on that morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Resh Lakish was worried that they had not accepted it in advance, but R. Yochanan said that since the Nasi had decreed it, that was not necessary.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Nasi once decreed a fast, but no rain fell.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Oshiya the Younger noted that the Jewish people are like a bride; if her eyes (i.e. the leaders) are in bad shape, her whole body needs checking.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Nasi's servants began to throttle him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The townsfolk told them to leave him alone; he bothered them, too, but they ignored him, as he acted for the sake of Heaven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rebbi decreed a fast and was not answered, but the rain fell when Ilfa said so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His merit was that he made Kiddush and Havdalah for a town that could not afford wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav decreed a fast and was not answered, but the rain fell when the Shali'ach Tzibur said so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His merit was that he was a schoolteacher who would teach poor children together with wealthy ones, not taking money if they could not afford it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He would also bribe reluctant students into learning with fish from his pond.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Nachman decreed a fast but no rain fell. He said that he should be thrown off a wall, and was disheartened, and rain fell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rabah decreed a fast but was not answered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The people challenged him that R. Yehudah was successful at it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He replied that if it was due to study, his generation was superior, as they studied all six Sedarim and not just Nezikin.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Furthermore, R. Yehudah considered sections of Uktzin to be as difficult as the questions of Rav and Shmuel, whereas Rabah's group had studied it thirteen times.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Yet nevertheless, R. Yehudah could take off his shoe and rain would fall, whereas Rabah could pray all day unsuccessfully.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>He concluded that it was because the generation was less worthy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yehudah saw two people throwing bread, concluded that there was abundance, and caused an Ayin Hara which brought famine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His Shamash was told to persuade him to visit the market and see the famine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When he saw people crowding for food, he told his Shamash to remove his shoes to prepare to pray for rain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>As soon as he took off one shoe, rain fell.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>When he came to take off the other shoe, Eliyahu told him that Hash-m would destroy the world if he did so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MAKING USE OF MIRACLES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Mari saw Malachim in the guise of sailors filling their boat with sand, which turned into flour.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When people thronged to buy it, he told them not to, as it was the work of miracles.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The next day, a boat of grain arrived.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rava decreed a fast in Hegronia, but no rain fell, so he extended it overnight.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The next day he asked if anyone had had a dream; one person did have a dream which was a greeting from Above.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava interpreted this to mean that it was a fortuitous time to pray, and he was answered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A man, sentenced to lashes in Rava's court for having relations with a non-Jew, died in the process.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shavur Malka wanted to punish Rava, but his mother Ifra Hurmiz warned him not to mess with the Jews as Hash-m grants their wishes, such as when they request rain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He challenged them to produce rain in the height of summer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rava prayed, but no rain came. He pleaded that Hash-m should perform miracles as he did for their ancestors, and rain fell in torrents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rava's father appeared to him in a dream and told him that he was in trouble for having bothered Hash-m, and he should sleep elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The next day he found his bed scratched by knives.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>ACTIONS THAT MERIT RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Papa decreed a fast, but no rain came.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Feeling faint, he ate some porridge before praying again, and still no rain came.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Nachman teased him that he should eat some more porridge; he was embarrassed, and rain fell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Chanina b. Dosa was walking along when rain fell.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He said, "Everyone is benefiting, and I am in distress!?" and the rain stopped.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Arriving home, he said, "Everyone is in distress, and I am benefiting!?" and the rain continued.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> Compared to his prayers, those of the Kohen Gadol are worthless:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Kohen would pray that if the year is hot, it should be wet, and Hash-m should ignore the prayer of travelers that it should not rain.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The prayer would conclude that the rulership should not depart from Beis Yehudah, and that Yisrael should not need to rely on each other for sustenance.</p>
