<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could one support a pot with a door!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be amended to mean that a door may, similarly, not be supported by a block of wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that R. Shimon permits using a block of wood for these purposes.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>R. ELAZAR B.R. SHIMON PERMITS LEADING AN ANIMAL WITH A STICK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Elazar permit here in accordance with his father's opinion (that the stick is not Muktzah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Muktzah need not have been a factor with the stick, even for the Tana Kama whose prohibition may owe to its looking as if he is taking his animal to market to sell.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OTHER USES FOR A STICK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman):</span> One may not use a spit-shaped Chizra.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Sheshes):</span> It is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Their Machlokes applies to a stick which is fit for (burning) use since it is dry, but not if it is damp.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Nachman assumes wood to be forbidden, and permitted only for firewood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Sheshes that the permission to use the wood is unrestricted (no Muktzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Alternately, their Machlokes applies only if it is damp.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Nachman prohibits since it is not fit for use.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Sheshes permits since it could still be added to a large fire.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Halachah (according to those who maintain Muktzah- Rashi) rules that a dry Chizra is permitted, but a wet one is not.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>RAVA'S RULING IN ACCORDANCE WITH R. YEHUDAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One may not use an undesignated poker on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Also, a designated poker may not be burned as kindling if it broke.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rava permitted handling the innards of the bird (which R. Yehudah would presumably forbid since whatever is prepared for a person, is not fit for an animal) thus indicating that he does <i>not</i> hold of Muktzah in accordance with R. Yehudah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even R. Yehudah would permit handling those innards since he intends, even before Yom Tov, to cast them to the cat (since they rot).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH: MUKTZAH AND MOLID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> One may take a splinter of wood (from "before him" but meaning from the Chatzer- Rashi) to pick one's teeth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One may also collect splinters of wood scattered in the Chatzer, as they are Muchan, despite the effort entailed in gathering them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> One may collect only splinters which are before him (not out in the Chatzer) and may then only use them for kindling, not as a toothpick.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>One may not produce a fire in any manner on Yom Tov, nor may one heat roof-tiles to fry thereupon.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MUKTZAH AND TIKUN KLI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Animal food may be used freely (no Tikun Kli).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Kehana):</span> But the Beraisa rules that one would be Chayav for fashioning a Kli from Besamim, presumably even from those which are fit for animals!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may move Besamim for its fragrance and one may roll it in one's hand in order to bring out its smell.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One may not, however, break them to bring out their fragrance, lest he come to break them to fashion a toothpick (an Isur d'Oraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah):</span> The Beraisa is prohibiting hard wood, which is not fit for animal food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How then are they able to be rolled!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa must be amended to permit soft wood entirely (even to break a toothpick therefrom) and to prohibit hard wood, as above.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>USING THE ABOVE DISTINCTION TO RESOLVE TWO BERAISOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One Beraisa permits breaking the Besamim for their fragrance and one forbids it (lest he fashion a toothpick therefrom)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira citing R. Chisda):</span> Soft wood is permitted and hard wood (not fit for fodder) is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Acha b. Yaakov):</span> But, based on the Mishnah which permits breaking open a barrel haphazardly (without intending to fashion a Kli) to obtain its contents, it should be permitted to break the Besamim for its fragrance (and we do not restrict him lest he fashion a Kli with intent)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Further Question:</span> It was reported that R. Yehudah did so himself!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (for the second question):</span> R. Eliezer (who holds in the cited Beraisa that breaking a splinter off a large piece of wood involves a d'Oraisa) prohibits, while R. Yehudah rules like the Rabanan (who hold, in the cited Beraisa, that such splintering is not Tikun Kli d'Oraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that R. Eliezer <i>permits</i> breaking open a vessel (provided that one does not intend to make a Kli)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Answer (to this and to the first question above) [R. Ashi]: That Beraisa is speaking of Mosteki, a broken barrel whose pieces are stuck together with resin.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>GATHERING WOOD FROM THE CHATZER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> One may not gather the wood and pile it into a heap.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> One may even make a heap.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the basis for their argument?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Whether it appears as though he is collecting for future, post-Yom Tov use (Rabanan) or whether it will be assumed that his cooking requires it (R. Shimon).</p></div>
