<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A RAPIST MUST MARRY THE GIRL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When is a rapist forced to marry her? (... If she is forbidden to Yisraelim, he may not keep her.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> The Mitzvas Aseh to marry her should override the Lav!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Zvid of Nehardai):</span> An Aseh overrides a Lav only in cases such as cutting off Tzara'as during circumcision, since there is no other way to fulfill the Aseh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Here, if she says that she does not want to marry him, there is no longer an Aseh!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A GIRL WHO WAS DIVORCED FROM EIRUSIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> If an orphaned girl was divorced from Eirusin, one who rapes her must pay. One who seduces her is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> R. Elazar holds like his Rebbi, R. Akiva, who says that there is a fine for a girl divorced from Eirusin (even if her father is alive), and she receives it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar did not need to teach that one who seduces an orphan is exempt. (She pardoned him!) Rather, he teaches that a Na'arah divorced from Eirusin is like an orphan, i.e. she receives the fine herself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The Halachah follows R. Elazar. He is the happiest of the Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>EMBARRASSMENT AND BLEMISH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Embarrassment is evaluated according to the one who embarrassed and the one who was embarrassed;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>To evaluate blemish, we appraise how much less one would pay to buy her to be a slave (because she is not a virgin);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The fine is the same for all;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Anything fixed by the Torah is the same for all people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We should say that the 50 Sela'im (Shekalim) that the Torah specified is the full compensation!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> If so, people would say that the fine for a king's daughter is the same like the fine for a commoner!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> People can say this about the fine for a Mu'ad animal that kills a slave! One pays 30 Shekalim for a slave who can string pearls (a very lucrative profession), like for a slave who only sews!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">40b----------------------------------------40b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Zeira):</span> If two men had Bi'ah with her, one Lo k'Darkah (in the anus, so she is still a Besulah) and one k'Darkah (normally), people will say that the same 50 Shekalim are paid for a full virgin as for a blemished girl! (Therefore, he must pay also for embarrassment and blemish.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> People can say so about the fine for a slave. One pays 30 Shekalim for a healthy slave, like for a leprous slave!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> "For having afflicted her" connotes that he pays also for embarrassment and blemish.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> "The man who lied with her..." - 50 Shekalim is for the pleasure of lying with her. This implies that he pays also embarrassment and blemish.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps she receives these payments!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Bi'N'ureha Beis Aviha" - all revenue of a Na'arah goes to her father.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, why did Rav learn from elsewhere that her father gets her earnings?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "If a man will sell his daughter to be a slave" - just like the earnings of a slave belong to her master, so the earnings of a daughter belong to her father.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, we must say that "Bi'N'ureha Beis Aviha" teaches only about vows.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> Perhaps we can learn embarrassment and blemish from vows!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We do not learn monetary laws from Isurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> Perhaps we can learn from the fine!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We do not learn Mamon (payments according to the damage) from fines.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is logical that these payments go to the father, since he could have received much Kidushin money for her from a disgusting person or leper (who has difficulty finding one who will marry him. The father cannot receive so much for a non-virgin, so he should receive the compensation.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We evaluate blemish as if she was a slave being sold.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we evaluate this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel's father):</span> We evaluate the difference between what one would pay for a virgin slave from a non-virgin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One buys a slave for work. Why does he care whether or not she is a virgin?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He wants to marry her to his slave.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make to the owner?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He likes the slave, and wants to give him a virgin.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>A FINE FOR MINORS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Whenever a man can sell his daughter to be to be a slave, i.e. before she is a Na'arah, there is no fine for her. Whenever there is a fine for her, i.e. while she is a Na'arah, he cannot sell her;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A Bogeres cannot be sold and has no fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Meir. Chachamim say that there is a fine for a girl who can be sold.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> From the day a girl is born until she becomes a Na'arah, she may be sold, but has no fine. When she brings two hairs (and becomes a Na'arah), she has a fine but cannot be sold;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say that a girl has a fine from three years until Bagrus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does she have a fine but she cannot be sold?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, she has a fine even though she can be sold (before Na'arus).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> R. Meir learns from "To him she will be a wife" - the verse discusses one who could marry herself off (if she had no father, i.e. a Na'arah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rav Papa brei d'Rav Chanan - (Reish Lakish):</span> The Chachamim learn that when the Torah says "Na'arah", this includes a minor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> Reish Lakish said this about Motzi Shem Ra (a Chasan who claims that he found that his Kalah was not a virgin):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> One who is Motzi Shem Ra about a minor is exempt - "He will give to the father of the <i>Na'arah</i> (spelled full, with a <i>Hei</i>)" - the Torah discusses a full (proper) Na'arah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> Even without the Hei, we would know that a minor is not included!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"The Na'arah... will be stoned" - we do not punish a minor!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here we know that the verse discusses a full Na'arah. We infer that whenever Na'arah is spelled deficiently, it includes even a minor.</p></div>
