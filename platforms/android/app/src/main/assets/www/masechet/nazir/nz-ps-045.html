<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN <i>TAHARAH</i> IS COMPLETE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, you should similarly expound "(A Tamei Nazir will bring Korbanos) to Pesach Ohel Mo'ed" - he may come only after Tevilah and ha'Arev Shemesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This cannot be! (Lifnei Hash-m refers to the Nikanor gate.) Sha'ar Nikanor is in Machaneh Levi (a level of Kedushah permitted to a Tamei Nazir even before Taharah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Tamei Mes may enter Machaneh Levi. Even a Mes itself may be brought there!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Moshe took the bones of Yosef with him" - in his camp, Machaneh Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi):</span> Answer (Rav Nasan's colleagues): Indeed, a Zav who is a Tvul Yom is like a Zav. A Tamei Nazir who is a Tvul Yom cannot enter the Levite camp because he is Mechusar Kipurim (has not brought his Korbanos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos, Rosh) Answer (Abaye):</span> Rather, a Zav who is a Tvul Yom is not like a Zav. Nevertheless, since he is Mechusar Kipurim, he may not enter. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the verse discusses entering Machaneh Levi, why is it called Pesach Ohel Mo'ed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that just like a Mechusar Kipurim may not approach the Ohel Mo'ed, he may not enter Machaneh Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Mechusar Kipurim may not approach the Ohel Mo'ed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "He will be Tamei" includes a Tvul Yom. "His Tum'ah is still in him" includes a Mechusar Kipurim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>GILU'ACH OF A TAHOR NAZIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Upon finishing Nezirus in Taharah, the Nazir brings three animals - a Chatas, an Olah, and a Shelamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, he slaughters the Shelamim and shaves;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Elazar says, he shaves after the Chatas, for the Chatas is always offered first;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he shaved after any of the Korbanos was slaughtered, he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if he brought three animals and did not specify, the one Kosher for the Chatas (the female lamb) is offered for the Chatas. The male lamb will be the Olah, and the ram will be the Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "(The Nazir) will shave Pesach Ohel Mo'ed" - this means after the Shelamim, about which it says "he will slaughter it Pesach Ohel Mo'ed."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it means that he should shave at the Pesach Ohel Mo'ed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> That would be a disgrace!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi) (R. Oshaya):</span> We need not rely on our own reasoning. The Torah says "do not walk up steps to my Mizbe'ach (because one's posture is not so modest when going up stairs)." All the more so, the Torah forbids disgrace!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos' text) Question:</span> That is not sufficient reason to alter the simple meaning of the verse!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah says "do not walk up steps to my Mizbe'ach." All the more so, the Torah forbids disgrace! (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (R. Yitzchak):</span> We know that the simple meaning cannot be true without this! It says "he will take his hair and put it on the fire (under the pot with the Shelamim)" - he must shave in a place where he can immediately put his hair on the fire;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he would shave Pesach Ohel Mo'ed, he would then need to bring it to where the Shelamim is cooking! (We follow Hagahos ha'Gra, which deletes the second version.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Aba Chanan):</span> The Nazir will shave Pesach Ohel Mo'ed." He may shave only when the Ohel Mo'ed is Pasu'ach (open).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon Shezuri):</span> A (male) Nazir shaves Pesach Ohel Mo'ed, but a (female) Nezirah does not, lest this arouse young Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "He will stand her (a Sotah) in front of Hash-m", and we are not concerned about arousing young Kohanim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Nezirah beautifies herself. A Sotah does not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CASTING THE HAIR UNDER THE FIRE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He takes the shaven hair and casts it under the pot. If he shaves outside the Mikdash, he does not cast it under the pot;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This applies when a Tahor Nazir shaves. When a Tamei Nazir shaves, he does not cast the hair under the pot;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, all cast the hair under the pot except for a Tamei Nazir who shaved outside the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> After taking his hair, he takes gravy (of the Korban) and pours it on the hair and casts it under the pot in which the Shelamim is being cooked;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he cast it under the Chatas or Asham, he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Tahor Nazir does not bring an Asham!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If a Tamei Nazir casts the hair under the Asham, he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that he casts the hair with the gravy?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "That is under Zevach (Korban) ha'Shelamim" - some of the Zevach must be underneath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he casts it under the Chatas or Asham, why was he Yotzei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Zevach" includes the Chatas or Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We already expounded "Zevach" to teach about the gravy!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah wanted to teach only that law, it would have said 'gravy of the Shelamim.' Rather, it says "Zevach" to teach that one is Yotzei with the Chatas or Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it comes only for this latter law!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it would have said 'Shelamim or Zevach.' Rather, it says "Zevach ha'Shelamim" to teach both laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> All cast the hair under the pot except for a Tamei Nazir who shaved outside the Mikdash, because his hair must be buried;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Yehudah says, a Tahor Nazir casts his hair, no matter where he shaved. A Tamei Nazir never casts his hair;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Chachamim say, only a Tahor Nazir who shaved in the Mikdash casts his hair, for this is the Mitzvah l'Chatchilah.</p>
