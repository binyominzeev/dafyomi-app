<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rebbi taught to his son R. Shimon 'Others say, if it (an animal called 'Ma'aser' by mistake) were a Temurah, it would not be offered. (Since it is offered, this shows that it is not Temurah)!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> If we learn the Torah of these Chachamim, why don't we mention their names?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> He tried to uproot the Nesi'us from our family!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> "... Gam Sinasam, Gam Kinasam Kevar Avadah" (what was, was)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> "Ha'Oyev Tamu, Charavos Lanetzach (the enemy died, but his swords persist forever)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> That is only if his actions accomplished something!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> They said in R. Meir's name, if it was a Temurah, it would not be offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Even Rebbi, who was exceedingly humble, did not explicitly teach it in R. Meir's name (i.e. R. Meir says...)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE GREATEST ATTRIBUTES OF A CHACHAM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel and Chachamim argued about which is preferable, Sinai (one who knows all the Mishnayos and Beraisos, like they were given on Sinai), or one who can uproot mountains (through his sharp power of reasoning).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yosef was Sinai, and Rabah uprooted mountains. They asked Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael which takes precedence.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael:</span> Sinai comes first. All need the bearer of wheat (Mishnayos and Beraisos are the source of all Halachah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Even so, Rav Yosef did not accept to be the Nasi (in Pumbadisa, after Rav Yehudah died) before Rabah. Rabah was the Nasi for 22 years. He died, and Rav Yosef became Nasi.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>During the 22 years, Rav Yosef would not call a bloodletter to his house (to avoid any conduct of authority. Ramah - he had no need for any doctors. This was a reward for lowering himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>After Rav Yosef died, Abaye, Rava, R. Zeira and Rabah bar Masnah had to decide which of them would be the next Nasi. They decided that whoever will say a teaching that the others cannot refute, he will be Nasi. Only Abaye's teaching was not refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Of R. Zeira and Rabah bar Masnah, which had precedence?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Zeira would ask sharply. Rabah bar Masnah would deliberate and conclude according to the Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This question is unsettled.</p>
