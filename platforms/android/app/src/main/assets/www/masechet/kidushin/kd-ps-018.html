<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>INHERITANCE OF A NOCHRI (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> "I gave Mount Se'ir as an inheritance to Esav" teaches that mid'Oraisa, a Nochri inherits his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That proof is inconclusive. Perhaps a Yisrael Mumar inherits, but a Nochri does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, we learn from "I gave Ar for an inheritance to the descendants of Lot".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Chiya bar Avin not learn like Rava?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It does not say 'he will calculate with the one who bought him, not with the buyer's heirs.' (Perhaps the buyer has no heirs!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Rava not learn like R. Chiya bar Avin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps a Nochri normally does not inherit. Hash-m made Lot an exception, due to the honor of Avraham.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE SLAVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Some things apply only to a (male) Eved Ivri, and others apply only to an Amah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An Eved Ivri leaves after six years, in Yovel, or when the master dies. This is not true about an Amah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>An Amah leaves when she brings Simanim, and she cannot be sold more than once, and we redeem her against his will. These are not true about an Eved Ivri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> In addition to what frees a male slave, an Amah goes free also when she brings Simanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> Our Beraisa says that what frees a male slave does not free an Amah. It discusses when Yi'ud was done (the master married her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, obviously she does not go out like a male slave. She needs a Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that her initial status (that she leaves after six years or Yovel) remains. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Yi'ud was done, she does not go out through Simanim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa teaches that if Yi'ud was not done, she goes out also through Simanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> She cannot be sold more than once...(these are not true about a male slave).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A male slave can be resold!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> "(He will be sold) for his theft" - and not to pay the double (extra) payment that a thief must pay, nor for the fine that Edim Zomemim (witnesses who testified about what they were not present to see) pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"For his theft" - once he is sold, you cannot sell him again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer #1 (Rava):</span> He can be sold only once to pay for one theft, but can be resold to pay for more thefts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> "For his theft" can include more than one theft!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Rather, he can be sold only once for thefts in one sentencing, but he can be resold if he is judged another time for theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer #1 (Rava):</span> He can be resold to pay for one theft, but not to pay for more than one theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> "For his theft" connotes all thefts (from one person)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Rather, he can be resold only for thefts from one person, but not for thefts from others. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he stole 1000, and he is worth 500 (to be sold for a slave), he is sold twice. If he stole 500, and he is worth 1000, he is not sold at all;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>R. Eliezer says, if he stole his value, he is sold. If not, he is not sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Eliezer can refute the Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that if he stole 500, and he is worth 1000, he is not sold at all. This is because he must be sold entirely to pay for his theft, not half sold;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also if he stole 1000, and he is worth 500, he must be sold for all his theft, not for half of it!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN AN AMAH BE SOLD AGAIN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We redeem her against his will.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This means against the master's will.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Do you hold that we force the master to free her, even though he only receives a document in which she obligates herself to pay her redemption when she will get the money?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is absurd that we would force someone holding a pearl (something valuable, an Amah) to give it up for a (currently) worthless shard (the document)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Rather, we force her father to redeem her (if he has the money), due to disgrace to the family.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should also force an Eved Ivri's relatives to redeem him for this reason!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This will not help. He will sell himself again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Likewise, if we force an Amah's father to redeem her, he will sell her again!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Shimon (who holds that he cannot resell her).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A man can Mekadesh his daughter, and (after she is widowed or divorced) Mekadesh her again. He can sell her to be a slave, and (after she goes free) resell her. He can Mekadesh her after selling her; but he cannot sell her after he was Mekadesh her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, just like he cannot sell her after he was Mekadesh her, he cannot sell her after selling her once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>These Tana'im argue like the following Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "B'Vigdo Vah" - once he (her master) spread his Beged (cloak) over her (for Yi'ud), her father cannot sell her (this is like Chachamim);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar says, "B'Vagdo Vah" - once he (her father) Bagad (betrayed her, by selling her), he cannot sell her (again, like R. Shimon. This is like Rashi. Tosfos switches the opinions of R. Akiva and R. Eliezer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer holds that (when a word in the Torah is pronounced unlike it is written) we primarily follow the way it is written. R. Akiva holds that we follow the way it is pronounced. R. Shimon holds that we follow both (therefore, she cannot be sold after Kidushin or after being sold).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>YI'UD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Avuha):</span> Does Yi'ud make Kidushin or Nisu'in?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This determines whether the master inherits her and becomes Tamei to engage in her burial, and whether he can annul her vows by himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> "B'Vigdo Vah" - once he spread his cloak over her, her father cannot sell her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He cannot sell her, but he can be Mekadesh her!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Yi'ud makes Nisu'in, once she had Nisu'in, her father has no jurisdiction over her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rather, Yi'ud makes only Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> No, the Beraisa discusses regular Kidushin. It means that once her father handed her over to someone obligated to feed her, clothe her and fulfill Onah (Bi'ah at regular intervals, i.e. he was Mekadesh her), her father cannot sell her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> A man cannot sell his daughter to relatives;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer says, he can.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Both agree that one can sell (his daughter, even if she is) a widow to a Kohen Gadol, or a divorcee or Chalutzah to a regular Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did she become a widow (while a minor)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she was Mekadesh herself, she would not be called a widow (her Kidushin was void)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, her father was Mekadesh her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One cannot sell his daughter after he was Mekadesh her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Amram):</span> She became a widow through Yi'ud, according to Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, who says that the money paid for an Amah was not given for Kidushin. (Therefore, it is as if her father was not Mekadesh her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Yi'ud makes Nisu'in, after Nisu'in her father has no jurisdiction over her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is difficult even if we say that Yi'ud makes Kidushin! The Beraisa says that both agree that he can sell her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One cannot sell his daughter after he was Mekadesh her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must distinguish. A man cannot sell his daughter after he was Mekadesh her, but he can sell her after she was Mekadesh herself (through Yi'ud)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can likewise distinguish, and say that a girl leaves her father's jurisdiction after he married her off (Nisu'in), but not after she married herself off (through Yi'ud, if Yi'ud makes Nisu'in)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This reasoning is wrong! We can distinguish when he is Mekadesh her from when she is Mekadesh herself, but there cannot be a distinction in Nisu'in (since Nisu'in is entering the husband's Reshus. Perforce, she leaves the father's jurisdiction.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak holds that even Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah agrees that the money paid for an Amah was given for Kidushin (if the master will do Yi'ud). How can he explain the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Eliezer (Rashi; Tosfos - R. Akiva), who says that a man cannot sell his daughter twice, but he can sell her after he was Mekadesh her.</p>
