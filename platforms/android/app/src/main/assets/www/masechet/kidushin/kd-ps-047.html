<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MUTIPLE ACTS OF KIDUSHIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> (The Mishnah says that if she was eating them, she is Mekudeshes only if one was worth a Perutah by itself). This is only if he said '(be Mekudeshes to me) with this, and with this, and with this';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'with these', even if she was eating them, she is Mekudeshes as long as the combined value is at least a Perutah. She eats her own dates (that she received for Kidushin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one said 'be Mekudeshes to me with an acorn, with a pomegranate, and with a nut', or he said 'be Mekudeshes to me with these', if the total value is at least a Perutah, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'with this, and with this, and with this', if the sum value is at least a Perutah, she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'with this', and she took it and ate it, 'with this', and she took it and ate it, 'and also with this, and also with this', she is Mekudeshes only if one was worth a Perutah by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of 'with an acorn, with a pomegranate, and with a nut'?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He said to her 'or with an acorn, or with a pomegranate, or with a nut'.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, she would be Mekudeshes only if one is worth a Perutah by itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he said 'with an acorn and with a pomegranate, and with a nut'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, that is the same as 'with this, and with this, and with this'! (The Mishnah would not teach both cases.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he said 'with these'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The second clause teaches 'with these'. This implies that the Reisha is not this case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The second clause explains the first. 'Be Mekudeshes to me with an acorn, with a pomegranate, with a nut' means that he said 'with these';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Seifa teaches 'if she was eating them, she is Mekudeshes only if one was worth a Perutah by itself.' The Reisha (when he said 'with these') did not distinguish between eating them and storing them. (This is like Rava.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This is like the opinion that the Seifa of the Mishnah (when she was eating them) refers to the second clause (when he said 'with this, and with this, and with this');</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'She is Mekudeshes only if one was worth a Perutah by itself' refers to the last one;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav and Shmuel say that the Seifa of the Mishnah refers to the first clause (when he said 'be Mekudeshes to me with this, be Mekudeshes to me with this'). The Mishnah teaches that even when she eats them, one must be worth a Perutah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do they explain our Beraisa? Every clause in the Beraisa deals with one encompassing Kidushin! (Why must one be worth a Perutah by itself?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi says that whether one says '(tomorrow, I will eat from the Korban) k'Zayis (an olive's worth, and I will eat) k'Zayis (outside the permitted place)', or 'k'Zayis and k'Zayis' these are separate statements (regarding disqualifying the Korban due to Pigul). Our Beraisa is like Rebbi. (Whether one says 'with this, with this' or 'with this, and with this' these are separate acts of Kidushin.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KIDUSHIN WITH A LOAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a man was Mekadesh a woman with money he previously lent to her, she is not Mekudeshes, for a loan is given to be spent. (She already acquired the money, and merely needed to repay the loan. He merely pardons her debt, he does not give her anything new.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about Rav's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man was Mekadesh a woman with a loan, she is not Mekudeshes. Some say, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The first Tana holds that a loan is given to be spent. The first Tana says that it is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Seifa):</span> All agree that this acquires regarding a sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a loan is given to be spent, how can it acquire?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Huna):</span> No, the Beraisa is when he said that he is Mekadesh her with 100 Dinarim, and he gave only 99.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana says that she is not Mekudeshes, for she is ashamed to ask for the last Dinar (so she does not agree to 99);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The latter Tana says that she is not ashamed to ask for the last Dinar (so she accepts 99, expecting to get the last one later).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If so, Tana'im argue about R. Elazar's law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If one said 'be Mekudeshes to me with 100 Dinarim', and he gave to her one Dinar, she is Mekudeshes, and he must pay the rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Tana'im argue about whether she is ashamed to ask for the last of 100 Dinarim. All agree that she is not ashamed when he owes 99 of the 100.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one said 'be Mekudeshes to me with the deposit I left with you', and she went and found that it was stolen or lost, she is Mekudeshes only if a Perutah of it remained;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding a loan, she is Mekudeshes even if a Perutah does not remain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, a loan has the same law as a deposit.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Tana'im argue about whether a Perutah must remain from the loan, but all agree that she is Mekudeshes through a loan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This Beraisa is erroneous! How can we explain the case of a deposit?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she accepted responsibility for it (she owes him, for it was lost), this is just like when she owes him a loan!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she did not accept responsibility, why does the Seifa discuss a loan? It should distinguish within the case of a deposit, and teach that sometimes she is Mekudeshes (when she accepted responsibility), even when nothing remained!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> One must correct the Beraisa to say 'regarding a loan, she is not Mekudeshes even if a Perutah remains. R. Shimon ben Elazar says, a loan is like a deposit.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabanan):</span> They argue about whether a lender may take back a loan before the borrower spent any of it. They similarly argue about who loses if the money was lost before any was spent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rabah):</span> No. All agree that the borrower pays if the money is lost, even before any was spent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When one borrows an object, he must return the same object. If it is lost (even through Ones), he pays for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When one borrows money, he need not return the same coins. All the more so, if the coins are lost, he must pay (since the lost coins did not belong to the lender)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> They argue (only) about whether or not a lender may take back a loan before the borrower spent any of it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Huna taught that if one borrowed an axe, once he chops with it, he acquires it (to use it for the promised time). Before chopping, he did not acquire it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Tana'im argue about Rav Huna's law!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. They argue only about money, for one who borrows money need not return the same coins;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who borrows an object must return the same object. All agree that before using it, the lender may retract.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>KIDUSHIN THROUGH A DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The following Tana'im argue about whether or not a loan can be Mekadesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Meir):</span> If one said 'be Mekudeshes to me through this loan document', or he authorized her to collect a debt that others owe to him, she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of the loan document?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is for a loan that others owe to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is the next case, a debt owed to him by others!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is for a debt that she owes to him. They argue about whether or not one can be Mekadesh a woman with money that she owes him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, the document is for a loan that others owe to him. They argue both about a loan with a document, and a Milveh Al Peh (a loan for which no document was written).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding a loan with a document, what do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue like Rebbi and Chachamim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> One acquires a document when it is handed to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he acquires it only if the giver also writes a second document to transfer ownership of the first document.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(In Beraisa #1, he gave the document to her, without writing a second document.) R. Meir holds like Rebbi, and R. Meir's Chachamim (those who argue with him) hold like Rebbi's Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Meir and his Chachamim all hold like Rebbi. They argue about Rav Papa's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If one sells a document, he must write (or say) 'acquire it, and all the liens it has.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir does not hold like Rav Papa. Chachamim hold like Rav Papa.</p>
