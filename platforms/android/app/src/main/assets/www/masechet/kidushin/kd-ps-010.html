<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW EVERYONE EXPOUNDS THE VERSE ABOUT DEATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Rebbi argues only about the death penalty, but he agrees that if she was single, all the men pay the fine for raping or seducing an unmarried virgin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the Halachah different regarding the fine than regarding the death penalty?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding death, it says "the man who lied with her will die alone" (i.e. only the first man is stoned).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from "alone"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They expound like R. Yonasan:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Oshaya):</span> "Both of them will die" only if they are both fitting to be executed (i.e. both are adults);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yonasan says, "the man who lied with her will die alone"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yochanan learn Rebbi's law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah should have written 'That had Bi'ah with a man'; by writing "with a husband", it allows us to learn another law.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KIDUSHIN THROUGH BI'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the beginning of Bi'ah Mekadesh, or the end?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This affects a woman who received Kidushin money from Shimon while having Bi'ah (to make Kidushin) with Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, this affects a Kohen Gadol who is Mekadesh a virgin with Bi'ah. (If he does not acquire her until the end of Bi'ah, she is no longer a virgin, and she is forbidden to him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> Anyone who has Bi'ah intends for a full act of Bi'ah (he acquires at the end).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Bi'ah make Kidushin, or Nisu'in?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it makes Nisu'in, her husband inherits her, becomes Tamei to engage in her burial (even) if he a Kohen, and can annul her vows (alone);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she is only Mekudeshes, the above do not apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> A man has the right to be Mekadesh his (minor) daughter to another man, through taking money (and he keeps the money), a document, or Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He receives Metzi'os (Hefker objects) that she finds, and her earnings;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He can annul her vows;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If her husband divorces her during Erusin, he (her father) receives the Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He does not eat the Peros (yield) of her property in her lifetime.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If she makes Nisu'in, her husband (gets privileges 1 and 2, and) additionally receives the Peros of her property in her lifetime.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Beraisa teaches about Kidushin through Bi'ah, and later mentions Nisu'in. This shows that Bi'ah is only Mekadesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Marriage is mentioned regarding Kidushin through money or a document, but Bi'ah itself makes Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava - Mishnah):</span> A girl three years old and one day can be Mekudeshes with Bi'ah. If she falls to Yibum, her Yavam acquires her through Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A stranger who has Bi'ah with her is liable for Bi'ah with a married woman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who has Bi'ah with her when she is Nidah becomes Tamei, and then he is Metamei (light) Tum'ah to all mattresses below him;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If she marries a Kohen, she may eat Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If any Ervah (relative) punishable by death has Bi'ah with her, he is killed, and she is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If she has Bi'ah with anyone forbidden to her, she is disqualified from Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Mishnah teaches Kidushin through Bi'ah, and later mentions Nisu'in. This shows that Bi'ah is only Mekadesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Mishnah teaches that if her Nisu'in is to a Kohen, she eats Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A KOHEN'S WIFE EATS TERUMAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa - R. Yochanan ben Bag Bag, to Rebbi Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> I heard that you permit a Bas Yisrael Mekudeshes to a Kohen to eat Terumah. Is this true?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi Yehudah ben Beseira:</span> do not you agree that a Kal va'Chomer permits?! If a Kohen has Bi'ah with a Shifchah (Kena'anis, to try to acquire her), she does not eat Terumah. If he acquires her through money, she eats;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he acquires a Bas Yisrael through Bi'ah, she eats Terumah. All the more so, if he acquires her through money, she should eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, Chachamim decreed that she does not eat until Chupah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In which case did Rebbi Yehudah say that mid'Oraisa she eats Terumah if he acquired her through Bi'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If after he acquired her through Bi'ah (or money) she had Chupah, she eats even mid'Rabanan (there is no decree)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, she eats after Bi'ah with Chupah, but not after money without Chupah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Kal va'Chomer is invalid! Regarding Bi'ah, she eats after two Kinyanim. Regarding money, there was only one Kinyan!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it refers to Bi'ah (or money) without Chupah</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Bi'ah makes Nisu'in, we understand why it is more obvious that she eats after Bi'ah than after money.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Culmination of Answer (a):</span> If Bi'ah made only Kidushin, it would not be more obvious that she eats after Bi'ah than after money?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Really, Rebbi Yehudah discusses Bi'ah with Chupah, and money without Chupah. Even though regarding Bi'ah there were two acquisitions, and regarding money there was only one, the Kal va'Chomer is valid (like we explain):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bi'ah with a Shifchah does not permit her to eat Terumah, even if she had Chupah. If he acquired her through money, she eats without Chupah</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he acquired a Bas Yisrael through Bi'ah and Chupah, she eats Terumah. All the more so, if he acquires her through money alone, she should eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>However, Chachamim decreed that she does not eat until Chupah, due to Ula's concern (lest she share her Terumah with her siblings).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Ben Bag Bag rejects the Kal va'Chomer. Money fully acquires a Shifchah, but Kidushei Kesef does not fully acquire. Chupah is needed to complete the Kinyan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Ben Bag Bag knew that that mid'Oraisa, she eats. He had heard that Rebbi Yehudah ben Beseira permits her even mid'Rabanan. This was the dialogue:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ben Bag Bag:</span> Do you permit a Bas Yisrael Arusah to a Kohen to eat, without concern lest a blemish be found in her that would disqualify the Kidushin?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi Yehudah ben Beseira:</span> Yes, a Kal va'Chomer teaches this:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the Kohen had Bi'ah with a Shifchah, she does not eat Terumah. If he acquired her through money, she eats, and we are not concerned for a blemish;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he acquired a Bas Yisrael through Bi'ah, she eats Terumah. All the more so, if he acquired her through money alone, she should eat, without concern for a blemish!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>However, Chachamim decreed that she does not eat until Chupah, due to Ula's concern (lest she share her Terumah with her siblings, who may not eat it).</p>
