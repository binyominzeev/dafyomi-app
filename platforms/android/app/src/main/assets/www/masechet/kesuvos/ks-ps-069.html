<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ARE PARNASAH AND FOOD COLLECTED FROM SOLD PROPERTY?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav):</span> If brothers diverted the property to others, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Chiya was present when this question was delivered (to Rebbi).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya):</span> Does he mean that they sold the property, or that they gave it for collateral?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (Rebbi):</span> It makes no difference. In either case, daughters can collect Parnasah from it, but not food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav specify whether they sold it, or gave it for collateral?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav wanted to know about both:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had he asked about when they sold it, and Rebbi would answer that daughters collect it, Rav would know that all the more so, if they gave it for collateral;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>However, if Rebbi would answer that it is not collected, Rav would not know about when they gave it for collateral.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had he asked about when they gave it for collateral, and Rebbi would answer that daughters do not collect it, Rav would know that all the more so, if they sold it;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>However, if Rebbi would answer that it is collected, Rav would not know about when they sold it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Therefore, he worded his question in a way that includes both.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We do not collect for food or Parnasah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Yochanan not hear Rebbi's ruling, but had he heard it, he would have retracted his own ruling?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Or, R. Yochanan heard it, but nevertheless he argued?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The following shows that he had heard it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A man died, leaving two daughters and a son. One daughter took Parnasah. If the son died before the other daughter received Parnasah, she pardoned her Parnasah (and splits the remaining property with her sister);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Chanina):</span> A bigger Chidush was taught, that we take (sold property to pay) Parnasah, but not for food. How can you say that she pardoned it?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If R. Yochanan had not heard Rebbi's ruling, he should have asked 'Who says that Parnasah is taken from sold property (since R. Yochanan himself argues)!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Yochanan had not heard it (when he taught (e) above), but he heard it later, before R. Chanina challenged him. Even though R. Yochanan accepted the ruling, he argued with R. Chanina <i>in this case</i>, where the second daughter receives much property anyway (therefore she forfeits Parnasah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yemar):</span> According to R. Yochanan, if a girl has money because she found a Metzi'ah, does she pardon Parnasah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> No. R. Yochanan says so only when she receives a large share <i>of the estate</i>.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PARNASAH IS LIKE A DEBT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> A daughter who receives Parnasah is considered an heir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If so, the sons cannot force her to accept money (if she wants a tenth of the land)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> Correct!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If the sons want her to take the land in one place, can she demand a tenth of each piece of land?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> She can!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> She is like a creditor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Ameimar subsequently retracted, and agreed to Rav Ashi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Minyomi):</span> A woman came in front of Ameimar claiming Parnasah. The brothers said 'If we had money, we could force you to take it instead of the land', and Ameimar was silent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This shows that Ameimar agrees that they could force her to accept money.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is she like a creditor of the father, or of the brothers?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If she is a creditor of the brothers she collects middle quality land, without an oath (like a regular lender collects from the borrower);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If she is a creditor of the father, she collects low quality land, with an oath (like a lender collects from heirs of the borrower).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The following episode proves that she is a creditor of the brothers:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Ravina authorized Rav Ashi's daughter to collect middle quality land from her brother, without an oath.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>She also collected low quality land from the son of a deceased brother, with an oath (since she was a creditor of the deceased brother, and was collecting from his heir).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Rav Nechemyah sent to Rabah bar Rav Huna to collect Parnasah for a certain woman, even from the base of a millstone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> In Rav Kahana's academy, we used to collect for women even from rental of houses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Rav Anan sent to Rav Huna 'Huna our colleague, Shalom! When this woman comes before you, collect a tenth of the estate for her.' (This was not a proper way to address Rav Huna. Even Shmuel put Rav Huna before himself!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Huna (to Rav Sheshes):</span> Say the following to Rav Anan verbatim! If not, you will be excommunicated!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>'Anan, Anan! From land, or from Metaltelim? Also, who sits at the head in the house of Marzicha?'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rav Sheshes delivered the message verbatim, but first apologized to Rav Anan. 'You are greater than me; Rav Huna is greater than you. He said I will be in Cherem if I do not give this message. Otherwise, I would not say it! Anan, Anan...'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Anan (to Mar Ukva):</span> Do you see how he treated me? Also - what is Marzicha?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">69b----------------------------------------69b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Mar Ukva asked to hear the full story. Rav Anan explained.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Mar Ukva:</span> You do not know what Marzicha is, and you called Rav Huna 'Huna, our <i>colleague'</i>?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Marzicha?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a mourner - "Do not come to a house of Marzach."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Avahu):</span> How do we know that a mourner sits at the head?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu):</span> "V'Eshev Rosh...ka'Asher Avelim Yenachem"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yenachem connotes consoling others (the consoler is at the head)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is written (so we can read it) "Yinachem" (will be consoled. The verse could have said "Menachem' (console), which cannot be read any other way - Tosfos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar Zutra):</span> "V'Sar Mirzach Seruchim" - a mourner becomes a Sar (leader) to great people (who come to console him).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is, the following are taken only from land, not from Metaltelim: feeding a widow and daughters, paying a Kesuvah, and Parnasah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ONE WHO ENTRUSTS MONEY TO GIVE TO HIS DAUGHTER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Levi gave money to David for Levi's daughter (for her dowry or to buy a field for her), and she says 'I trust my husband (give the money to him)', David should do like he was instructed;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi says, even if he bought a field for her and she wanted to sell it, she could. It is as if it is already sold! (Therefore, we heed her.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This applies to an adult; but the actions of a minor are void.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Levi gave money to David, to give to Levi's son-in-law to buy a field for Levi's daughter, and she says 'give it to my husband', if she is Nesu'ah, we heed her. If she is Arusah, David does like he was instructed;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yosi says, we heed an adult, whether she is Nesu'ah or Arusah. We do not heed a minor, whether Nesu'ah or Arusah. Rather, David does like he was instructed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In which case do they argue?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about a Nesu'ah minor. R. Meir says that we heed her. R. Yosi says that even if she is Nesu'ah, we heed her only if she is an adult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection - Question:</span> If so, who taught the Seifa, which says 'but the actions of a minor are void?'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not R. Yosi. He already said 'it is like a field that she wants to sell', which shows that he discusses only an adult, who can sell!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, R. Meir taught it. The Mishnah is abbreviated; it means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>David does like he was instructed. This is if she was Arusah, but if she was Nesu'ah, we heed her. This refers to an adult, but the actions of a minor are void.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They argue about an Arusah adult. (R. Meir says, David does like he was instructed; R. Yosi says, we heed her.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ONE WHO LEFT MONEY FOR HIS CHILDREN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(Ilfa was very poor, and went away to earn money. He returned and found out that had he stayed, he would have been appointed Rosh Yeshiva.) He hung himself on a mast.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Ilfa:</span> If anyone can say a Tosefta of R. Chiya and R. Oshaya, for which I cannot bring its source in the Mishnah, I will fall and drown!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>An elder asked the source of the following Tosefta.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one said 'give a Shekel to my children each week', and they need a Sela, we give to them a Sela. If he said 'give to them only a Shekel', we give to them only a Shekel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he said 'if they die, others should inherit in place of them', whether or not he said 'only', we give to them only a Shekel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Ilfa:</span> That is like R. Meir, who says (in our Mishnah) that it is a Mitzvah to fulfill the words of the deceased.</p></div>
