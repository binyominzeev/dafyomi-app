<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TRANSGRESSING TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava):</span> The Torah forbids being Makdish a Tam to Bedek ha'Bayis, yet it takes effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Makdish a Tam to Bedek ha'Bayis, even though he transgressed a Lav, it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The same source that teaches that Hekdesh of a Ba'al Mum for the Mizbe'ach takes effect teaches also about Hekdesh of a Tam to Bedek ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava):</span> Theft is forbidden, yet the thief can acquire the stolen object!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one stole wood and made Kelim, (or) wool and he made garments, he pays the value at the time he stole it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Asher Gazal" teaches that the Mitzvah to return theft applies only if it is like the object he stole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to Abaye, why is the verse needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that one adds a Chomesh only for what he stole (and swore falsely about), but not for what his father stole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava):</span> One may not enter the borrower's house to take a security, but if one did so, it is like a properly obtained security!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One must return a pillow before night, and a plow before day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Hashev Tashiv" teaches that it is a proper security.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to Abaye, why is the verse needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Without it, one might have thought that he transgressed, and need not return it at all. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye):</span> One may not harvest one's entire field. If one did so, he must give Pe'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Pe'ah should be designated and not harvested. If it was harvested, one separates (the amount that should have been left) from the sheaves (and gives it to the poor). If this was not done, he separates from the stack before Miru'ach (final processing);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Miru'ach was already done, he separates the proper amount, tithes it, and gives it to the poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yishmael says, even if he made a dough, he separates from the dough and gives to the poor. (He still did not acquire it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The repetition "Azov Ta'azov" teaches that he does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to Rava, why is the verse needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches about a similar case in which one must leave for the poor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one declared his vineyard Hefker, and promptly harvests it, he must leave Peret (grapes that fall during harvesting), Olelos (deficient clusters), Shikchah and Pe'ah for the poor, but he is exempt from Ma'aseros.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT DO THEY ARGUE ABOUT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> We answered every question against Rava and Abaye. What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> They argue about whether or not Beis Din forces the lender to return Ribis Ketzutzah (contracted interest):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Beis Din forces the lender to return Ribis Ketzutzah, but not Avak Ribis (that comes through a sale).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Beis Din does not force the lender to return even Ribis Ketzutzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha):</span> That argument is not based on whether or not transgressions accomplish something, rather, on verses!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yochanan's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak):</span> He learns from "ba'Neshech Nasan v'Tarbis Lakach va'Chai Lo Yichyeh." He will die (at the hands of Heaven); it will not help to return the Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> He learns from "... v'Yaresa me'Elokecha" - one returns usury because he fears Hash-m, but Beis Din does not force him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> He learns from the end of the first verse, "(Lo Yichyeh) Mos Yumas Damav Bo" - those who lend on usury are compared to murderers;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like one cannot undo murder, one cannot undo Ribis by returning it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Elazar learns from "v'Chei Achicha Imach" - return it, in order that the borrower will live.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our question remains! What do Rava and Abaye argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They argue about whether or not <i>Shinuy acquires</i>. (This is unlike we said on Amud A. Rather, Rava holds like the opinion that a stolen object must be returned, even if it was irreversibly changed. Alternatively, they argue about whether a deviation from Torah law <i>would</i> take effect if there were no verses to this effect. However, in every case there are verses, and they argue about how to expound them. They always agree whether or not the transgression accomplished anything. Shitah - when Abaye expounds to teach that it does not accomplish anything, he exempts from lashes, and Rava obligates. The question was if they ever argue about whether he accomplished anything.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> They argue about Ribis Ketzutzah. Abaye exempts from returning it, and Rava obligates returning it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Abaye does not exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, they argue about whether Shinuy acquires.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HAKRAVAH OF A BA'AL MUM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Kol Asher Bo Mum Lo Sakrivu"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It need not forbid slaughtering a Ba'al Mum (in the Mikdash). Another verse forbids this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it forbids being Makdish a Ba'al Mum for a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is the source that one who is Makdish (and offers) a Ba'al Mum transgresses five Lavim - for making it Hekdesh, Shechitah, Zerikah (throwing the blood on the Mizbe'ach), total Haktarah (burning all of it on the Mizbe'ach), and partial Haktarah. (We shall conclude that there are separate lashes for total and partial Haktarah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, he transgresses even for Kabalah (receiving the blood in a Kli).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It need not forbid Shechitah. Another verse forbids this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which verse forbids this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Question: What do we learn from "Averes Oh Shavur... Lo Sakrivu"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It need not forbid being Makdish a Ba'al Mum for a Korban. A previous verse forbids this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it forbids slaughtering a Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"<i>V'Isheh</i> Lo Sitnu Mehem" refers to things burned on the Mizbe'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps only total Haktarah is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even "Mehem" is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to forbid Zerikah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Al ha'Mizbe'ach".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>"La'Shem" includes Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach (the goat sent to Azazel on Yom Kipur).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "La'Shem" excludes. It does not include!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Oh Korban" obligates (for Shechutei Chutz) even for Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis, for they are called Korban - "va'Nakrev Es Korban Hash-m"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'El Pesach Ohel Mo'ed Lo Hevi'o" teaches that it applies only to what may be offered in the Mikdash. This excludes Bedek ha'Bayis. (They are normally Ba'alei Mumim, for one may not be Makdish a Tam animal to Bedek ha'Bayis.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we exclude Bedek ha'Bayis, but not Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach (and Parah Adumah; some say to omit this - see Tosfos DH v'), which is (are) fit for the Mikdash!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "La'Shem" excludes the Se'ir (and Parah), which is (are) not exclusively for Hash-m. (The Se'ir is sent to Azazel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> In each case we learn from the context:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There, "v'El Pesach... " includes all animals Kosher for Korbanos (i.e. Temimim), so "la'Shem" excludes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here, "v'Isheh" excludes things not burned on the Mizbe'ach, so "la'Shem" includes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If not for "la'Shem" it would be permitted to be Makdish a Ba'al Mum for Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach. (We take two goats, and a lottery determines which will be a Chatas and which the Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The lottery is valid only if both goats were Kesherim to be the Chatas!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> The Beraisa is like Chanan ha'Mitzri, who says that even if the blood of the Chatas is in a Kli and the Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach died, we bring another goat (for Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach, and the blood in the Kli is valid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Granted, Chanan says that Ein Dichuy. However, we need not say that he does not require a new lottery. Perhaps two new goats must be taken, and a lottery determines which will be the Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach (and the other will graze until it gets a Mum!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> Rather, the Beraisa is like R. Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If one of the goats died, we take a replacement for it. We do not require a new lottery.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> The case is, the Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach got a Mum, and it was redeemed onto another goat. ("La'Shem" forbids redeeming it onto a Ba'al Mum);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Tam goats are required when taking two goats for the lottery, for both of them must be Kesherim to be the Chatas, for we do not know which will become the Chatas. Here, the goat will definitely be the Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach, so one is not lashed for a Ba'al Mum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
