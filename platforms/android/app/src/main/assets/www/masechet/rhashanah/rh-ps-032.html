<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: MUSAF OF ROSH HASHANAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> In Musaf of Rosh Hashanah, one says Avos, Gevuros, Kedushas Hash-m, including Malchuyos, but not blowing the Shofar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Then Kedushas ha'Yom and blowing Shofar,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Then Zichronos and blowing Shofar,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Then Shofros and blowing Shofar,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Then Avodah, Hoda'ah, and Birchas Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> There's no point in mentioning Malchuyos and not blowing Shofar; it should be included in Kedushas ha'Yom and then blow Shofar.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>R. AKIVA'S ARGUMENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could R. Akiva say that there would be no point in mentioning Malchuyos - the Torah instructs it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant that since it is already different to Zichronos and Shofros, it should also have less Pesukim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SOURCES FOR THE BERACHOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Beraisa lists the sources for the obligation to say the Berachos of Avos, Gevuros, and Kedushas Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Eliezer and R. Akiva cite different sources for Zichronos, Shofros, and Kedushas ha'Yom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The source for the Berachah of Malchuyos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> The Torah says "I am Hash-m" and continues "In the seventh month."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Yehudah):</span> A Pasuk shows that Zichronos is always to be accompanied by Malchuyos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where is Kedushas ha'Yom said?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As taught in a Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> It is said with Malchuyos, as we find that it is always in the fourth Berachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> It is said with Zichronos, as we always find that it is in the middle Berachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(The Beraisa continues):</span> When the Sanhedrin went to Usha, R. Yochanan ben Beruka followed R. Yochanan ben Nuri (in the Mishnah, that Malchuyos is said in Kedushas Hash-m and not accompanied by Shofar).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel told him that such was not the custom in Yavneh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>On the second day, R. Chanina ben R. Yosi Hagelili followed R. Akiva (putting Malchuyos in Kedushas ha'Yom with Shofar blowing).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel told him that such was the custom in Yavneh.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This shows that R. Shimon ben Gamliel followed R. Akiva, yet R. Akiva said that Kedushas ha'Yom should be said with Malchuyos, and he said that Kedushas ha'Yom should be said with Zichronos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel only followed R. Akiva regarding blowing the Shofar for Malchuyos, but not regarding the placement of Kedushas h'Yom.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "the second day" mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>It can't mean the second day of Yom Tov, as that would mean that Elul was a full month, which never happened after Ezra's time?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means the next day of Rosh Hashanah which occurred, i.e. in the following year.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE NUMBER OF PESUKIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There must be no less than ten Pesukim for Malchuyos, Zichronos and Shofros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> If he said three Pesukim for each, he is Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE TEN PESUKIM OF MALCHUYOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do the ten Pesukim of Malchuyos correspond to?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Levi):</span> The expressions of Hallel in Tehillim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are more than ten!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The ten which say to praise Him with Shofar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosef):</span> They correspond to the Ten Commandments.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> They correspond to the ten utterances with which the world was created.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>These are the nine "And he said"'s of Bereishis, plus Bereishis itself.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>R. YOCHANAN BEN NURI'S VIEW</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Gemara discusses R. Yochanan ben Nuri's opinion that it is adequate to say three Pesukim for each.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he mean three Pesukim from Torah, from Nevi'im, and Kesuvim, totaling nine, thus differing from the Tana Kama by one, or one from each, totaling three?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see that he means a total of three:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There must be no less than ten Pesukim for Malchuyos, Zichronos and Shofros.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he said seven from each, corresponding to the Seven Heavens, he is Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> If he says less, he should still say seven; if he says three, he is still Yotzei, corresponding to Torah, Nevi'im and Kesuvim, or Kohanim, Levi'im and Yisraelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Halachah follows R. Yochanan ben Nuri.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>MISHNAH: RESTRICTED PESUKIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We do not mention Pesukim of Malchuyos, Zichronos and Shofros that deal with punishment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We begin with a Pasuk from Torah, and finish with one from Nevi'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yose):</span> If one finishes with a Pasuk from Torah, he is Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>EXAMPLES AND QUALIFICATIONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Gemara lists examples of Pesukim dealing with punishment which may not be used (as cited).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, one may use Pesukim dealing with punishment to idolaters, such as the examples cited.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We do not mention a Pasuk dealing with the remembrance of an individual, even if it is a beneficial one, such as the examples cited.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Pesukim about Pikdonos are like Zichronos, such as that of Sarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> They are not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if they are, Sarah was an individual, which we ruled out!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since she had many descendants, it is considered a remembrance of many.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Beraisa discusses a dispute between R. Yosi and R. Yehudah as to the number of mentions of Malchuyos in Se'u She'arim and Zamru Elokim (as cited).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>It then mentions another dispute of theirs concerning a Pasuk of Zichronos that also mentions Teru'ah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> It can be said both with Zichronos and Shofros.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> It can only be said with Zichronos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Concerning a Pasuk of Malchuyos that also mentions Teru'ah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> It can be said both with Malchuyos and Shofros.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> It can only be said with Malchuyos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Concerning a Pasuk that only mentions Teru'ah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> It can be said with Shofros.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> It cannot be said at all.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>THE FINISHING PASUK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah said that we begin with a Pasuk from Torah, and finish with one from Nevi'im, and R. Yose said that if one finishes with a Pasuk from Torah, he is Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It seems according to R. Yosi that it is b'Di'eved acceptable if he finishes with a Pasuk from Torah, yet a Beraisa states that he held it to be praiseworthy!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Emend the Mishnah to read that he <i>should</i> finish with a Pasuk from Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it said "If he did, then he is Yotzei," implying b'Di'eved?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Emend it to read that he <i>should</i> finish with a Pasuk from Torah, but if he <i>did</i> finish with a Pasuk from Nevi'im, he is Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Similarly, we find in a Beraisa that the devoted ones would finish with a Pasuk from Torah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>THE PESUKIM FOR MALCHUYOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Gemara discusses the rule that the first three and the tenth Pasuk should be from the Torah:</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is good for Zichronos and Shofros, but for Malchuyos there are only three Pesukim in the Torah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see in a Beraisa that other Pesukim in the Torah are considered to refer to Malchuyos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Shema Yisrael...", "ve'Yadaata ha'Yom" and "Atah Haraysa" are considered to be Malchuyos according to R. Yosi, but not according to R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">11)</span><p>MISHNAH: SHACHARIS AND MUSAF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>On Rosh Hashanah, the Shofar is blown during Musaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>When Hallel is said (on festivals), it is done by the one leading Shacharis.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">12)</span><p>UNDERSTANDING THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Shofar is blown during Musaf, presumably because there are more people and it is more honorable, then Hallel should also be at Musaf; if it is at Shacharis to show zeal, then so too should be Shofar?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The government decreed against Shofar, so it was changed to Musaf to avoid detection.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah implies that there is no Hallel on Rosh Hashanah - why not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m told the Melachim that it would be inappropriate for them to do so while undergoing judgment.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">13)</span><p>MISHNAH: LAWS OF SHOFAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>For the Shofar, one may not travel beyond the Techum on Shabbos, clear away rubble, climb a tree, ride an animal, swim, or cut it, whether with something prohibited d'Rabanan or d'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, he may rinse it with water or wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We do not prevent children from blowing the Shofar, but rather we encourage them to learn how to blow it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One who blows absent-mindedly is not Yotzei, nor is someone who hears Shofar from such a person Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">14)</span><p>TRANSGRESSING YOM TOV FOR SHOFAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The reason why one may not break Yom Tov for Shofar is that Shofar is an Ase, whereas Yom Tov is both an Aseh and a Lo Sa'aseh, which is not pushed aside.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Mishnah need to prohibit the d'Oraisa of climbing a tree etc. when it has already prohibited the d'Rabanan (of Techum)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The format is that "this, and needless to say this" is forbidden.</p></div>
