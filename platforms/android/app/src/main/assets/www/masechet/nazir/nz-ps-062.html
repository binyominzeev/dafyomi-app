<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>VOWS OF <i>KUSIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Ish Ki Yafli Neder b'Erkecha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah calls Erchin a Neder, to equate Erchin to Nedarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ish" teaches that Kusim may vow Korbanos like Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> What does "Ish Ki Yafli" teach? ("Bnei Yisrael" teaches that Kusim cannot be Ma'arich. Surely, the Hekesh to Nedarim teaches that Erchin apply to Kusim, i.e. Yisraelim can be Ma'arich a Kusi. Above, we expounded this from "Ish"!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes a Mufla Samuch l'Ish (someone close to adulthood. If he understands vows, he can be Ma'arich.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that vows of a Mufla Samuch l'Ish are valid mid'Oraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that Mufla Samuch l'Ish is mid'Rabanan, what does the verse teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes a Kusi Mufla Samuch l'Ish (his vows of Erchin are valid mid'Oraisa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This is like the following opinion:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Bnei Yisrael have Erchin values (if one is Ma'arich a Yisrael, this is valid); Kusim do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Kusim cannot be Ma'arich!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ish" teaches that they can.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the other opinion (brought on 61b), what does the verse teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Bnei Yisrael can vow to give Erchin; Kusim cannot;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Kusim have no Erchin (values)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ish" teaches that they have Erchin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Even a month old baby has an Erech (so we cannot say that the verse teaches that a Kusi Mufla Samuch l'Ish has an Erech). What does "Yafli" teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> It teaches that vows of an adult Kusi are valid only if he understands vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Yafli" also regarding Nezirus. What does this teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nezirus is equated to vows. We could have learned from "Yafli" written regarding Erchin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It teaches (regarding Nezirus) about Yados (incomplete expressions of acceptance) that are ambiguous.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Ambiguous Yados are valid Yados.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> They are not valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) Question:</span> This answers for Abaye (we need a source that Yados Nezirus must be clear, unlike other Yados), but not for Rava!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rosh) Question:</span> This answers for Rava (this is the source that Yados must be clear. Alternatively, it teaches that ambiguous Yados help for Nezirus), but not for Abaye!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Yafli" teaches R. Tarfon's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> (If people accepted Nezirus on Tnai, e.g. contingent on the identity of an approaching man,) R. Tarfon says, none of them are Nezirim, for Nezirus requires Hafla'ah (explicitness).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This answer works for R. Tarfon, but not for Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "Yafli" teaches like R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Annulment of vows has no solid source in the written Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, it has a solid source. "Yafli" is written twice;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Once teaches that a vow cannot be annulled without regret. The other teaches that it can be annulled through regret.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>VOWS OF A WIFE AND A SLAVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Vows of slaves have a stringency that does not apply to vows of women: one can annul his wife's vows, but not his slave's vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A husband's annulment is permanent. If a master annulled his slave's vow, when the slave becomes free, he must fulfill his vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Question:</span> Why can a master force his slave to transgress Nezirus, but not vows or Erchin?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Presumably, we learn that he can force his slave to transgress Nezirus from "to put an Isur on his own soul." This excludes a slave, who does not own his own soul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This verse was written regarding vows. It should apply to vows!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> The case is, a cluster of grapes is in front of the slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he vowed not to eat it, (this will not make him weak, for) he can eat other grapes, so the master cannot force him to transgress;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he accepted Nezirus, all grapes are forbidden to him, therefore, the master can force him (lest he become weak).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Beraisa says (Stam) that one cannot force his slave to transgress a vow, i.e. even if there are no other grapes around, and he will become weak if he doesn't eat these!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The case is, he vowed not to eat a Chartzan (grape peel or pit).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Such a vow will not weaken him. Nezirus forbids him to eat all produce of the vine!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If there is nothing else around to eat, keeping his vow will cause him to become weak!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa says that the master must force the slave to transgress Nezirus (if not, the slave must observe Nezirus). The slave is not bound by his (other) vows and oaths even if the master does not force him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says regarding oaths "to harm or benefit" - just like benefiting is optional, also harming;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>An oath to harm another (e.g. the master) is invalid. (We learn from oaths to vows, but not to Nezirus.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A SLAVE WHO FLED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a slave (who accepted Nezirus) fled from his master, he may not drink wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, he drinks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Suggestion:</span> The Tana'im argue about Shmuel's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one declares his slave to be ownerless, the slave becomes a free convert and does not need a document of freedom. (We are thinking that when the slave flees, the master despairs of getting him back, which makes him Hefker.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir holds like Shmuel, and R. Yosi disagrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, both hold like Shmuel (but they hold that the master does not despair);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi says that he drinks so that he will be strong when he will return;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir forbids him to drink, in order that he will suffer, and he will want to return (expecting that his master will force him to drink).</p>
