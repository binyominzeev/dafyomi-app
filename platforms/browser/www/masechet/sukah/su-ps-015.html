<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: TURNING A CEILING INTO SECHACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Beis Shamai requires the shaking of each plank as well as the removal of every second plank while Beis Hillel permits the Sechach after either of these acts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> He must remove every second plank (and shaking is irrelevant).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE RATIONALE FOR THE ARGUMENT IN OUR MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand that Beis Hillel requires an act to remove the stigma of Ta'aseh v'lo Min he'Asuy, but why does Beis Shamai demand <i>two</i> acts (one should suffice)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To remove the concern of Gezeiras Tikrah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then, again, removing every second plank should be sufficient!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is owing to Gezeiras Tikrah and Beis Shamai means that <i>even though</i> he shakes the planks, he must remove every second plank in order to make the Sukah usable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then R. Meir is not arguing, he is only restating the position of Beis Shamai!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir is telling R. Yehudah that Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai do not argue on the matter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It seems that R. Meir and R. Yehudah have already argued over Gezeiras Tikrah in the previous Mishnah (14a)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya b. Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> The previous Mishnah speaks of planks which are less than four Tefachim wide (thus are not subject to Gezeiras Tikrah), but which have been smoothed (and may be prohibited lest they be confused with Kelim having a Beis Kibul [Gezeiras Kelim]).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But given the position of R. Yehudah citing Rav (who on 12b permitted male arrows, in spite of the possible decree forbidding them because of female arrows) if they did not issue a Gezeirah there, why should they do so here?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, both Mishnayos discuss Gezeiras Tikrah with the first Mishnah introducing the Machlokes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would the Mishnah need to discuss it twice?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In our Mishnah, R. Yehudah points out that Gezeiras Tikrah is the opinion only of Beis Shamai, to which R. Meir responds that it is unanimous.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But, according to Shmuel, why are they arguing in our Mishnah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We understand that, according to Rav (who says that R. Meir and R. Yehudah argue regarding four-Tefach planks) that they argue over Gezeiras Tikrah (since most ceilings use four-Tefach planks).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But for Shmuel (who says that all agree to invalidate four-Tefach planks) why should even Beis Hillel (according to R. Yehudah) permit the use of the ceiling (whose planks, presumably, are four Tefachim)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah concedes that planks of four Tefachim invalidate a Sukah, but only if one can do nothing about it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, if one does something to be Mevatel their status as planks of a ceiling it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is because the suspicion that one may come to use a ceiling no longer exists.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Machlokes in our Mishnah is over what is required to be Mevatel the status of the planks as a ceiling.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: METAL RODS AND A SUKAH IN A HAYSTACK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It is permitted to use metal rods or bed-posts provided one leaves space between them equal to the rods themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One who burrowed out a room within a haystack has not made a Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PARUTZ KE'OMED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah seems to refute R. Huna bar R. Yehoshua in his position regarding Parutz Ke'Omed!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> Parutz ke'Omed is permitted by the walls of Shabbos (if the spaces between the posts of a wall are the same as the posts themselves, the wall is Kosher).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna bar R. Yehoshua):</span> It is not permitted to carry there unless the Omed exceeds the Parutz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Our Mishnah seems to permit with Sechach equal to the rods!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah, which says 'like spaces,' does not mean identical spaces, but spaces which would allow rods of the same width to be moved in and out easily (so the Sechach covers more than 50% of the surface).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But from the language of the Mishnah it would be permitted even if, indeed, they were exactly equal!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> Our Mishnah requires him to leave (slightly larger) spaces for the Sechach to allow the Sechach (equivalent in width to the rods) to be inserted easily, thus creating a majority of Sechach (see Tosfos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> When he spreads the Sechach over the rods, he lays the Sechach perpendicular (not parallel) to the rods, which will place more Sechach than rods (or the Sechach would fall through the spaces).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>(FORMER) BED POSTS ARE NOT VALID SECHACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is our Mishnah a support for R. Ami b. Tivyumi (who invalidates a Sukah whose Sechach is vessels/clothes which are no longer fit for use)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, because our Mishnah may be explained (as R. Chanan, citing Rebbi, explained another Mishnah) as speaking when the bed-post (the long side post or the short head post) still has its two legs still attached to it, and such a bedpost is still fit for use (and still subject to Tum'ah).</p></div>
