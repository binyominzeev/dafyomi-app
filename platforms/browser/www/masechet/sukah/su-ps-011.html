<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SPEAKING <i>DIVREI KEDUSHAH</i> WHILE UNCLOTHED (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A house which is less than 10 Tefachim is still distinct from a Kilah (which is viewed as his garment) because a house is fixed in place, it is like a Kinuf (and his head is viewed as being with the rest of his body).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ALTERNATE RENDITION OF SHMUEL (first cited in Daf 10:5)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> It is permitted to sleep under a Kilah made for Chasanim (two posts, unattached to the bed) in the Sukah, even if it is more than 10 Tefachim tall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa teaches that one who sleeps in a Kilah has not fulfilled his obligation!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Kilah has a roof (at least a Tefach wide).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa which discusses the Naklitin (two posts) permits it only if it is less than 10 Tefachim tall!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Naklitin is more stringent than a Kilah since the posts are fixed on the bed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Naklitin are fixed then they should be viewed as an Ohel even with less than 10 Tefachim (like a Kinuf)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Naklitin may well be <i>more</i> fixed than a Kilah but it is <i>less</i> fixed than a four-poster bed, which explains why one may sleep under it if it is less than ten Tefachim high, even though a four-poster bed is not permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar R. Huna):</span> A Kilah is permitted even if it is more than ten Tefachim high, and has a roof (i.e. it is parallel with the ground, and not like a tent).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is this position!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Like R. Yehudah who holds that a temporary Ohel does not have the power to negate a permanent one.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah permits sleeping under a bed in the Sukah (even if it is higher than ten Tefachim from the ground).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then Rabah bar R. Huna should have reported that the Halachah is like R. Yehudah (not taught it in his own name)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would then have thought that R. Yehudah's reason is because a bed is (not an Ohel since it is) made to sleep on top of and not underneath.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: A SUKAH WITH A GROWING VINE COVERING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Sukah which has a growing vine, a pumpkin or a creeper on the roof, arranged on a trellis, to form part of the Sechach may not be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This can be rectified either by adding more Sechach (to form a majority) or by detaching them from the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Anything which can receive Tum'ah or which does not grow from the ground may not be used as Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TA'ASEH V'LO MIN HE'ASUY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef citing Rav):</span> Cutting the branch is insufficient, one must also shake each branch that one cuts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Huna reported that this was said by Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This correction bothered R. Yosef who angrily said that he had never claimed that <i>only</i> Rav had said it, and that it could well be that <i>both</i> Rav and Shmuel said it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Huna explained that what he indeed had meant was that it was Shmuel who said it and <i>not</i> Rav (who disagrees).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Chiya b. Ashi quoted Rav as maintaining that cutting something or cutting it off, is sufficient - to remove the Pesul of 'Ta'aseh ve'Lo min he'Asuy'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>An incident demonstrated Rav's position when R. Amram Chasida put Tzitzis on his wife's four cornered garments (see Rashi) and he only cut the eight strings apart after affixing them to the garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Chiya b. Ashi cited Rav as permitting this case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should then follow that, according to Shmuel (who requires lifting the Sechach after it is cut), then cutting the Tzitzis should <i>not</i> be enough (yet Shmuel taught the opposite in the name of R. Chiya)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Shmuel citing R. Chiya) If one threaded the Tzitzis into two corners before cutting them, they are Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We assume that this speaks when one made the Tzitzis and then cut them, from which we see that cutting the Tzitzis <i>is</i> sufficient to remove Ta'aseh ve'Lo min he'Asuy!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa speaks when he cut them first and then made the Tzitzis (thereby removing the Pesul of 'Ta'aseh ve'Lo min he'Asuy').</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What, then, is the need for Shmuel to teach us this obvious Din?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That the Tzitzis does not become Pasul by the fact that they were threaded in the holes of <i>two</i> corners (in spite of the Pasuk 'al Tzitzis <i>ha'Kanaf</i>').</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that if one affixed the string and then cut it into segments that it is Pasul (unlike Rav who permitted this case)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means that they are Pasul only until they are cut, but not permanently.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Levi supports this explanation.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Shmuel maintains that the Beraisa means that these Tzitzis are permanently Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Alternate Rendition of the above:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Masnahh reported that he asked just such a question of Shmuel who invalidated the Tzitzis which were affixed and then cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">First Question (on Rav who validates such a case):</span> The Beraisa says that this case is Pasul!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Second Question (on Rav):</span> The Beraisa provides the rationale of Ta'aseh to forbid a Sukah which has a growing vine, a pumpkin or a creeper on the roof arranged on a trellis to form part of the Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Beraisa must be speaking when they were cut, because if they were still attached, the Tana would not need the reason of Ta'aseh (since the attached Sechach would anyway be Pasul).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>We see that cutting does not validate the Sukah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to the second Question):</span> This Beraisa speaks when the branch was torn from the tree at its source, and left in that position (even Rav would agree that cutting it would not be a sufficient Asiyah, since this cutting is not noticeable).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The first Beraisa, however, remains a question on Rav.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE <i>MACHLOKES</i> RAV AND SHMUEL ON <i>KETZITZAH</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shall we understand their Machlokes (whether Ketzitzah is an Asiyah) to be a Machlokes Tanaim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon b. Yehotzadak invalidates the Hadas if one transgressed and removed the berries on Yom Tov while the Chachamim hold that the Hadas is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is assumed that an Asiyah is needed here (to bind the Minim together) and that the Minim, like a Sukah, must have Ta'aseh V'Lo Min He'Asui.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Chachamim hold (like Rav) that Ketzitzah is an Asiyah (by Sukah hence the plucking of the berries is the same) and R. Shimon b. Yehotzadak holds (like Shmuel) that Ketzitzah it is not an acceptable Asiyah by Sukah (nor is plucking the berries by the Hadas).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, they both hold, like Shmuel, that Ketzitzah is not an Asiyah, but they are arguing over whether we learn Lulav from Sukah (and prohibit- R. Shimon) or not (and permit- Chachamim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> They are arguing over whether Lulav requires an Asiyah [Eged] (R. Shimon) or not (Chachamim), while agreeing that any Asiyah which we <i>would</i> find by Lulav <i>would</i> be learned from Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The source for such a Machlokes is found in the Beraisa where R. Yehudah learns from the Gezeirah Shavah of Lekichah that the three species need to be tied.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Rabanan did not receive a tradition to learn this Gezeirah Shavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa which teaches that it is a <i>Mitzvah</i> to tie the species together seems not to be in concert with <i>either</i> opinion!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to R. Yehudah it should not be Kosher without being tied.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to Rabanan, whence the Mitzvah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is the Rabanan and the Mitzvah derives from the command to beautify the Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR THE LIMITATIONS ON SECHACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence that Sechach is not Kosher if it is Mekabel Tum'ah or does not grow from the ground?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Resh Lakish):</span> The Pasuk refers to the primordial clouds as emerging from the earth, hence the Sechach must emerge from the earth and not be susceptible to Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What of the opinion that the Sukos of the desert were actual tents (and not clouds), since;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We have learned that R. Eliezer and R. Akiva disagree?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Pasuk links Sukah to the Korban Chagigah (that which is not Mekabel Tum'ah and grows from the ground [R. Yochanan's view of animals]).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Following that logic, we should <i>only</i> be able to use <i>animals</i> (hides) for Sechach!!</p></div>
