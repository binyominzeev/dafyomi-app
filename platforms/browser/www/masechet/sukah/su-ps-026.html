<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">First Beraisa:</span> Wedding participants.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> A groom and all of the wedding participants are Peturim from Tefilah, Tefilin but are obligated in Shema.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shila):</span> The groom is even Patur from Shema.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Second Beraisa:</span> Dealers in Tashmishei Kedushah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chananya b. Akavya):</span> Scribes, wholesalers and retailers of STa"M, and similar others involved in divine service are Peturim from all Mitzvos</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This was as taught by R. Yosi ha'Gelili (Osek B'Mitzvah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Third Beraisa:</span> Travelers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Travelers are Peturim from Sukah when they travel and are obligated when they are not traveling.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Those travelling for Mitzvos are exempt day and night regardless of the time they travel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>In the reported incident R. Chisda and Rabah bar R. Huna saw themselves as exempt when they went to the home of the Resh Gelusa in Sura.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Fourth Beraisa:</span> Watchmen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Watchmen are Peturim from Sukah when they watch and are obligated when they are not watching.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The same holds for watchmen who remain in one place (at their posts).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let them make a Sukah there!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> One does not live that way during the year, and the Sukah must recall one's normal residence (Teshvu k'Ein Taduru).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Seeing the watchman with his Sukah would invite thieves to the other direction.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When will these answers show a difference?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When watching a mound of fruit (it can be watched from one spot, but it does not recall normal residence).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A SICK PERSON IS EXEMPT FROM SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> Even one who is moderately sick (enough that residing in the Sukah would be hard for him) is exempt from Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Gamliel):</span> R. Yosi exempted me due to my eye discomfort.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav permitted R. Acha to sleep under a Kilah because of insects (mosquitoes-Ran).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rava exempted R. Acha b. Ada due to the foul smell he experienced (from the floor) in the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rava is consistent with his assertion that one who is distressed by the Sukah is exempt from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah only exempt the ill!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It exempts even the <i>attendants</i> of the ill, while the distressed are personally exempt, but not their attendants.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>EATING ARAI (A CASUAL MEAL/SNACK) OUTSIDE OF THE SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What quantity of food is considered Arai?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> Two or three (Beitzim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that amount could suffice for some as a full meal (Keva)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Rather, Arai is the mouthful that a student takes on his way to the Academy (one Beitzah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>EATING ARAI VERSUS SLEEPING ARAI OUTSIDE OF THE SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One is permitted to eat Arai outside of the Sukah, but not sleep Arai (nap) outside of the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why may he not nap?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> We are concerned lest he fall into a deep sleep.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Then why is it permitted to sleep Arai with Tefilin, given the concern lest he fall asleep.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef b'Rebbi Ilai):</span> He instructs another to wake him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Mesharshia):</span> The guarantor (the waker) needs a guarantor!!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> Rather, the Beraisa regarding Tefilin speaks where he put his head down between his knees (where we are not concerned lest he fall deeply asleep in that position).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Because there is no amount of sleep which can universally be called sufficient (a nap might suffice for some, constituting their full sleep).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THREE BERAISOS ON TEFILIN AND SLEEP</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">First:</span> A person with Tefilin may sleep Arai but not Keva (when wearing them).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Second:</span> A person may sleep Arai or Keva (when the Tefilin are covered and lying near his head).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Third:</span> A person may not sleep Arai or Keva (when holding the Tefilin in his hand, lest they fall).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>ARAI SLEEP</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much time constitutes Arai?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rami b. Yechezkel):</span> The time to walk 100 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is supported in the Beraisa which instructs one who sees Keri when napping regarding the procedure for removing his Tefilin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He may handle the straps but not the Batim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Chachamim, who permit Arai (only during the day - Tosfos), state that Arai is the time to walk 100 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> It is not permitted to sleep, during the day, more than a horse (60 breaths).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Rabah b. Nachmani napped as long as Rav, who napped like Rebbi, who napped like Dovid ha'Melech, who napped like a horse, 60 breaths.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Abaye napped for longer (time to walk six Parsah from Pumbedisa to Bei Kuvi).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosef cited a Pasuk indicating that this was excessive for Abaye.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nasan):</span> One who naps during the day may either remove or remain wearing his Tefilin, but at night he must remove them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Young men must always remove their Tefilin, because they are accustomed to Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this to imply that R. Yosi forbids a Ba'al Keri from wearing Tefilin!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> No, he is speaking of young men who are with their wives, and they must remove their Tefilin before sleeping.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>One who cohabits with his wife and forgets that he is wearing Tefilin must wash his hands before touching any part of the Tefilin.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>MISHNAH: INCIDENTS REGARDING SMALL AMOUNTS OF FOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yochanan b. Zakai insisted on bringing small amounts of food into the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Tzadok ate less than a KeBEtzah outside of the Sukah without Netilas Yadayim or Bircas ha'Mazon.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>BEING MACHMIR ON ONESELF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The incident of R. Yochanan b. Zakai contradicts the principle set forth (that Arai is permitted outside of the Sukah) for which it is serving as an example!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> By emending the Mishnah we learn that one is permitted to be stringent and bring even small amounts into the Sukah without fear of conceit, which the incident supports.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The incident of R. Tzadok (in which he ate less than a KeBEtzah outside of the Sukah) should disprove those (R. Yosef and Abaye) who speaks of larger measures as being permitted!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The incident may be reporting the amount for Netilas Yadayim and Bircas ha'Mazon (a KeBEtzah), not the measure for bringing food into the Sukah.</p></div>
