<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: HALEL AND SIMCHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Halel and Simchah were all eight days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This teaches us that the full Halel and Simchah (with the Shalmei Simchah) and Kavod Yom Tov are required on Shemini Atzeres just as on the other days of the Sukos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SIMCHAH ON SHEMINI ATZERES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Simchah on the eighth?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ach Sameach comes to add the night of Shemini Atzeres.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it comes to add the first night of Yom Tov and to require that Shelamim be offered on Erev Yom Tov in order to provide Simchah that night!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ach divides, thus subtracting the first night from Simchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why add Shemini Atzeres and subtract the first night, when we could do the opposite?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We add that which is already preceded by Simchah, not that which is not.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>After completing his meal on the seventh day he should not dismantle the Sukah but he should bring down his utensils from there from Minchah-time in order to honor the upcoming Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ONE WHO IS UNABLE TO BRING DOWN HIS UTENSILS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What if one has no utensils to bring down?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Then what did he use all week!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What if he has no room to bring them down to?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya b. Ashi):</span> He invalidates the Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua b. Levi):</span> He lights a candle therein.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yehoshua was speaking of those in Chutz L'Aretz who must still use the Sukah; R. Chiya was speaking of those in Eretz Yisrael who do not need a Kosher Sukah any longer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The distinction of lighting a candle makes the matter evident in a small Sukah, but what evidence of ending the use of the Sukah is there in a large Sukah where one would ordinarily light a candle?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He brings soiled dishes into the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Rava has taught that soiled dishes (not cups) may not be brought into the Sukah, thus bringing them in provides the necessary distinction that the Mitzvah is over.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH: NISUCH HA'MAYIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> A gold pitcher of three Lugim was filled with water from the Shiloach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It was brought through the "water gate" and the Shofar was sounded.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Kohen went up the Kevesh and turned to his left to the first corner (Southwest).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>There were two silver receptacles for the Nisuch (R. Yehudah says they were plaster but the wine caused them to take a darker silver-like tone), one for water and one for wine.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>One hole was thicker than the other in order that the wine and water should end at the same time.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The more western receptacle was for water and the more eastern one was for wine, but if they were reversed they are Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The pitcher was of one Lug and the Nisuch was done for eight days (not just seven).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Menasech was told to raise his hands to show the People that he was doing the Nisuch, unlike the Tzedukim who would not do so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>In one such incident the People pelted the Tzeduki Kohen who poured the water on his feet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Nisuch was the same on Shabbos, except that the Shiloach water was prepared in a gold barrel from before Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If the water spilled out or became uncovered then water from the Kiyor was used in its place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This is because exposed water and wine may not be poured on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>BLOWING THE SHOFAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for blowing the Shofar at the time of the Nisuch ha'Mayim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> U'She'avtem Mayim b'Sason.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Two apostates, one named Sason and one Simchah were arguing...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Sason boasted that he is first in the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Simchah countered with a Pasuk of his own.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Sason cursed Simchah with a Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Simchah responded in kind, citing our Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Sason checked with R. Avahu.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>R. Avahu refuted Sason's interpretation of the Pasuk, and cursed him as well.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>GOING UP THE RAMP AND TURNING LEFT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Normally one always turns to the right with Nisuch ha'Mayim being one of three exceptions.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>THE BLACKENED RECEPTACLES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the receptacle for water darken?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Given that, b'Di'eved, both may receive wine, they both darkened.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>THE THICKER AND THINNER HOLES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It would seem that our Mishnah is R. Yehudah who has us bring only one Lug of water, thus the two holes of differing size would equalize the difference in quantity between the wine and the water?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even the Rabanan (who have both wine and water in the same quantity) would need different sized holes because of the difference in viscosity.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This seems supported by the fact that the difference between the two would not be enough to serve the equalizing purpose for R. Yehudah (Tzar vs. Rachav would be a greater difference than Tzar vs. Me'Uveh).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>THE DAMAGED MIZBE'ACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>When they pelted the Tzeduki Kohen, they damaged the corner of the Mizbe'ach, causing it to lose its square.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A fistful of salt was used to fill the gap.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This would not render the Mizbe'ach fit for use, but would bring Kavod to the Mizbe'ach by concealing its defect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Squareness is listed among the critical components of a Kosher Mizbe'ach (along with Kevesh, Keren and Yesod and R. Yosi b. Yehudah adds the Sovev).</p></div>
