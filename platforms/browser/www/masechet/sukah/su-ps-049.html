<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE PRIMORDIAL OPENINGS BENEATH THE MIZBE'ACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> These openings [Shitin] originate in the six days of Creation (proof text which is further expounded to teach that the openings go down to the depths, Hash-m's Handiwork).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is supported by Tana d'vei R. Yishmael from the word Bereishis, and by R. Yosi in the Beraisa (expounding the Pasuk in Yeshayah 5).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BURNING THE USED WINE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar b. Tzadok):</span> There was an opening (Lul) on the western side of the Mizbe'ach, between the Kevesh and the Mizbe'ach into which the wine dripped (not going to the depths).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Once in 70 years the young Kohanim would bring up the coagulated wine which was burnt (Isur Hana'ah), as learned from ba'Kodesh Hasech Nesech Shechar LaShem.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does this Pasuk imply that the wine remaining in the Shitin must be burnt?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The work Kodesh links the Nisuch to the Sereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who, then, is the author of the teaching that Nesachim only have Me'ilah prior to Nisuch but not after?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Elazar b. Tzadok (since, according to Rabanan, the wine went down to the depths and was not around to be burned!).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could even be Rabanan, speaking where it happened that the wine was caught in a Kli before it could descend.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Question:</span> It seems that this teaching is Rabanan since, according to R. Elazar b. Tzadok it must be burned while this Mishnah teaches that there is no Me'ilah after its use!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could even be R. Elazar, since nothing could have Me'ilah after its Mitzvah has been done (and the burning is not m'Ikar ha'Mitzvah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FILLING UP FROM WINE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> The Shitin were plugged up during the Nisuch so that the "throat" of the Mizbe'ach should appear full (as the Pasuk ba'Kodesh Hasech implies).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is this learned from ba'Kodesh Hasech?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> The word Shechar implies fullness.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> The satisfaction from wine comes from the throat (not the stomach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A Talmid Chacham who does not have much wine should drink the little that he has in large gulps, to derive satisfaction therefrom (Rava would thus enhance his experience from a Kos Shel Berachah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>DERASHOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Pasuk Mah Yafu Pa'amayich Bas Nadiv refers to Bnei Yisrael, the nation of Avraham Avinu, the Nadiv (the first to generously give himself to become a Jew), who would come for Aliyas Regel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Bei R. Anan):</span> Words of Torah are called a Yerech since they are learned in private, not in public.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This is supported by R. Elazar who taught the Kal va'Chomer that private matters (in this case Tzedakah, but readily applicable to Torah study) should certainly be conducted modestly.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Elazar taught the following five Derashos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tzedakah is greater than offering Korbanos (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Gemilus Chasadim is greater than Tzedakah (proof text, since reaping is greater than planting).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The merit of Tzedakah is not the amount given, but the Chesed involved in troubling oneself to give properly (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three ways in which Gemilus Chesed is greater than Tzedakah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It is done with both body and funds, it is done for rich and poor, to the living and to the dead.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>One who does Tzedakah and Mishpat fills the world with Chesed (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Not all who give Tzedakah merit to give it to worthy recipients (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>A Yarei Shamayim is assured that his Tzedakah will go to worthy recipients (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R Chama b. Papa):</span> Whomever has Chen is surely a Yarei Shamayim (same proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Toras Chesed refers to Torah Lishmah (alternately it refers to Torah studied in order to teach it).</p></div>
