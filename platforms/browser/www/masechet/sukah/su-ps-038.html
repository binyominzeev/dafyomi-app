<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: LATE NETILAS LULAV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One who arrived from his travels where he did not have Lulav and Esrog must do Netilas Lulav upon entering his home, "upon" (meaning prior to) eating.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One who did not do Netilas Lulav in the morning may do so all day.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>INTERRUPTING A MEAL FOR A PASSING MITZVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> While our Mishnah implies that he must interrupt his meal, we find regarding Tefilas Minchah that he may complete his meal!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Safra):</span> He must interrupt only when there is not likely to be sufficient time after his meal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Perhaps the distinction is simply between a d'Oraisa (Lulav on the first day) and a d'Rabanan (Tefilah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Rather, R. Safra answered the following question:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha implies that he must interrupt and the Seifa states that he has all day to make up the Netilas Lulav!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In response to that question R. Safra distinguished between a case where he had sufficient time and where he did not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Perhaps it is simply a case of l'Chatchilah and b'Di'eved!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> R. Safra answered the first question (the difference between Lulav and Tefilah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They are both d'Rabanan since we are speaking of the second day of Yom Tov, not the first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This seems reasonable, given that the Mishnah speaks of one who is coming in from his travels.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: READING THE HALEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may have an Eved, Isha or Katan dictate the words of Halel for him to repeat, but cursed is the one who does so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a Gadol recites Halel, the listener is Yotzei, and responds Halelukah to whatever the Gadol says.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Depending on local Minhag, Pesukim are either repeated or not, and a final Berachah is either recited or not.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>BEING MOTZI ANOTHER IN BIRKAS HA'MAZON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Halachah is that a son (who is only obligated d'Rabanan because of Chinuch) may be Motzi his father (who is only obligated d'Rabanan by virtue of the volume of food he ate).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>An Eved may be Motzi his master and a wife her husband (they are all on the same level of Chiyuv) but accursed is the one who does so.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">38b----------------------------------------38b</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE CUSTOMS OF HALEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Halachos regarding the original institution of Halel may be inferred from the vestiges of those practices remaining today.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Responding Halelukah (the first word of Halel) at the beginning of Halel after the Chazan teaches us that it is indeed appropriate to respond Halelukah after the Chazan (at the start of the Halel).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Responding Halelukah a second time at the end of the first phrase of Halel teaches the Halachah (para. b) of our Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Repeating Hodu LaShem teaches us that the listeners said the opening of each Perek.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanan b. Rava):</span> It is a Mitzvah to respond to the start of the Perakim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Repeating Ana Hash-m Hoshiyah Na reminds us of the first Halachah of our Mishnah (a minor dictating Halel to an adult who repeats his words).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Repeating Ana Hash-m Hatzlichah Na teaches us the last Halachah of our Mishnah (permission to repeat).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>He says Baruch Haba and the listeners respond with B'Shem Hash-m teaches Shome'a k'Oneh.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>SHOME'A K'ONEH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is one who hears, but does not respond, Yotzei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya b. Aba):</span> Great people taught that one is Yotzei (Shome'a k'Oneh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The source for Shome'a k'Oneh was taught by R. Shimon b. Pazi citing R. Yehoshua citing Bar Kapara as the Pasuk which speaks of Yoshiyahu as reading the Sefer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Sefer was read by Shafan!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This teaches Shome'a k'Oneh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Yoshiyahu recited the words which Shafan dictated?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Acha b. Yakov):</span> The Pasuk credits Yoshiyahu for his humility in the face of <i>hearing</i> the words.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>NOT SPLITTING THE VERSE BARUCH HA'BA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One should not pause for a breath between Baruch ha'Ba and b'Shem Hash-m in order to make it clear that it is one thought, and not a meaningless utterance of the Shem.</p></div>
