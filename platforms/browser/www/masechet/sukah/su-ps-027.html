<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE MEALS OF SUKOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> One is obligated to eat 14 meals in the Sukah (one each day and one each night).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> There is no minimum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> One who did not eat the first meal in the Sukah may make it up, even on the night of Shemini Atzeres.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> There is no way to make up a missed meal.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE OBLIGATION TO EAT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale of R. Eliezer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One must dwell in the Sukah as one resides at home, eating one meal in the day and one at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then what do the Chachamim hold?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even at home one may skip a meal if he desires.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then why is a person obligated to eat even the first meal in the Sukah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is derived from the parallel to the first night of Pesach, where eating is obligatory.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence that eating on the first night of Pesach is obligatory and not optional?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk mandates eating Matzah that night.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MAKING UP A MEAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could a person replace the first meal in the Sukah the remaining meals of Sukos are, themselves, obligatory (and one may not eat in the Sukah on Shemini Atzeres)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer retracted his position regarding the remaining days, thus allowing for the replacement meal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does one replace a meal?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> With bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is nothing unique and there is no way of identifying that as a replacement!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He replaces it with eating delicacies after a meal (as supported by the Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>RULINGS BY R. ELIEZER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (the guardian of King Agripas to R. Eliezer):</span> May I follow my normal custom of eating only one Seudah per day (assuming that R. Eliezer still maintains that one is obligated in two Seudos per day-Ritva).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely a person like yourself can dedicate one appetizer to the honor of your Creator!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Am I permitted to leave my Sukah (and family) in one city to join my Sukah (and family) in another?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, since I have ruled that leaving the Sukah cancels the previous days of the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> One may not move from Sukah to Sukah, nor build a Sukah on Chol ha'Moed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> One may do both.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>They agree that a collapsed Sukah may be rebuilt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Eliezer's rationale?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk dictates that the Sukah must be fit for seven days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will the Chachamim understand the Pasuk?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It instructs that the Sukah be made on the Chag, at any point during the Chag.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely it is obvious that a collapsed Sukah may be rebuilt!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have invalidated the rebuilt Sukah as not having been built for seven days.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF A SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> One must have one's own Sukah (just as one must have one's own Lulav) based on Lecha.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> While true of Lulav, this is not true of Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is since the words Kol ha'Ezrach indicate that all of Israel could be under one Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Surely that Sukah is not the property of each one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will Chachamim interpret Lecha (if, indeed, a borrowed Sukah is Kesheirah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It prohibits a Sukah made of stolen materials.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will R. Eliezer interpret Kol ha'Ezrach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To allow a Sukah to be built by a convert or Bar Mitzvah during Sukos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will the Chachamim provide for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once we have ruled that a Sukah may be built on Chol ha'Moed, no special exemption is required!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>VISITING ONE'S RAV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Ilai went to visit his Rebbi, R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Eliezer pointed out that by leaving his wife, R. Ilai was not properly fulfilling his Regel obligations.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is consistent with R. Eliezer's declaration that the lazy are to be praised.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>For even though they remain at home due to their laziness, they benefit by properly fulfilling the Torah's obligation to bring joy to one's wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we have learned that it is an obligation to visit one's Rebbi on the Regel (inferred from the exchange between the Shunamis and her husband in Melachim II, 4:23)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That obligation holds only when he is able to visit his Rebbi and return at night.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>CARE IN SAYING ONLY THAT WHICH ONE HEARD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>In the reported incident, R. Eliezer refused to answer a question (regarding adding to a temporary Ohel on Shabbos) because he had not heard that Din from his teachers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Instead, he changed the subject.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When his student acted on his own (and extended the Ohel), R. Eliezer distanced himself from the Sukah so as not to give the impression that his student was acting on his advice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the incident we see that R. Eliezer had left his home Sukah, violating his own rule that one must not go from Sukah to Sukah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is speaking on a different Regel, not Sukos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But still, he should have stayed home with his wife, according to his own teaching!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was a Shabbos, and not a Regel at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the prohibition of extending the Ohel could have been learned from R. Eliezer's own position restricting the use of a window shutter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> The window cover may only be put in place if it has a string and is hung, having been obviously designated as removable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> It may be put in place in either case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The window cover becomes Batel to the house, and is considered building on Shabbos; whereas the sheet in the Sukah was never meant to stay there.</p></div>
