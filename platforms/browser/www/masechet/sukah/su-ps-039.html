<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One should (also) not pause for a breath between Rabah and Mevorach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Safra, reverently):</span> That is not the same as Baruch ha'Ba b'Shem Hash-m (above) since here he intends to complete the phrase.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>REPEATING THE PESUKIM ACCORDING TO CUSTOM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rebbi would repeat the Pesukim from Ana onward.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Elazar b. Parta would repeat more Pesukim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What additional Pesukim did he repeat?</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE BERACHAH OVER HALEL ACCORDING TO CUSTOM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The custom only determines the Berachah at the conclusion, whereas prior to Halel he must make a Beracha.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is based on the teaching of R. Yehudah citing Shmuel that one makes a Berachah on a Mitzvah before its performance (Over L'asiayasan).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does "Over" come to mean "before?"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman b. Yitzchak):</span> Pasuk in Shmuel II.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Pasuk in Bereishis.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: ESROG OF SHEMITAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One who wishes to acquire an Esrog on Shemitah must receive it as a gift.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>PURCHASING FROM AN AM HA'ARETZ ON SHEMITAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What if he does not wish to give it as a gift?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Huna):</span> He absorbs its price into an inflated price for the Lulav to encourage him to give the Esrog.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't he purchase it outright?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we must not give Shemitah money to an Am ha'Aretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that we must not give him more than the value of three meals before Shabbos</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We are thus assuming that he will spend the money and not horde it for after Shemitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one forgot and gave him money for the Esrog, he must transfer the Kedushah of the money (now in the hands of the Am ha'Aretz) onto fruits in his possession.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He treats those with Kedushas Shevi'is.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The allowance to give him the value of three meals is restricted to produce which we know had been Hefker (if the produce was taken from a protected area, one must not purchase any amount from him at all).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Sheshes):</span> But the Beraisa indicates that, when dealing with (the various) produce (items listed which, presumably are) from Hefker, we are not restricted in the amount we may purchase from him!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Sheshes):</span> The allowance of the Beraisa is also limited to the value of a day's meals (Bichdei Man) as confirmed by Rabah bar bar Chanah (that the allowance is Bichdei Man).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the word Man come to refer to meals?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk in Daniel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why only restrict the purchase of an Esrog, the Lulav should have the same problem!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Lulav does not have Kedushas Shevi'is since the Lulav cut for Sukos is from the sixth year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Esrog picked then is also, surely, from the sixth year!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The status of the Esrog is determined by the date in which it was picked.</p></div>
