<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can Rabah bar bar Chanah hold that, according to R. Yochanan, the Berachah over Lulav is one day and over Sukah is seven, given that we have a Beraisa which teaches the opposite!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Upon making one's own Lulav one recites Shehechiyanu, and Al Netilas Lulav <i>each day</i> of its use.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Upon making one's own Sukah one recites Shehechiyanu, and Leshev ba'Sukah is recited <i>once</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This contradicts Rabah bar bar Chanah both regarding Lulav and Sukah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The problem of Lulav may be addressed by assuming that the Beraisa is speaking in the Mikdash (Lulav all seven days is d'Oraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Sukah remains a contradiction!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Berachah over Sukah is a Machlokes Tanaim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> One recited the Berachah over Tefilin each time during the day one dons them (even though the Chiyuv has not been interrupted, like Sukah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> Only one Berachah (in the morning).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Abaye decided in favor of Rebbi and Rava in favor of Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Mari b.bas Shmuel reported that Rava acted in accordance with Rebbi (Berachah each time).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We act in accordance with Rebbi regarding Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Mar Zutra reported that R. Papi acted like Rebbi and that the students of R. Ashi's Yeshiva recited a Berachah each time they felt (checked) their Tefilin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The Berachah over Lulav is recited daily.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua b. Levi):</span> Only the first day (d'Oraisa outside the Mikdash) gets a Berachah, after which it is Mitzvas Zekeinim (no Berachah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Every day is Mitzvas Zekeinim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the first day is d'Oraisa!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We mean, except the first day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then R. Yitzchak is the same as R. Yehosua b. Levi (yet he appears to be stating a differing opinion)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant to support R. Yehoshua b. Levi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rav also holds (like Shmuel) that the Berachah is daily.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is learned from R. Chiya citing Rav regarding Neiros Chanukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We may infer from Chanukah which is d'Rabanan to the remaining days of Lulav.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> If one does not light Neiros Chanukah he makes a Berachah when seeing the Neiros of another Jew.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The details of such Berachos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Berachah does he make?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Asher...Tzivanu LeHadlik Ner Shel Chanukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did Hash-m command this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The command to listen to the Chachamim (Lo Sasur).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman b. Yitzchak):</span> From She'al Avichah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman b. Yitzchak):</span> Rav taught the ruling regarding Lulav explicitly (no need to infer it from Chanukah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHE'HECHEYANU ON THE SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One who makes a Sukah recites Shehechiyanu.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One who uses his Sukah recited Leshev ba'Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If there is something to add or modify to an existing Sukah he recited Shehechiyanu at that time; otherwise it waits until the first use (two Berachos then).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> R. Kehana would recite both over Kidush.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE BERACHAH OVER SIMULTANEOUS MITZVOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>When performing several Mitzvos together one recites Al ha'Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> One recites a Berachah over each one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira or R. Chanina b. Papa):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's rationale?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk, Baruch Hash-m Yom Yom (as analyzed).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>OTHER TEACHINGS OF R. ZEIRA OR R. CHANINA BAR PAPA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Hash-m is unlike man regarding filling an empty vessel versus filling a full one.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One who is accustomed to listening (is full) hears more (may be further filled) as indicated by the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Alternately, one who reviews what he has learned hears news, unlike one who gives up on reviewing (which is considered Mefaneh Libo L'Vatalah - see Rashi).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>EATING THE ESROG AFTER COMPLETING THE MITZVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Esrog remains prohibited the entire seventh day, and is permitted on the eighth, whereas Sukah remains prohibited even on the eighth day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> Esrog is permitted even on the seventh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is their Machlokes?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Resh Lakish holds that the Esrog is only designated for its Mitzvah; R. Yochanan holds that the designation applies to the whole day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Resh Lakish to R. Yochanan):</span> But our Mishnah allows eating the Esrog of the children, and, presumably, those of the adults, as well!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, only those of the children (see Rashi).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate rendition of the above steps: Question (R. Yochanan to Resh Lakish):</span> But our Mishnah only permits the Esrogim of children, presumably those of the adults would be prohibited!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, those of the adults are permitted, and those of children are mentioned only as a common illustration.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Papa):</span> Why is Sukah (according to R. Yochanan) different than Esrog?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Unlike Esrog, Sukah has use Bein ha'Shemashos and thus becomes Muktzeh all day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Levi):</span> The Esrog is indeed Muktzeh all of the eighth day (like Sukah), since it was Muktzeh Bein ha'Shemashos, given the doubt regarding the day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Avuha d'Shmuel):</span> The Esrog is permitted on the eighth.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Avuha d'Shmuel later rescinded his position in favor of Levi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>However, R. Zeira put forth the original view of Avuha d'Shmuel (only prohibiting on the seventh).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>TWO MORE TEACHINGS OF R. ZEIRA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One should not give the Minim to a minor before fulfilling one's Mitzvah on the first day (since they may acquire it but cannot give it back).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One should fulfill one's promises to a child lest they learn to falsify.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>THE <i>MACHLOKES</i> R. YOCHANAN AND RESH LAKISH (resumed)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav and R. Asi argue over the same question (if the Esrog is Muktzeh for its Mitzvah or for the day).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> If one designates an Esrog for each day of Sukos, it may be eaten right after the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> It may be eaten only the next day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Asi learns like Resh Lakish and Rav like R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>AN ESROG ON THE EIGHTH DAY OUTSIDE OF ERETZ YISRAEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the status of the Esrog outside of Eretz Yisrael on the eighth day?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is prohibited, given the doubt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mereimar):</span> It is permitted, in spite the doubt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>After reporting differing practices, the Halachah is like Abaye.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>THE SUKAH ON THE EIGHTH DAY OUTSIDE OF ERETZ YISRAEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav, cited by R. Yehudah bar R. Shmuel b. Shilas):</span> While one must reside in the Sukah on the eighth (which may be the seventh) day, one mentions Shemini Atzeres in his Tefilos, not Sukos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is the eighth day in all regards.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>They are arguing over reciting a Berachah over the Sukah on the eighth day (if it is the eighth in all regards then a Berachah is not said), but they both agree that one must reside in the Sukah on the eighth day.</p></div>
