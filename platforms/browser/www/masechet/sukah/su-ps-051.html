<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SHIRAH AS PRIMARILY WITH THE MOUTH OR WITH INSTRUMENTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> This is a Machlokes Tanaim as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> The Avadim of the Kohanim played.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Yisraelim of specific families played.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina b. Antignus):</span> Levi'im played.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Seemingly, R. Meir (who allows Avadim to play) must hold that Shirah is with the mouth, while R. Chanina must hold that Shirah is primarily with a Kli (thus Levi'im would need to play).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then what is R. Yosi's position?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Shirah is b'Feh, Avadim should be permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Shirah is b'Kli, Levi'im should be required!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shirah is with the mouth and the Machlokes is over what actually happened (who played).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Halachic difference does it make?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It will affect the assumptions we make about people on the Duchan regarding Ma'aser and Yuchsin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Avadim were on the Duchan, then no assumptions can be made regarding either Yuchsin or Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Yisraelim, then infer Yuchsin but not Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If Levi'im, then infer both.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE ARGUMENT BETWEEN R. YOSI B'REBBI YEHUDAH AND RABANAN (resumed)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah b. Aba):</span> They argued only whether the Chalil was Docheh Shabbos for Simchas Beis ha'Sho'evah (R. Yosi b. Yehudah) or not (Rabanan).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>All would permit the Chalil for the Shir of the Korban, which is actually Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (on R. Yosef who, on 50b, taught that R. Yosi concurs with Chachamim that Shir of Simchas Beis ha'Sho'evah is not Docheh Shabbos [while the Shir of Korban is a Machlokes]):</span> The Beraisa teaches that, according to R. Yosi b. Yehudah, the Shir of Simchas Beis ha'Sho'evah <i>is</i> Docheh Shabbos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refutes R. Yosef.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We may infer from this Beraisa that the Machlokes is <i>only</i> regarding Shir of Beis ha'Sho'evah, and that all agree to permit Shir of Korban (refuting the premise R. Yosef that this is a Machlokes)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue regarding both Shir, but they single out Beis ha'Sho'evah to teach the extent of R. Yosi's permission (even Beis ha'Sho'evah is Docheh Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But our Mishnah teaches that Chalil of <i>Beis ha'Sho'evah</i> is not Docheh Shabbos (implying that the Shir of Korban <i>is</i> Docheh Shabbos)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The author of this statement cannot be R. Yosi b. Yehudah (who holds that Beis ha'Sho'evah is Docheh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It must be Rabanan, thus refuting R. Yosef!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosef is thus refuted on two counts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The basis for Shira being primarily b'Kli is the Pasuk Vayomer Chizkiyahu... (Divrei ha'Yamim II:29).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>The basis for Shira b'Feh is Vayehi k'Echad (ibid:5).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then what of the Pasuk Vayomer...?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is understood as Shirah starting b'Feh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will Vayehi be understood by those who hold Shirah b'Kli?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The singers in the Pasuk are compared to the trumpeters in that they used Kelim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE GREAT SIMCHAS BEIS HASHOEVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It was an incomparable Simchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>After the first Yom Tov the Kohanim and Levi'im would descend to the Ezras Nashim to make the Tikun Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>There were golden Menoros with four ladders reaching the four receptacles on top of each Menorah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Young Kohanim would bring 120 Lugim of oil into each Sefel, and worn Bigdei Kehunah would be cut for wicks.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The light illuminated every courtyard in Yerushalayim</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">51b----------------------------------------51b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Great men danced and juggled torches and sang praises.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Levi'im played all manner of instruments while standing on the 15 steps down to the Ezras Nashim (representing the 15 Shir ha'Ma'alos in Tehilim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Two Kohanim trumpeters blew from above the steps at daybreak, descended to the tenth step and blew again, continuing until the eastern gate of the Ezras Nashim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>They turned westward (back upon the Mikdash) and proclaimed that our ancestors angered Hash-m while our eyes turn only to Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>According to R. Yehudah, they repeated Anu l'Kah...</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>INCOMPARABLE EVENTS</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Yerushalayim was a uniquely beautiful city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Beis ha'Mikdash was uniquely magnificent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Mikdash?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mikdash built by Hordus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was its construction?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Green and white marble (alternately, blue and white marble).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Each successive row of stones was slightly recessed from the row below it, to properly retain the Sid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>The Rabanan discouraged Hordus from gold plating the walls.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah in the Beraisa):</span> The Beis ha'Keneses in Alexandria was a unique glory for the Jews at times holding 600,000 (some say twice that number of) Jews.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The building is described in detail, including the wooden Bimah in the middle where the Shamash would wave cloths to tell the masses to answer Amen.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why were they punished?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because they violated the prohibition of returning to Mitzrayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Alexander came there and inferred from the Torah reading, which foretold his miraculous arrival, that he was to carry out the punishment spoken of in that Parashah, and he did so.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What great thing was instituted?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They created a balcony for the women above, since the previous arrangements had led to levity.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But how could they add to the Mikdash, which must follow the plans laid out by the Pasuk!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> They learned a Kal va'Chomer from the separation mandated at the eulogy of Mashiach ben Yosef to the separation at the joyous occasions.</p></div>
