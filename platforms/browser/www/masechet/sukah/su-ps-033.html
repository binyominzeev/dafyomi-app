<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A HADAS LESS MOST OF ITS LEAVES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is it possible to have a Hadas which has lost most of its leaves yet the leaves still entirely cover the branch?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> A Hadas Mitzra'ah often has even seven leaves in one place, such that even if four fall off, it still qualifies as Avos with the remaining three.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This indicates that the Hadas Mitzra'ah is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is that not obvious (since it is a Hadas)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have forbidden it since it has a qualifier in its name.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then perhaps it should be invalidated!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The term Etz Avos allows for any type of Hadas.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A DRIED OUT HADAS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>As long as three moist leaves remain, the Hadas is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> They must be at the tip of the Hadas, not in the middle.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DICHUY FOR MITZVOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula b. Chinena):</span> A Tamarah which sprouted from the end of the cut tip of a Hadas renders it Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> What if the growth sprouted after Yom Tov had entered (such that its tip was cut when Yom Tov began)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Would we say that the Hadas has been Nidcheh from its ability to perform the Mitzvah, or not?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This can be answered by learning the Mishnah regarding Kisui ha'Dam where if the wind covered, and subsequently uncovered the Dam, one still has the Mitzvah to cover it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This seems to indicate Ein Dichuy by Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The very question of R. Yirmiyah was whether this case of Ein Dichuy generalizes to all cases, or whether that only applies when it would be a Chumrah (requiring him to cover the Dam) but not when it would result in a Kulah (allowing the newly-sprouted Hadas)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Teiku, the matter is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Could this be the Machlokes regarding a Hadas whose berries had been plucked on Yom Tov!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Tzadok disallows and Chachamim allow this Hadas to be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We are assuming that the Minim do not need to be bound in order to be used; or, even if they must be bound, there is no restriction of Ta'aseh v'Lo Min he'Asuy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They would then be arguing over whether there is Dichuy (R. Elazar, since it could not be used at the time it was bound with the other Minim) or not (Chachamim, that Mitzvah opportunities return).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, they may agree to Ein Dichuy, but argue whether we derive from Sukah the restriction of Ta'aseh v'Lo Min he'Asuy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> They would certainly learn from Sukah, but they are arguing over whether the Minim must be bound together (the Chachamim hold that a Lulav is Kosher even if not bound, and R. Yehudah holds that it must be bound to be Kosher).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's rationale?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Gezeirah Shavah from the Eizov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will the Chachamim learn this connection?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They do not have a tradition to learn this Gezeirah Shavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It seems that neither of these Tanaim would have taught that it is a Mitzvah to bind them, but it is not Me'akev, yet we find this in the Beraisa?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is the Chachamim, and the requirement is to beautify the Mitzvah, but is not Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>A HADAS WITH MORE BERRIES THAN LEAVES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda citing Rav with great reverence):</span> This Pesul only applies if the berries are clustered in one part of the Hadas, but not if they are spread over two or three places on the Hadas.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> But such spread-out berries makes the Hadas appear Menumar (leopard-like) and is Pasul!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav actually qualified the Mishnah by saying that the Pesul applies only if the berries are black, not if they are green.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> Red berries are like black ones (we see by Dam Nidah that black is the extension of red).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p><i>DICHUY</i> FOR <i>MITZVOS</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The berries must have been plucked off the Hadas after they were bound to the Lulav (since if they were plucked prior, the permission to use them would be obvious), and the permission to use them should teach us that there is no Dichuy for Mitzvos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah speaks of their being plucked after they were bound, but before Yom Tov began, and Hazmanah (as the binding is viewed as Hazmanah) is not a cutoff point for readiness regarding the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>NIR'EH V'NIDCHEH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>While the Mishnah prohibits plucking the berries on Yom Tov, it implies that were one to do so, the Hadas would be Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Upon analysis, we should be able to derive several Halachos from this implication.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the berries blackened before Yom Tov then the permission to use such a Hadas (plucked on Yom Tov) should prove Ein Dichuy!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the berries blackened on Yom Tov (such that the Hadas was Kosher when Yom Tov entered, but became Pasul when the berries blackened, and is now restored to its Kashrus by the berries being plucked), then we should prove that Nir'ah v'Nidcheh may be Nir'ah once again!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You may prove Ein Dichuy, but not Nir'ah v'Nidcheh.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>DAVAR SH'EIN MISKAVEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> One may not pluck the berries on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Citing R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> One may do so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that is Mesaken on Yom Tov (rendering it fit for use)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> He plucked the berries to eat, and R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Shimon holds (like his father) that Davar Sh'Ein Miskaven is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Abaye and Rava taught that R. Shimon never permitted a Davar Sh'Ein Miskaven when it is a P'sik Reisha!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We permit the plucking where he has other Hadasim with which to be Yotzei the Mitzvah, (he is not rendering this one fit for use).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>TYING ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If the binding unties on Yom Tov he must wind the binding around and tuck it in (not tying it at all).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not make a bow (which will last better and is not considered Keshirah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is R. Yehudah who views a bow as forbidden tying.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Beraisa is R. Yehudah (who also holds that the Torah obligates the binding of the Minim) then simply wrapping the binding around is insufficient!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The author of this Beraisa agrees with R. Yehudah on one point (forbidding a bow) but disagrees on another (whether the Torah obligates the binding).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE ARAVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A stolen or dried out Aravah is Pesulah, as well as one from Asheirah, Ir ha'Nidachas, one whose tip was cut off, whose leaves (in the majority) have fallen, and the Tzaftzefah (whose leaves are round).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If it is Kemushah (not fully dried out, or if a minority of its leaves have fallen off or it grows in a (Ba'al) field (not by a river), it is Kesheirah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>ARVEI NACHAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>This teaches that it must grow by a river.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Alternately, its leaves are elongated, like a river (and must not be round, like the Tzaftzefah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama of another Beraisa):</span> The plural use of Arvei that teaches the Aravos of a field (not by a river) may be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Aba Shaul):</span> The plural refers to the Aravah of the Lulav and that of the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence will the Tana Kama learn the obligation of surrounding the Mizbe'ach with Aravah in the Mikdash?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is one of three Halachos l'Moshe mi'Sinai reported by R. Asi citing R. Yochanan.</p></div>
