<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>OTHER HALACHOS REGARDING RESIDING IN THE SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Cups which are not unseemly may remain in the Sukah after their use, but dishes, earthenware and wood water vessels should be removed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rava allowed the earthenware lamp to remain, while Yesh Omrim say that it must be removed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>They are not arguing, but teaching a Halachah which depends on the size of the Sukah (if there is ample room for the lamp to remain).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>EXEMPTION DUE TO RAINFALL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>He is exempt if the porridge would spoil, a dish which is readily spoiled by even a small amount of rain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Abaye asked R. Yosef why he was exempting himself due to wind which was dropping bits of Sechach onto his food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yosef taught him that since he is very particular, this constitutes the state of 'spoiled porridge' for him.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE REQUIREMENT TO RETURN AFTER THE RAIN STOPS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One who is forced out of the Sukah due to rain need not go back up to the Sukah until he is done with his meal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Similarly, he may sleep until 'Yaor.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Yaor mean (with an Ayin) until he wakes up (and he would then have to go back up, even during the night) or does it mean (with an Aleph) that he needs to go back up only once the sun rises?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa teaches that he may remain until light, and the Amud ha'Shachar arrives.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But those are contradictory times!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should read until (both) he wakes up and Amud ha'Shachar arrives.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>RAIN IS ANALOGOUS TO THE SERVANT...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who spilled the water in the analogy (the servant, indicative of our carelessness) or the Master (indicative of Hash-m's displeasure with our service)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> The Master spilled it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>OTHER NEGATIVE INDICATIONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The sun being obscured is a bad omen for the world (analogous to a King who turned out the lights on the meal he provided for his servants).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> The affliction of the celestial lights is a bad sign to those who are accustomed to affliction (the Jews, who have so much potential, and, by analogy, the student who is regularly hit is more concerned with the teacher's staff).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The affliction of the sun is bad for the gentiles while that of the moon is bad for the Jews (who count their calendar by the moon).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Similarly, the position of the sun when it is afflicted indicates the bad sign for those in that direction.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The color of the afflicted sun indicates the nature of the bad omen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The timing (at sunrise or at sunset) indicates whether the bad tidings are close or further in coming (may be understood either way).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>When a People is afflicted, its god is afflicted, as we learn from the Pasuk describing the affliction of Egypt and its gods.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>When the Jews do Hash-m's will, they can leave all the worrying about these matters to the Gentiles.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>AVEIROS WHICH BRING AFFLICTIONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Four Aveiros cause the sun to be afflicted (as listed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Four Aveiros cause the property of homeowners to be turned over to the government (as listed).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Four Aveiros cause the property of homeowners to be lost (as listed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The worst (and causal) offence is a haughty spirit.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK LULAV HA'GAZUL</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>MISHNAH: PESULIM OF A LULAV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A stolen or dried out Lulav is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If it is destined to be burned, as in the case of an Asheirah tree or an Ir ha'Nidachas, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If the head of the Lulav is cut off, or if its leaves severed from its spine, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> If its leaves spread away from its spine it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> They should be tied above.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Lulavim grown in hard rocky mountains (with short leaves) are Kosher (as long as one leaf reaches the one after it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>A Lulav which has three Tefachim, in addition to the one needed to shake it, is Kosher.</p></div>
