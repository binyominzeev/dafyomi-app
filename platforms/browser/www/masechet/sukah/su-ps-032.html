<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CUT OFF TOP OF THE LULAV (NIKTAM ROSHO)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> While if the top is cut off it is Pasul, if they are slit it is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa invalidates slit (together with bowing, thorny, bent like a sickle and hardened [but allows nearly hardened]) leaves of the Lulav!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> The Pesul is Himnik, where the slit in the top actually creates a 'V' or quill effect.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BENT LIKE A SICKLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This Pesul refers to a bend forward, not back to its spine (which is Kosher) the way it grows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Nachman considers bent to the side like bent forward, others cite him saying it is like backward.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If all the leaves are to one side of the spine it is blemished and Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>NIFRETZU AND NIFREDU</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> Nifretzu is where, like a sweep broom, the severed leaves are gathered and tied at their base to the spine of the Lulav; while Nifredu is where the base is still attached to the spine but the ends have fanned out from the Lulav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Papa):</span> What is the Halachah if the center leaves (the Tiyomes, or extension of the spine) split from one another.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua b. Levi taught that if the Tiyomes were removed the Lulav is Pasul, which, presumably, would extend to our Nechlakah case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Not necessarily, since removal of the leaves creates Chaser, a greater alteration than Nechlakah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate rendition of R. Yehoshua b. Levi:</span> Nechlakah is like the removal of the Tiyomes and it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>BINDING THE LEAVES TOGETHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yehudah learns this from Kafus which implies that if it were separated one must bind it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>DEFINING THE KAPOS TEMARIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina of R. Ashi):</span> Perhaps it is the Charusa (a Lulav after the hardening of its spine and leaves)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It cannot be bound (Kafos) due to it hardness.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is the Ufsa (bark without leaves)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must have a bindable quality, not fixed as bound.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is the Kufra (not as thick as the Charusa and still bindable)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The pleasant Torah would not have us use that which scratches the hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava Tosfa'ah of Ravina):</span> Perhaps it is two Machbedim (the fan shaped twig holding the clusters of dates)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The word Kafos is written as though singular.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then take just one?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is called a Kaf (and Kafos refers to the binding).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>TZINEI HAR HA'BARZEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This Lulav is Pasul if the lower leaf does not reach the base of the leaf above it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is supported by the Beraisa which invalidates the Tzinei Har ha'Barzel, which must refer to one which Abaye would disqualify (or else it would contradict our Mishnah).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Alternately, the above discussion was started with the apparent contradiction, and Abaye's qualification is its resolution.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>These two trees are located in Gei Ben Hinom near Yerushalayim, at the entrance to Gehinom.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>THE SHIUR OF A LULAV IS THREE TEFACHIM TO SHAKE IT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The Shiur of the Hadas and Aravah is three Tefachim and the Lulav must be four, to extend a Tefach above the Hadasim and Aravos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Parnach citing R. Yochanan):</span> The <i>spine</i> of the Lulav must extend that Tefach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah only requires three Tefachim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means three Tefachim and that which is needed to shake it, which is the Machlokes above.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa requires the Lulav to be four Tefachim (with the Hadas and Aravah being three), which would seem to be with its leaves (like Shmuel)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means four Tefachim without the leaves.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In the above cited Beraisa, the Tana Kama requires the Hadas to be three and R. Tarfon says that it is an Amah of five Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Who can find a leaf-covered Hadas of three Tefachim, to say nothing of <i>five</i>!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Dimi):</span> R. Tarfon meant that the three Tefachim are measured by dividing a six-Tefach Amah by five parts, only adding a bit to the Shiur of the Tana Kama.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Shmuel is here cited as holding that the Hadas must be three, yet he is cited as holding like R. Tarfon whose Shiur is three and three-fifths!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel was being approximate when he said three.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we only attribute imprecision to the statement when it is more stringent!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravin):</span> R. Tarfon meant to be more lenient and to use a five-Tefach Amah and divide it by six, resulting in a two and one-half Tefach Hadas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Shmuel is still inconsistent!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This inconsistency can be attributed to his imprecision, which is a Chumrah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE PESULIM OF A HADAS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Pesulim include a Hadas which is stolen, dried out, from an Asheirah or Ir ha'Nidachas, a clipped top, fallen leaves or whose berries exceed its leaves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the excess berries are removed it is Kosher, but this repair may not be done on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>DEFINING THE ANAF ETZ AVOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A branch whose leaves cover it, the Hadas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is the olive tree?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not Avos, with the leaves laying upon one another.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is the Dulva?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Its leaves to not cover the entire branch.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is the Hirdof?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The pleasant Torah would not have us use that which scratches the hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A poisonous plant is inconsistent with 'the love of Truth and Peace.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> That which is woven (one leaf upon the other) like a chain, that is the Hadas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer b. Yakov):</span> It is the tree whose branch and fruit (or leaves) is identical, namely, the Hadas.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>MESHULASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It was taught that Avos demands that it be Meshulash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What qualifies as Avos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah):</span> Three leaves from one point.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Kehana):</span> Two from one point and one from a point below resting on the other two also qualifies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Out of respect for his Rebbi, R. Acha would seek Hadasim like R. Kehana said.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar b. Ameimar):</span> My father called such a Hadas a Shoteh (since it seemed to lack clear direction).</p></div>
