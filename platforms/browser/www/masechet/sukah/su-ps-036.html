<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A HOLE IS PASUL WHEN SOME FLESH OF THE ESROG IS MISSING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula b. Chanina):</span> If the hole runs through the Esrog, the Esrog is Pasul with the loss of a Mashehu; if it is not that deep it is KeIsar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is the Din if the Esrog develops symptoms akin to the Tereifos of an animal?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Anything to which Rava might be referring has already been taught (as Kosher or Pasul) in a Mishnah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava is asking about the application of the Din of Ula citing R. Yochanan regarding the liquified flesh around the lung.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yochanan ruled the animal still Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Rava qualified this ruling as applying only when their are still intact Symponin.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>In the parallel case of Esrog, the flesh is liquefied but the seeds (equivalent to the blood vessels in the lungs) are still intact.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>Rava's question is whether we view the fact that the Esrog is exposed to air (unlike the lung cavity) as rendering it already rotten, or does it not make a difference.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn in the Beraisa that a Tafuach and Saruach are among the listed Pesulim of the Esrog.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely the Saruach is our case where the skin (and area around the seeds) is intact but the flesh is rotten.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We see, then, that Rava's case is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>No indication may be drawn from that Beraisa since both Tafuach and Saruach may refer to external features which may exist exclusively of one another.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ESROG HA'KUSHI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Among the listed Pesulim (in 1.c. above) is the Esrog Kushi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But our Mishnah taught that it is Kosher, while one which is <i>similar</i> to a Kushi is Pasul!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah means to invalidate an Esrog similar to a Kushi (ie. a black Esrog found outside of Kush, where black is not normal, is Pasul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We are speaking of an actual Esrog from Kush which would be Kosher in Babel (its proximity to Kush makes a Kush Esrog common there) while in Eretz Yisrael it would be Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AN ESROG THAT IS BOSER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>In the above-cited Beraisa there is a Machlokes whether an Esrog ha'Boser is Pasul (R. Akiva) or Kosher (Chachamim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> R. Akiva and R. Shimon are of one opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva as cited.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon exempts tiny Esrogim from Ma'aser (presumably for the same reason as R. Akiva, that they are not considered a fruit and lack Hadar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Akiva may not be of one mind with R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva may invalidate the unripe Esrog because of its lack of Hadar, but may agree with Chachamim regarding its qualification for Ma'aser (since it may, after all, be eaten)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Alternately, R. Shimon may have exempted it from Ma'aser inferring this from the Pasuk (that to be obligated the fruit must be fit for use as a seed) but hold like Chachamim regarding Esrog.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Thus the opinions of R. Akiva and R. Shimon may not be equated.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>AN ESROG GROWN INTO A MOLD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa above invalidates an Esrog which was shaped by the form placed around it during its growth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This holds only if the mold forces it into a new shape, not if it is in the shape of an Esrog.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is obvious, the Beraisa itself mentions the new shape as the source of invalidation!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need Rava's Din to permit the case where the form made the Esrog look like a series of slats connected in the shape of an Esrog.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>CHASER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> An Esrog which was bitten by mice lacks Hadar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Chanina would eat some of his Esrog and then use it for the Mitzvah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will R. Chanina understand the Mishnah which invalidates a Chaser?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chanina was speaking on Yom Tov Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mice make a worse Hadar problem than simple Chaser (and would be Pasul even on the second day).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Alternate rendition of the above:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> An Esrog bitten by mice is still Hadar, as supported by R. Chanina's practice.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will R. Chanina understand the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He permits the Chaser on Yom Tov Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>A SMALL ESROG</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rafram b. Papa):</span> The Machlokes regarding Esrog is the same as the one regarding the size of stones used for sanitary purposes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>There, too, R. Meir allows the carrying of stones up to the size of an Egoz and R. Yehudah allows until an egg.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>A LARGE ESROG</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yosi supported his allowing a very large Esrog by reporting the incident wherein R. Akiva arrived with his huge Esrog slung on his shoulder.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> That is not a support since the Rabbis corrected R. Akiva there (pointing out that it is not Hadar)!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>MISHNAH: BINDING THE MINIM WITH THE MINIM THEMSELVES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The Minim must be bound with the Minim themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> Any string is adequate, as supported by the people of Yerushalayim who would use gold thread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> They would tie them with Minim underneath the adornment.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>IGUD USING OTHER MATERIALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Any material from the Minim, even the least significant (such as Siv), is adequate for R. Yehudah, who does not require Hadar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The rationale of R. Yehudah is his requirement that the Minim be bound, thus lending significance to the binding material which, if another material is used, would introduce a fifth Min.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> I learn the inclusion of Siv as a type of Lulav material from the implication of this Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> Any vegetation may be used (as derived from the Pasuk).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The Sechach must be made only of the leaves of the Minim, (from a Kal va'Chomer).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> Any Kal va'Chomer which results in a Kulah (since one who cannot find Sechach of the Minim would be without a Sukah) may not be learned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rather, any vegetation may be used, as seen clearly from the Pasuk in Nechemiah wherein Ezra tells the People to bring various leaves in addition to the Minim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The other vegetation were meant for the walls, and the leaves of the Minim were meant for the Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Now we know from the Mishnah that R. Yehudah permits planks as Sechach, which must be the planks of wood from the trees of the Minim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>Hence we know that even Siv (which is part of the palm tree) is Kosher!</p></div>
