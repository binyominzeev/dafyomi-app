<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: SUKAH YESHANAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> A previously built Sukah is Pesulah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> It is Kesheirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A Sukah is Yeshanah if built 30 days before Sukos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>It is Kesheirah, however, if it was built LeShem Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BEIS SHAMAI AND BEIS HILLEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Beis Shamai's rationale?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk (Vayikra 23:34) indicates that the Chag and the Sukah must be LeShem Mitzvas Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will Beis Hillel interpret that Pasuk?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches the Din of R. Sheshes citing R. Akiva (explained by R. Yehudah b. Beseira) that it is forbidden to make personal use of the Sukah boards for seven days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Pasuk must teach this Din according to Beis Shamai, as well (so how can it also teach Lishmah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Beis Shamai interpret Devarim 16:13 to teach that the Sukah must be made Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will Beis Hillel understand that Pasuk?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It permits constructing a Sukah during Chol ha'Moed (unlike Beis Shamai who prohibit making a Sukah for less than all seven days).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do Beis Hillel (who do not require Lishmah) disagree with R. Yehudah citing Rav that Tzitzis need to be made Lishmah (and, presumably, fashioning all Mitzvos)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah cited Rav as teaching that Tzitzis must be affixed to the garment Lishmah, and not be made from residual threads from the weaving of the garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>While Shmuel argues with Rav (as pointed out when R. Yehudah cited this Din before him) regarding the actual spinning of the Tzitzis threads Lishmah, the issue of affixing them Lishmah is not under dispute!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tzitzis is unique, due to Lecha (in Devarim 22:12).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Lecha appears by Sukah, as well (ibid. 16:13)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Lecha there prohibits the use of a stolen Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then Lecha should teach the same by Tzitzis (not the Din of Lishmah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The word LaHem (in Bamidbar 15:38) already taught Gezulah by Tzitzis (freeing Lecha to teach Lishmah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: DIFFERENTIATING A ROOF FROM SECHACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Sukah built under a tree is (Pesulah) as though it were built indoors.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> If a Sukah were built above another, only the upper one is Kesheirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> If the roof/floor between them is not fit for residence, then the lower Sukah is Kesheirah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>A SUKAH UNDER A TREE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This Pesul only applies if the shade of the tree is greater than its light.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence do we know this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the Mishnah's comparing it to a Sukah built indoors (and not simply stating that it is Pesulah), it must share this quality with the indoors (shade more than light).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But even if the density is less, the tree still creates a mixture of Sechach Pasul with Kasher (since even the limited density of the tree contributes to the Sechach below, and should thus invalidate it)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> He lowered an mixed the tree's branches with the Kosher Sechach, such that it is Batel b'Rov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Rava was speaking where he had mixed the Sechach, then it is <i>obvious</i> that it is not Pasul!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have thought to prohibit a case of mixed Sechach lest he come to permit such Sechach even when not mixed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the fact that we do not make such a Gezeirah is clear from the later Mishnah, which permits using Gefen, etc. for Sechach, provided that the Kosher Sechach is in the majority, and, by implication, it is mixed!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might, from that Mishnah, inferred that the use of such Sechach is only b'Di'eved (an impression which our Mishnah thus comes to correct).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>A SUKAH ABOVE A SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa derives the prohibition of one Sukah above another from Vayikra 23:42 (the singular spelling [Kesiv] of Sukos teaches that a Sukah may have only one Sechach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the plural word (Sukos as read [Kri]) indicates the opposite!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman b. Yitzchak):</span> We must take into account the singular form in which it is written.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yirmiyah teaches that there are illustrations where:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Both the upper and lower Sukos are Kesheiros.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Both are Pesulos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The lower is Kesheirah and the upper is Pesulah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The lower is Pesulah and the upper is Kesheirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Gemara gives an illustration for each of the cases of R. Yirmiyah, supplying the details of which Sukah had adequate Sechach, and which had inadequate Sechach; likewise which Sechach was within 20 Amos and which was above.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But these are <i>obvious</i> applications of known Halachos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The cases are justified because we might have prohibited a Sukah which R. Yirmiyah permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The case wherein the lower Sechach was Kesheirah (more shade than light), and the upper was Pesulah (less shade than light, within 20 Amos) is acceptable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We might have thought to prohibit it given that if the upper Sukah were above 20 Amos, its Sechach is Pesulah, based on its height, regardless of the fact that it is here Pesulah owing to its sparsity.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the lower Sukah relies on the sparse Sechach of such an upper Sechach, it would be combining Kosher and Pasul Sechach, thus invalidating the lower Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>A case where the upper Sechach is similarly Pesulah owing to its sparsity could, perhaps, be deemed Pasul lest it be confused with the case where the upper Sechach is above 20.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Yirmiyah is thus teaching that we do not impose such a Gezeirah.</p></div>
