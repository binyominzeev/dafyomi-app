<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>RAVA'S INTERPRETATION OF THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A large mat is normally meant for Sechach (but if made for sleeping is Mekabel Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> An undesignated small mat is subject to Tum'ah and is Pasul for Sechach</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> Both a small and a large mat are Kosher for Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> The language of R. Eliezer in the Mishnah implies that the large is like the small, not the reverse (a Tana normally mentions the obvious case first, and then the case that he is learning from it)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Second Question (Abaye):</span> It seems clear that R. Eliezer is the Machmir position (as implied in the Beraisa)!?</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>R. PAPA'S INTERPRETATION OF THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> All agree that an undesignated small mat is for lying on, and they argue about a large mat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> As we understood before, an undesignated large mat is for Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> A large mat is also for lying on (and may not be used).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then what did R. Eliezer mean when he spoke of a mat made for Shechivah (imply- ing that this is not its assumed state)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant that its undesignated use is li'Shechivah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ANOTHER BERAISA ON MATS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> Large mats made of soft grasses may be used as Sechach, while small mats of the same material are presumed to be made for sleeping.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Those made of harder rushes are Kosher if twisted (and thus are thick and lumpy) but if woven (are smooth enough to sleep on and) are not Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Small rush mats, even when they are twisted are not Kosher for Sechach, because they are fit for sleeping on (small <i>reed</i> mats are Kosher when they are twisted, their leniency deriving from their being hard).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi citing his father):</span> All of the harder rushes may be used as Sechach, even if woven.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Dosa cited R. Yosi the same way.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But elsewhere we find R. Dosa holding not like R. Yosi and considering such a mat as Tameh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Dosa declares Chotzelos to be Kelim and subject to becoming Tameh.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>They become a Rishon, but not an Av (through the appropriate contact with a Zav, which they would be if they were Tamei Medras).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The Chachamim say that they are <i>even</i> subject to becoming Tameh Medras (and whatever can become a Medras, will become a Rishon, should it touch an ordinary Av).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avdimi b. Hamduri):</span> Chotzelos are the leather satchels of shepherds.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> Chotzelos are mats.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Resh Lakish spoke in reverence about R. Chiya (Hareini Kaparas R. Chiya u'Vanav).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This is because Ezra, Hillel and R. Chiya each came from Bavel to reinstate Torah in Eretz Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Dosa and the Chachamim agree about the mats of Usha (Tameh) and those of Teveriah (Tahor) and they argue about whether people normally sit on the other mats of the world.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Thus, according to Resh Lakish, R. Dosa declares mats to be Tameh!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is speaking of a mat which has a raised lip around it (making it a Kli) while we are speaking of a flat mat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In another Beraisa, R. Dosa teaches that Chotzelos are subject to Tumas Mes (not Medras, while the Chachamim add Medras).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is understandable according to R. Avdimi b. Hamduri.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One might use a satchel made of rushes for large fruit, and one made of sack-cloth or horse-hair for legumes and smaller fruit.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This is due to the difference in the way they are woven (with or without large gaps in the weaving).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, according to Resh Lakish, once R. Dosa has taught that they are not made for sleeping, mats are useless!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They each have a use.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A mat made of sack-cloth or horse-hair might be used as a curtain or sifter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A mat made of rushes may serve as a cover for a beer-barrel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The above question and answer could also be reframed as a question on R. Avdimi (trying to discover the use of the sacks), while understanding the use of the mats according to Resh Lakish.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanayah citing an old man he met in Bavel):</span> One may use mats for Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehoshua, his uncle agreed with the old man.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Chisda added that this ruling would only apply to a mat that had no lip.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> The mats of the B'nei Mechuza would have been eligible for Sechach had they not had rims (a Beraisa supports this distinction).</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK HA'YASHEN</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: SLEEPING IN THE SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> One may not sleep underneath a bed in the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> It is permitted (a temporary Ohel cannot negate a permanent one) and supports his view from his experience.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Tavi, R. Gamliel's slave, once slept under a bed in a Sukah and R. Gamliel boasted that Tavi was a scholar, knowing the relevant Halachos (that one Ohel is Mevatel another and that slaves are exempt from Sukah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>We learn from R. Gamliel's statement that someone who sleeps under a bed in the Sukah has not fulfilled his obligation.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>SLEEPING UNDER A BED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But given that beds are less than 10 Tefachim off the ground, why would it be considered an interrupting Ohel?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah is speaking of a bed raised 10 Tefachim from the ground.</p></div>
