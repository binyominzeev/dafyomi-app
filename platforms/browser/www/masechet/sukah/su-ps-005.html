<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TEN TEFACH MINIMUM HEIGHT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this minimum?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Answer was given by Rav, R. Chanina, R. Yochanan and R. Chaviva.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is a tendency, throughout Moed, to substitute R. Yonasan for R. Yochanan when he is paired with R. Chaviva.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is due to the fact that R. Yonasan was the Ben Zug to R. Chaviva.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>They answered that the Aron was nine Tefachim (1.5 Amah), and its Kapores was an additional Tefach, and from above the Kapores Hash-m spoke with Moshe.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We were taught (R. Yosi) that the Shechinah does not enter the domain given over to Man, nor does Man (even Eliyahu and Moshe Rabeinu) enter the domain Above.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It then follows that a division between two things below (e.g. The Sukah and that which is beyond it) is created with a 10-Tefach divider.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find that the Shechinah <i>did</i> come down (on Har Sinai)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Shechinah hovered above 10 Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But in Zechariah we read that the Shechinah will rest (lit. place its feet) on Har ha'Zeisim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Again, that will be above 10 Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But at Har Sinai we read that Moshe <i>did</i> go up to the place of the Shechinah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beneath 10.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what of Eliyahu's stormy ascent to Shamayim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Again, beneath 10.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Pasuk in Iyov (26:9) is understood to mean that Hash-m protected Moshe from the Malachim, surely taking place in Shamayim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That, too, was below 10.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that Pasuk makes reference to Moshe grabbing the Kisei ha'Kavod!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kisei ha'Kavod came down within 10 for Moshe to grab.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE KAPORES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> While height of the Aron is clear from the Pasuk, whence that the Kapores was a Tefach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chanina infers from the Misgeres that it was a Tefach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The height, width and length of all the Kelim in the Mishkan are stated excepting the height of the Kapores, which must be inferred.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We deduce this from the minimum height recorded for any of the Kelim, the rim (Misgeres) around the Shulchan, which is a Tefach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Learn from Kelim themselves (all of which were taller than a Tefach) rather than from a <i>part</i> of a Kli?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Always adopt the minimum Chidush (Tafasta Merubah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then learn from the Tzitz, which was only two Etzbaos tall (the details of the Tzitz are described and debated in the cited Beraisa)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We derive the dimensions of a Kli from another (the rim), not a Kli from an adornment (the Tzitz).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Learn from the crown-edge (Zer) of the Aron, Mizbe'ach and on the Misgeres of the Shulchan (which was a Mashehu)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We derive the dimensions of a functional Kli from another Kli and not from a "touch" (Hechsher) of the Kli.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Misgeres was also a Hechsher!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Misgeres was integral in that it ran from leg to leg under the tabletop of the Shulchan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what of the opinion that the Misgeres was <i>above</i> the tabletop (it would seem to be a Hechsher)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we learn from the Misgeres (and not from the Tzitz or the Zer) because we derive the measurement of the Kapores whose (other) measurements are stated, from that whose measurements are stated (ie. the Misgeres, and not from that which has no stated measure [the Tzitz and Zer).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Huna):</span> We know that the Kapores was a Tefach because the Torah refers to it as having a Panim (a face is never less a Tefach).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then why not use the measure of a huge beast (with a <i>larger</i> face)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tafasta Merubah Lo Tafasta...(minimum Chidush).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then use the measure of a small-faced creature?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We link this Panim to the Panim of a person (Yitzchak Avinu) which is never less than a Tefach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not link it to the limitless Panim of P'nei Elokim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tafasta...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Learn from the Keruvim (which were on the Kapores and whose faces were less than a Tefach).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We have a tradition that the faces of the Keruvim were at least a Tefach.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Huna also derived his measurement based on this tradition.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Indeed, its name, Keruv, derives from the word (in Babylonian) for baby (Ravia) indicating that the face was like that of a baby.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Pasuk in Yechezkel (10:14) differentiates between the face of a person and the face of a Keruv!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is the child and one is the adult.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MORE ABOUT THE MINIMUM HEIGHT OF THE SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we derive the height of the Sukah from the Aron and Kapores, perhaps that includes the Sechach, as well (how do we know that the interior height must be 10 Tefachim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we learn the height of the Sukah from the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In both the Mikdash and Mishkan the Keruvim stood one- third the height of the building itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In the case of the Mishkan, this would make the Keruvim 10 Tefachim (they reached 20 Tefachim, a third of the 60 Tefach height of the Mishkan, less the 10 Tefach height of the Aron and Kapores, as above).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Keruvim are called "Sochechim," a reference to Sechach (assuming that the wings of the Keruvim are 10 Tefachim above the Kapores).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that their wings rose above the heads; perhaps the wings were level with the heads, and there was not the 10 Tefach open space beneath the Keruvim to derive a 10 Tefach interior Sukah height?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Acha b. Yakov):</span> The Pasuk says "above," implying above the heads.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they were further above the heads!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk says l'Ma'alah, not more than that.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This all works using the opinion of R. Meir (that the Amos of the Kelim of Mishkan were of six Tefachim as were the parts of the building), but what of R. Yehudah who holds that the Kelim (unlike the building) were made of five-Tefach Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Aron and Kapores then work out to 8.5 Tefachim, leaving the distance from the Kapores to the Keruvim of 11.5 Tefachim (still working with a third of the total 60-Tefach height of the Mishkan).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We would then have to make the minimum height of a Sukah 11.5 Tefachim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> According to R. Yehudah the source for a 10-Tefach minimum Sukah derives from Halachah l'Moshe mi'Sinai (as R. Chiya taught).</p></div>
