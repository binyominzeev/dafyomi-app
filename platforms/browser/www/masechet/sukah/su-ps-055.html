<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>R. ACHA AND THE <i>TEKI'OS</i> FOR EACH <i>MUSAF</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Bereisa cited by Rava b. Shmuel):</span> We are taught (based on uv'Roshei Chodsheichem) that we do <i>not</i> blow Teki'os on each Musaf!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refutes R. Acha.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does uv'Roshei Chodsheichem imply that we do not blow for each Musaf?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It teaches that all Roshei Chodoshim are alike, even if it falls on Shabbos with its additional Musaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> Chodsheichem (written singular) contrasts with Roshei (plural) to teach that the day with two "heads" ie. Rosh ha'Shanah, has one Teki'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (another Beraisa cited against R. Acha):</span> We see that only one Shir (and, by extension, one set of Teki'os) is said on Shabbos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This also refutes R. Acha.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Acha based himself in a Pasuk and a Beraisa!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The Beraisa (ha'Kol l'Fi ha'Musafin) teaches that we must extend the nine Teki'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabbis of Keisari citing R. Acha):</span> It teaches that there are more players when there are two Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>RECITING KORBANOS OUTSIDE OF ERETZ YISRAEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How are we to allocate the recitation of the Korbanos in Chutz La'Aretz (two days of Yom Tov)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The recitation of Day Two is omitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Day Seven is omitted, and a Beraisa supports Rava (we see that Yimotu is omitted).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Ameimar instituted in Naharda'a that the two (possible) days are mentioned on each day of Chol ha'Moed.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE ALLOCATION OF THE KORBANOS TO THE MISHMAROS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The formula for allocating the Korbanos to the 24 Mishmaros is given and applied to each day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Each day, one less Mishmar participates in the Parim-Eilim-Sair</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The 14 Kevasim are then divided into the remaining Mishmaros, with the maximum number of Mishmaros being given two Kevasim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Korbanos of Shemini Atzeres are allocated by lots.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Parim are allocated to those who had not yet offered them.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SHEMINI ATZERES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah (which seems to mandate lots between all the Mishmaros on Shemini Atzeres) appears to be the opinion of Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi allows that the Payis is among all the Mishmaros.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim maintain that only the two Mishmaros which had not received three Parim drew lots.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah does not necessarily mean that all the Mishamros were involved, since the remaining two Mishmaros also needed a Payis!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The statement which says that all but two Mishmaros received three Parim seems to be consistent with Rebbi (since according to Chachamim one of those two Mishmaros received the Korban Shemini Atzeres)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to those who did not receive a third during Sukos itself (not altogether).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Of what Chidush is this Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that the ones who received Parim one day did not do so the next day.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>SEVENTY AND ONE OFFERINGS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The 70 Parim are to atone for the 70 nations of the world.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The one Par of Shemini Atzeres is associated with the One Nation, alone (Mashal to the King...).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Nations don't know what they lost now that there is none to atone for them.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MISHNAH: ALLOCATING THE MATANOS AMONG THE MISHMAROS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>On the three Regalim all Mishmaros shared in all of the Matanos (including the Eimurei Regalim, the Lechem ha'Panim [Matzah] and the Shtei ha'Lechem [Chametz] on Shavuos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The one distributing the Lechem said, 'here is your Matzah, here is your Chametz.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Mishmar whose week falls on the Regel receives the Temidim, Nedarim, Nedavos and other Korbanos Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>That Mishmar offers everything.</p></div>
