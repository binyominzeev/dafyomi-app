<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>USING A KLI SHARES FOR THE WATER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we fill up a utensil which is not a Kli Shares before Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ze'iri):</span> Our Tana adopts two positions which would cause the water to become Kadosh in the Kli and subsequently be Pasul through Lina on Shabbos night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is no upper limit to the amount of water used for the Nisuch (hence the Kli Shares would be Mekadesh since the greater amount of water is still the "proper" amount for the Kli Shares).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Kli Shares is Mekadesh even unintentionally.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chizkiyah subscribes to the first position but says that the second position cannot be derived from our Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is possible that the Kli Shares may not be Mekadesh unintentionally.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, we could not use a Kli Shares owing to a Gezeirah lest these waters be confused with waters which were put in the Kli Shares intentionally.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yanai citing R. Zeira explains how the Mishnah could reject both the first and second position (ie. there <i>is</i> an upper limit to the amount of water, and that a Kli Shares is Mekadesh even unintentionally) and still prohibit this water lest people think it was drawn for Kidush Yadayim (which could be any amount).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MAYIM MEGULIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is exposed water Pasul for Nisuch given that it can be filtered from any venom!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah presumably rejects the position of R. Nechemyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He holds that we may rely on filtering to permit exposed wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even according to R. Nechemyah, this wine/water is Pasul for Nisuch owing to the stricter standard regarding bringing water to the Mizbe'ach than permitting such wine to a person.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK HE'CHALIL</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE CHALIL OF THE BEIS HA'SHO'EVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Chalil could be played for five or six days of Sukos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This refers to the Chalil of Simchas Beis ha'Sho'evah which does not override Shabbos or Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The text in some versions of the Mishnah was Beis "ha'Sho'evah"; in others it was Beis "ha'Chashuvah"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> There is a basis for either word, Sho'evah and Chashuvah, to appear in our Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Sho'evah derives from the Pasuk u'She'avtem.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chashuvah derives from the fact that the Shitin are very important, originating in Creation.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>CHALIL ON SHABBOS AND YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b. Yehudah):</span> Chalil overrides Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> It does not even override Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> The above Machlokes revolves around whether Shir is primarily with a Kli (the playing is Avodah) or primarily with one's mouth (the playing is not Avodah, and does not override).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>All would agree that Simchas Beis ha'Sho'evah is not Avodah, hence our Mishnah (that the Chalil does not override Shabbos or Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>R. YOSEF'S SOURCE FOR THE ARGUMENT BETWEEN R. YOSI AND CHACHAMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We find that Rebbi and R. Yosi b. Yehudah argue over the Kashrus of a wooden Kli Shares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Their argument seems to revolve around whether or not we infer from the wooden Chalil of Moshe Rabeinu to permit wooden Kelei Shares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This would seem to be based on whether Shir is primarily with a Kli (in which case we would learn from Moshe's Chalil) or by mouth (and the Chalil is not Avodah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>No, they could both hold that Shir is with a Kli and argue over whether we may apply a fixed source (Moshe's Chalil needed to be wood) to an unrestricted application (other Kelei Shares).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Alternately, they could both hold that Shir is with the mouth and that we do not learn from a fixed source and still argue whether Menorah informs other Kelim through Kelal u'Frat or Rov u'Miut.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi would learn Kelal u'Frat U'chlal (and all Kelim must be metal, akin to the Menorah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi would learn Rov u'Miut u'Rov (and Kelim may be made of any material except Cheres).</p></div>
