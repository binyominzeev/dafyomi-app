<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE <i>BERAISA </i>OF PEOPLES' JUDGMENTS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Jews and non-Jews who have sinned with their bodies descend to Gehinom for 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After 12 months their bodies are consumed, and their souls are burned and scattered beneath the feet of the righteous, as derived from a Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Heretics, Mosrim and Apikorsim, who have denied the Torah and the resurrection, separated from the community, spread fear, sinned and caused others to sin (such as Yeravam and co.) descend to Gehinom forever.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even when Gehinom is terminated, they are still not terminated.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They receive all this because they destroyed the Zevul (the Beis ha'Mikdash).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chanah said that Hash-m will smash such people.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Avin):</span> Their faces are as black as the bottom of a pot.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> These were elite of their town, and now they are the citizens of Gehinom.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ANALYZING THE <i>BERAISA</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can Beis Hillel say that intermediate people have the scales tipped in their favor when Beis Shamai cited a Pasuk that they descend to Gehinom for a period?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to Jews who sin with their bodies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that such people have no salvation!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only where they have a majority of sins; but where they are 50/50 and have sinned with their bodies, they descend to Gehinom for a period.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A Pasuk is inferred to refer to the Jewish People saying that Hash-m listens to their cries; when they don't have enough mitzvos, He tips the scales in their favor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are Jews who sin with their bodies?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> People who don't wear Tefillin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are non-Jews who sin with their bodies?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> People who are licentious.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are people that spread fear?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> Community leaders who instill fear amongst their community for evil motives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah, citing Rav):</span> Such people do not see their sons becoming Torah scholars.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beis Hillel said that Hash-m tilts the scales of intermediate people in their favor- how does this work?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Eliezer):</span> He pushes down the good side (as derived from a Pasuk).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> He lifts up the bad side (as derived from a Pasuk).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer (d'Bei R. Yishmael):</span> He places the first sins on the side, as is one of His attributes (as derived from a Pasuk).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> These first sins are not erased; if the person still has a majority of sins, they are added to them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>JUDGING AND BEING JUDGED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If somebody overlooks those who wrong him, the attribute of judgment overlooks his sins.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is derived from the Pasuk mentioning Hash-m's forgiving sins being followed by overlooking crimes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Huna ben R. Yehoshua was saved from a verdict of death because he overlooked those who wronged him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Acha bar Chanina):</span> The Pasuk later says something comforting, but not for all; Hash-m forgives, but only those who regard themselves as unworthy.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> It says that Hash-m is "righteous" (exacting) and then that He is "pious" (generous) - the latter is when He sees that the world cannot survive the former.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> It says that Hash-m is kind, and then that He is exacting - as above.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Ilfi/Ilfa):</span> Similar contradiction and resolution.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE THIRTEEN ATTRIBUTES OF MERCY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Hash-m clothed Himself like a Shali'ach Tzibur and told Moshe that whenever the Jews recite the thirteen attributes, they will be forgiven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Hash-m Hash-m" - displaying mercy both before man sins and after he has sinned and repented.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> "The Merciful G-d" - that there is a covenant that a recital of the thirteen attributes will always be answered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Great is Teshuvah, that it tears up a person's verdict, as derived from a Pasuk saying that he is healed.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Papa):</span> Perhaps that's only before the verdict?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abayey):</span> It is only a verdict that needs healing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that there is no infallible method of obtaining forgiveness:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one repents before Yom Kipur, one is forgiven; otherwise, all the Korbanos in the world won't help!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is only for a community that the recital of the 13 attributes works even after the verdict.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that there is no infallible method for tearing up the verdict:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the nation was originally wicked and the verdict was for less rain, later repentance cannot change the verdict, but the rain will fall in the best places.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the nation was originally righteous and the verdict was for more rain, later sins cannot change the verdict, but the rain will fall in the worst places.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We see that the verdict is never changed!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is only not changed because there is a simpler solution.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>CHANGING THE VERDICT FOR A COMMUNITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that even with a community, there is no way of changing a verdict:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Pesukim speak of sailors crying out in distress due to a storm and thanking Him for His help.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Pesukim are enclosed by brackets, teaching us that He doesn't help if the verdict has already been given!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are only a group, rated as individuals, rather than a community.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that the verdict cannot be changed:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Bluriya ha'Giyores):</span> One Pasuk says that Hash-m does not show favor, while another states that He does!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi ha'Kohen):</span> There is a parable:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A man swears by the life of a king to pay his loan on time.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He fails to do so, and asks the king for forgiveness.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>The king forgives, but warns him to seek forgiveness from the lender.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>Similarly, Hash-m can only show favor to those who sinned to Him, not to those who sinned to man.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer (R. Akiva):</span> Before the verdict He shows favor, afterwards He doesn't.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only referring to an individual.</p>
