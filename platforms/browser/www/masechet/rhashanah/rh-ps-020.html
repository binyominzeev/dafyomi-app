<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE LENGTH OF ADAR RISHON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Alternate version) (R. Nachman):</span> We have a supporting Mishnah that the Adar closest to Nisan is always abridged:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The witnesses of the moon for the months of Nisan and Tishrei can transgress Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>That makes sense if Adar closest to Nisan was always abridged, as it is a mitzvah to sanctify the month on the basis of eyewitness testimony.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But if the months were sometimes full and sometimes abridged, why should they be allowed to transgress Shabbos - let Beis Din make it full, and sanctify it on the following day!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Gemara explains why this is not a good proof:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>That would only hold true if the 30th fell on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But the Mishnah is referring to where the 31st fell on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>In this case, Beis Din have to sanctify the new month today, so the witnesses may transgress Shabbos (and the Mishnah therefore makes sense even if it is sometimes a full month).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Kahana):</span> We see from a Mishnah that it couldn't be that the Adar closest to Nisan is always abridged:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When the Beis ha'Mikdash was standing, the witnesses could transgress Shabbos for all months.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The reason was so that the Korban of Rosh Chodesh would be brought on the correct day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We see that we are not concerned about the months being sanctified on the basis of eyewitness testimony.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If the Adar closest to Nisan is sometimes abridged and sometimes full, it makes sense that the witnesses can transgress Shabbos, so that we know when Pesach should be.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>But if the Adar closest to Nisan is always abridged, why would the witnesses be allowed to transgress Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>This refutes the view that the Adar closest to Nisan is always abridged.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE BENEFITS OF A FULL ELUL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Ulla came to Bavel and told them that the Beis Din of Eretz Yisrael had made Elul a full month, which would be good for them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was it good for them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ulla):</span> The resultant separation of Shabbos and Yom Tov by a day would prevent picked vegetables from withering (new ones can be picked for Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate answer (R. Acha bar Chanina):</span> It would prevent bodies awaiting burial from decomposing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Where Yom Kipur followed Shabbos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There would still be a benefit in the case of bodies awaiting burial.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But there would be no benefit for vegetables; if needed after Yom Kipur, new ones can be picked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But even according to the opinion that the benefit is for vegetables, there would also be the benefit for bodies, so Elul would still be extended!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">New answer:</span> The difference is in the case of Yom Tov immediately preceding or following Shabbos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There would still be a benefit in separating Yom Tov for the vegetables.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But there is no benefit for bodies; they can be buried by non-Jews.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even according to the opinion that the benefit is for bodies, there would still be benefit for the vegetables?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They can be freshened by being soaked in hot water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Isn't the benefit as much for Eretz Yisrael as for Bavel?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Bavel is lower and therefore hotter.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>EXTENDING MONTHS FOR ULTERIOR MOTIVES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that is it not permitted to extend a month for an ulterior motive:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Shmuel):</span> One might think that just as years may be extended for an ulterior motive, months can also be extended;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Pasuk therefore teaches us that months must be set according to when the moon appears.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> One must distinguish between extending the month, and sanctifying it (before the correct time), reading it as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might think that just as years and months may be extended for an ulterior motive, months can also be sanctified (prematurely);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Pasuk therefore teaches us that months can only be sanctified according to when the moon appears.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This follows R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We intimidate witnesses into keeping silent so that the month can be extended.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>But we do not intimidate them into giving false testimony so that it can be abridged.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely R. Yehudah was taught by R. Yochanan that we intimidate people into testifying that they saw the moon so that the month can be abridged?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abayey):</span> That is only true for Nisan and Tishrei (when we want to set the date for the festivals).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate answer (Rava):</span> Rabah bar Shmuel's law (that one may not alter the calendar for ulterior motives) is the view of the Acheirim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Acheirim):</span> One festival differs from the previous occurrence of that festival in that it falls on the weekday four days later (i.e. the months always alternate between being abridged and full).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Dimi of Naharda'a):</span> The opposite of R. Yehoshua ben Levi's rule is true:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We intimidate people into giving false testimony so that the month can be abridged.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But we do not intimidate them into keeping silent so that it can be extended.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The reason is that the latter is noticeably fraudulent (as the new moon is seen by everyone), whereas the former isn't.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE VISIBILITY OF THE MOON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> "I am expert enough to set the calendar for all the Diaspora without witnesses."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Aba, father of R. Samla'i, to Shmuel):</span> "Do you know the difference between whether the Nolad is before or after midday?"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> "No."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Aba, father of R. Samla'i):</span> "Then there are bound to be other things that you don't know."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The first day of the month must be a night followed by a day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Nolad is before midday, the moon will be visible before sunset; if it is after, it won't.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the relevance of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> For catching out witnesses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira citing R. Nachman):</span> The moon is invisible for 24 hours between months:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In Bavel, 6 hours of the old moon and 18 hours of the new one;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In Eretz Yisrael, 6 hours of the new moon and 18 hours of the old one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the relevance of this?</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the first day of the month must be a night followed by a day?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The Pasuk says that Yom Kipur lasts "from evening to evening."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate answer (Resh Lakish):</span> The Pasuk states that Chametz may not be eaten until the 21st of Nisan in the evening.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abayey):</span> They are different Scriptural exegeses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate answer (Rava):</span> According to R. Yochanan, it begins with the onset of night; according to Resh Lakish, it begins at midnight.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>ADDITIONAL YOM TOV IN THE DIASPORA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira citing R. Nachman):</span> Doubts about when the month began result in an additional day of Yom Tov being observed a day later, not a day earlier.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We see that Yom Tov is kept on the 15th and 16th, not on the 14th.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should also be observed on the 14th, in case Av/ Shevat were abridged?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The months preceding them are always abridged, and if two consecutive months were to be abridged, people would find out about it in time.</p></div>
