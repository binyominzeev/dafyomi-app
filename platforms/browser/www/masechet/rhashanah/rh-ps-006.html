<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely the teaching from 've'Hayah Becha Chet' -that the sin is in the person, but the Korban is not disqualified"-can be inferred from the Beraisa of Ben Azai!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ben Azai):</span> "Lo S'acher" one might think that one who brings a Neder late has not achieved anything.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Oso" (Vayikra 7,18) therefore teaches us that it is only with regards to Pigul no endearment is achieved, but with regards to other Korbanos, although there is a sin of Bal Te'acher, the Korban is not disqualified!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "ve'Hayah Becha Chet" comes instead to exclude one's wife from accountability:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan/ R. Elazar):</span> A man's wife dies if he does not pay the money he promises.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One might think that she also dies if her husband is late in bringing his Korban; thus, the verse excludes her from accountability.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE BERAISA OF MOTZA SEFASECHA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Beraisa derives laws from the verse of "Motza Sefasecha Tishmor"(Devarim 23,24);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Motza Sefasecha" - teaches a positive mitzvah to keep to one's word;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Tishmor" - teaches a negative prohibition if this is transgressed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"v'Asisa" - instructs Beis Din to force a person to abide by his word;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"Ka'asher Nadarta" - refers to Nedarim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>"l'Hashem Elokecha" - includes Chata'os, Ashamos, Olos and Shelamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>"Nedavah" - refers to Nedavos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>"Asher Dibarta" - includes Kodshei Bedek haBayis;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>"b'Ficha" - includes promises of charity.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need "Motza Sefasecha" to teach a positive Mitzvah to keep to one's word - we have learned it from "u'Va'asa Shamah, veHeve'tem Shama"!(Devarim 11,5-6)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need "Tishmor" to teach a negative prohibition.-we have learned it from "Lo Se'acher"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need "v'Asisa" to instruct Beis Din to force a person to abide by his word - we have learned it from the Beraisa of "Yakriv Oso":</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Beraisa) "Yakriv Oso" (Vayikra 1,3) teaches us to force him to bring his Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Le'Retzono" teaches us that he must bring it willingly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The reconciliation of these two instructions is that we force him until he is willing to bring it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One set of exegeses is needed for a case where he proclaimed that he would bring a Korban, but did not set one aside, and another set is needed for a case where he set an animal aside but did not bring it</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They are both needed to be written;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Had we only been taught the case where he proclaimed that he would bring a Korban, but did not set one aside, we would think that he is accountable because he did not keep to his word; but if he set it aside, it belongs to Hash-m wherever it is, and we would think that he is not held accountable.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Had we only been taught the case where he set an animal aside, we would think that he is accountable because he is withholding a Korban; but if he only proclaimed that he would bring a Korban and did not set one aside, we would think that he has done nothing and is not held accountable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can one verse be referring to a case where he proclaimed that he would bring a Korban and did not set one aside - surely both sets of verses refer even to a Nedavah, which is an animal that has been set aside:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>(Mishnah) A Neder means one commits oneself to bring a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>A Nedavah means one designates a specific animal as a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>The difference is where the animal dies or was stolen; only in the case of a Neder is he liable to bring a replacement, whereas with a Nedavah there is no liability.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> One of the verses concerning Nedavah refers to a case where he proclaimed that he would bring a Korban without liability (and because of that aspect alone it is referred to as a Nedavah, even though no animal has been set aside).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>(Rava) "b'Fichah" mentioned in the Beraisa makes one obligated to fulfill his promises of charity, immediately because there are always poor people who await it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might think that since this teaching is written in the context of Korbanos, it has a three-festival period as with Korbanos; therefore we must be told that since the poor people await it, the obligation beings immediately.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE MITZVAS ASEH TO BRING KORBANOS ON TIME</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(Rava) After one festival has elapsed, one transgresses a positive mitzvah if one has not yet brought the Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Mishnah shows otherwise:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(R. Yehoshua and R. Papayas) The offspring of an animal that was pregnant when it was consecrated as a Shelamim is itself a Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(R. Papayas) A Shelamim was eaten on Pesach, and its calf was eaten on Chag ie Sukkos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The calf wasn't brought on Pesach as it was too young.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>How could they have avoided bringing it on Shavuos, if one transgresses a positive mitzvah by bringing it late?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zvid citing Rava):</span> It may have been sick on Shavuos.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Ashi):</span> The Chag being referred to is Shavuos, not Sukos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The one who asked the question held that when Shavuos is mentioned after Pesach, it is called Atzeres, not Chag.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE DAILY TRANSGRESSION OF BAL TE'ACHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(Rava) Once three festivals have passed, each day he transgresses Bal Te'acher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (from a Mishnah):</span> In the case of a Bechor or other Korbanos, one transgresses Bal Te'acher after a year (even before three festivals have passed) or after three festivals have passed (even in less than a year).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Response:</span> How does that present a question?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Kahana):</span> Since the Tana is discussing negative prohibitions, he should have stated that one has trangressed daily after these times have passed.!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Response:</span> The Tana's goal is only to establish when the prohibition begins, and not to list the additional prohibitions that are accrued daily.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>YEARS WITHOUT FESTIVALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The aforementioned Mishnah stated that Bal Te'acher is transgressed after three festivals even in less than a year.This is easily understood as Pesach through Sukos is just over six months</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But how can there be a year without three festivals?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>It would work according to Rebi, in the case of a leap year:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Beraisa) (Rebi) The year is calculated as 365 days even in a leap year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(Chachamim) The year is calculated to the same date of the same month; the extra month in a leap year gives him extra time to bring the Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>According to Rebi, therefore, if he consecrated it after Pesach, then after 365 days (due to Adar Sheni) three festivals will not have passed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But how are we to understand a year without three festivals according to the Chachamim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In accordance with the Mishnah of R. Shemayah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shavuos can fall on the fifth, sixth or seventh of Sivan:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If Nisan and Iyar are full (30 days), then it will be on the fifth.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If Nisan and Iyar are abridged (29 days), then it will be on the seventh.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>If one is full and one is abridged, it will fall on the sixth.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Thus, if Shavuos was on the fifth and he consecrated his Korban on the next day, and in the next year Nisan and Iyar are full,and Shavuos is on the seventh, then 365 days will have elapsed without three festivals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Acheirim argue with R. Shemayah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Every year has six full and six abridged months resulting in festivals always falling on the same date of the month but four days later in the week.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, in a leap year, the difference is five days later.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>BAL TE'ACHER FOR A YORESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Can a Yoresh (heir) be liable for Bal Te'acher?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do we consider that the Torah applies it only to "one who makes a Neder," (Devarim 23,22) and he didn't make it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or do we consider that the Torah's instruction that it be brought applies equally to him?(Devarim 12,5-6).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> "Me'imach" excludes a Yoresh (Devarim 23,22).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We established earlier that "Me'imach" refers to Leket, Shikcha and Peyah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Imach" refers to those things; the prefix "Me" excludes a Yoresh.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>BAL TE'ACHER FOR A WOMAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Is a woman liable for Bal Te'acher?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do we consider that since she has no mitzvah of seeing the Beis haMikdash, she is not liable?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or do we consider that since she has the mitzvah of Simchah on a festival (through eating the Korban), she is liable?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Since she has the mitzvah of Simchah on a festival, she is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Could Abaye have said such a thing? Surely he said that her mitzvah of Simchah is fulfilled through her husband buying her clothing?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Abaye was speaking according to R. Zeira's view that her mitzvah of Simchah is achieved through her eating a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>COUNTING A YEAR FOR A BECHOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> From which point does one count a year for a Bechor (after which one transgresses Bal Te'acher if it hasn't been brought as a Korban)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>(Abaye) From when it is born.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>(R. Acha bar Yakov) From when it is suitable for a Korban - the eighth day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This is not an argument - R. Acha is referring to a flawless animal, and Abaye is referring to a blemished animal (which can only be slaughtered outside the Beis haMikdash anyway, as soon as it is born).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely it is forbidden to eat a blemished animal (as it might be premature and classified as a stillborn-unless it survives for eight days)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to a case where it was established that it was not premature.</p></div>
