<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yehoshua, it is the second month in respect to Nisan, the first month; but according to R. Eliezer, why is it called the second month?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was second to the month in which the decree was set.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Eliezer, in which way did Hash-m change the order of the world in making Kima rise by day (when it always rises)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Following R. Chisda:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> They sinned with the heat of illicit relations;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>And they were punished with the heat of scalding waters (which was the change in the order of the world).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is learned from the identical word (Shaka) being used to describe the pacification of the waters, and the pacification of the heat of Achashverosh's anger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Jewish scholars count years (from creation) according to the opinion of R. Eliezer and the cycles of the sun and moon according to the opinion of R. Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The non-Jewish scholars also count years according to the opinion of R. Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE NEW YEAR FOR <i>YERAKOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Tosefta):</span> The first of Tishrei is the new year for Yerakos, Ma'asros, and Nedarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since Yerakos refers to Ma'aser Yerek, surely it is included in Ma'asros!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ma'aser Yerek, which is a d'Rabanan, is listed separately from other Ma'asros which are d'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why aren't the d'Oraisa items listed first?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The d'Rabanan law is more dear to the author and he therefore listed it first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the Tana of our Mishnah list Ma'asros?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He listed Yerakos which is d'Rabanan, and all the more so there must be a new year for Ma'asros which are d'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the Tosefta list Ma'aser in the singular?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes both Ma'aser Behemah and Ma'aser Dagan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the Tosefta list Yerek in the singular?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are two types of Yerek:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Vegetables that are sold in bunches are only liable for Ma'aser once they have been bunched.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Vegetables that are sold loose are liable for Ma'aser when a container is filled with them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE NEW YEAR FOR SEPARATING <i>MA'ASER</i></p><i>
</i><p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Tosefta):</span> If one harvested vegetables both before and after sundown on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, Terumah and Ma'aser may not be taken from one lot to exempt the other.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was the second year entering the third, that of the second requires Ma'aser Rishon and Sheni while that of the third requires Ma'aser Rishon and Ani.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that there is no Ma'aser Sheni in the third year?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> A Pasuk tells us that in the third year, only one of the previous two Ma'asros applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe Ma'aser Rishon shouldn't be given either?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk compares Ma'aser Rishon to inheritance to teach that there is no interruption to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Another Beraisa derives the law in the same way (as cited).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE NEW YEAR FOR <i>NEDARIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Tosefta):</span> If a person vows not to receive any benefit from another for a year, it is counted until the same calendar date a year later.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he vowed for this year, it finishes on Rosh Hashanah even if he said it on the last day in Elul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This would hold according to all, as his goal of making himself suffer was achieved.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Nisan should be the new year for Nedarim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The laws of Nedarim follow the normal use of words, with which Rosh Hashanah refers to Tishrei.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>CALCULATING YEARS FOR CROPS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The years for the Ma'aser of Tiltan spice are calculated according to when it sprouts seeds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The years for the Ma'aser of crops and olives are calculated from the year when they are one-third ripe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Asi citing R. Yochanan citing R. Yosi haGelili):</span> The Pasuk speaks of Shemitah laws applying in the Sukos of the following year - it must be referring to crops which grew their first third during Shemitah.</p>
