<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> TYPES OF SHOFAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> All types of horns may be used as a Shofar except those of a cow, because it is called Keren.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> All Shofros are called Keren, as we find in a Pasuk about the Keren of a Yovel (ram).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DISPUTE OVER COW'S HORNS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the response to R. Yosi's question?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All other horns are called both Keren and Shofar; those of a cow are called Keren but not Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi's response is that a Pasuk speaks of "Shor Par" which means Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Rabanan understand it to mean that the first Shor was the size of a Par.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Ulla):</span> The Rabanan's reason follows R. Chisda:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> The Kohen does not wear gold garments when he enters the Kodesh Kadshim as the accuser (gold, used for the Eigel) cannot become a defender (and likewise a cow's horn).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about the cow's blood?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It does not resemble the Eigel.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about the Ark, its cover and the Keruvim (which are made of gold)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The problem is only in <i>bringing</i> something that was used for sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about the gold spoon and pan brought with the Korban?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The problem is only in using such things for decorative purposes.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about the gold garments that are used in the outer part of the Sanctuary?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">viii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The problem is only in using such things in the Kodesh Kadshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ix.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Shofar is also only used in the outer part!?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">x.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it creates a remembrance, it is as though it is being used in the Kodesh Kadshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Mishnah, they gave the reason that it is called Keren!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is an additional reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yosi's response is that the Shofar is only used in the outer part, and all Shofros are called Keren.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Rabanan's reason is that the Torah instructs that a single Shofar be used, and a cow's horn looks like an amalgam of several Shofros.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Mishnah, they gave the reason that it is called Keren!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is an additional reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi's response is that it is all combined into a single Shofar, and all Shofros are called Keren.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TERMINOLOGY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Yovel refers to a ram?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva heard that word used in Arabia.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In France, he heard a Nidah referred to as a Galmuda, meaning someone who has become separate (Gamul) from her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In Africa, he heard a Ma'ah (value) referred to as a Keshita, which explains the term as used in the Chumash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(Rebbi) In the islands, I heard a Mechirah (sale) called a Kirah, which explains the term as used in the Chumash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> I heard a bride called a Ninfi (as in Yefeh Nof) and a rooster called a Sechvi (as a Pasuk refers to it having understanding).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Levi had someone say that somebody had "Ba'an" him, but he didn't know what it meant.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He was told in the Beis ha'Midrash that it meant "robbed."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava said that he would have asked how and why it happened, and would have deduced its meaning from the answers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Levi didn't do that as he thought that it referred to Issur rather than a monetary matter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Rabanan didn't know what Serugin meant, until they heard a woman refer to a crowd of people moving in small groups by that term.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Rabanan didn't know what Chalaglugos meant, until they heard this woman refer to purslane-plant by that term.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Rabanan didn't know what Salsela meant, until they heard her refer to someone curling his hair with this term.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Rabanan didn't know what Ta'atasei meant, until they heard her instruct someone to sweep with a broom with this term.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Rabanan didn't know what "Cast Yehavcha on Hash-m and He will sustain you" meant, until they heard a merchant refer to his burden with that term.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> DIFFERENT TYPES OF SHOFAR FOR DIFFERENT DAYS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Shofar of Rosh Hashanah is made from the straight horn of an ibex (wild goat) and its mouthpiece is overlaid with gold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is flanked by two trumpets, which are blown for a shorter time, because the mitzvah of the day is the Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Shofar of a Ta'anis is made from the curved horn of a ram and its mouthpiece is covered with silver.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Two trumpets are placed in the center, and are blown for a longer time, because they are the mitzvah of the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rosh Hashanah and Yovel are identical regarding the Shofar notes and the Berachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> On Rosh Hashanah, they would blow ram's horns, and on Yovel, ibex horns.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>DISPUTES OVER THE TYPE OF SHOFAR THAT IS USED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> On Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipur, the mitzvah is to use the curved Shofar (of a ram); on a Ta'anis, the mitzvah is to use the straight horn (of an ibex).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In our Mishnah, it says that the Shofar of Rosh Hashanah is the straight horn of an ibex?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Levi follows the opinion of a different Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> On Rosh Hashanah, they would blow ram's horns, and on Yovel, ibex horns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Levi simply say that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As we would then think that the Halachah follows him even for using an ibex Shofar for Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the basis of the dispute?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah holds that on Rosh Hashanah, it is better to bend (humble) oneself before Hash-m; on Yom Kipur, it is better to practice straightness (simple honesty); the Tana Kama holds the reverse.</p>
