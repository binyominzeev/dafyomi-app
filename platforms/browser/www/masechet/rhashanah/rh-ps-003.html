<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SOURCE OF NISAN AS THE NEW YEAR FOR KINGS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question on R. Yochanan's source:</span> Maybe the years from the Exodus are counted from Iyar?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse considers the completion of the (Shemos 40,17) Mishkan in Nisan and the subsequent lifting of the cloud in Iyar (Bamidbar 10,11) to both be in the same (2nd) year. This shows that Iyar can't be the start of the new year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe the years from the Exodus are counted from Sivan?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the encampment at Sinai in Sivan would be dated as "the second year" in addition to "the third month". (Shemos 19,1)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe the years from the Exodus are counted from Tamuz, Av or Adar?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Source #2 (R. Elazar):</span> The new year for kings is learned from a verse (Divrei ha'Yamim II 3,2) stating that Shlomo began building the Beis ha'Mikdash in Iyar, "in the second," which surely means that Iyar is second to the month from which the king's years are counted - namely, Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Maybe it means the second day of the month (Iyar)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It would have said so explicitly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe it means the second day of the week?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Firstly, the Torah does not speak in such terms. In addition, "in the second" is adjacent to "the second month". Therefore, it must also be referring to a month.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>There is a Beraisa which supports R. Yochanan's source.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>NON-JEWISH KINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">R. Chisda:</span> Non-Jewish kings count years of reign from Tishrei</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Source:</span> One verse (Nechemyah 1,1) refers to Kislev of the 20th year and another verse (Nechemyah 2,1) refers to the subsequent Nisan as being in the 20th year of Artachshasta's reign.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the first verse is counting the years of Artachshasta's reign?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> The identical phrase of "the twentieth year" in each verse creates a Gezeirah Shavah which proves that they are both counting the years of Artachshasta's reign.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the Kislev event preceded the Nisan event ? Maybe the Nisan event took place previously?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Beraisa states that Chanani's message to Nechemyah in Kislev (Nechemyah 1,2-3) was repeated to the King in Nisan (Nechemyah 2,1-6).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosef):</span> A verse (Chagai 1,1) concerning the reign of Daryavesh refers to the month Elul of his second year, and another verse (Chagai 2,1) refers to the subsequent month of Tishrei without calling it "the third year"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> Koresh was so called because he was a kosher king (switch "r" and"sh"); therefore his years are dated from Nisan, like a Jewish king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (R. Yosef):</span> We find a verse (Ezra 6,15) that refers to Adar of the sixth year of the reign of Daryavesh, and another verse (Ezra 7,8) refers to the month of Av fifteen months later as being in the seventh year. If Nisan began the years of Daryavesh, it should have been dated as the eighth year!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (R. Yosef):</span> We are discussing Daryavesh, not Koresh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer to question #2:</span> Koresh, Daryavesh and Artachshasta are all the same person. He was named Koresh because he was a kosher king, Artachshasta was the name of his kingdom, and Daryavesh was his name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer to question #1:</span> His years were counted from Tishrei after he turned evil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Kahana):</span> Did Daryavesh really turn evil? Surely we find that he gave many gifts to the Kohanim! (Ezra 6,9)</p>
