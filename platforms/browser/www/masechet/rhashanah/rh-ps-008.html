<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE DISPUTE ABOUT THE ROSH HASHANAH FOR MA'ASER BEHEMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(Our Mishnah) The year for Ma'aser Behemah begins on the first of Elul (R. Meir) or on the first of Tishrei (R. Elazar & R. Shimon).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Explanation #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> Both opinions are derived from a single verse:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"The meadows are clothed with sheep, and the valleys are covered with corn, they shout with joy, they also sing" (Tehillim 65,14).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(R. Meir) The meadows are clothed with sheep (i.e. they conceive) at the time when the valleys are covered with corn, which is Adar. The sheep then give birth in Av, so the Rosh Hashanah is the first of Elul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(R. Elazar & R. Shimon) The meadows are clothed with sheep (i.e. they conceive) at the time when the crops shout with joy and also sing (i.e. the ripe grains rustle in the stalks), which is Nisan. The sheep then give birth in Elul, so the Rosh Hashanah is the first of Tishrei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Gemara discusses difficulties with these opinions:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Meir do with the phrase "they shout with joy, they also sing"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to the minority of sheep that conceive late, in Nisan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do R. Elazar & R. Shimon do with the phrase "the valleys are covered with corn"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to the minority of sheep that conceive early, in Adar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir's explanation works well, as the verse lists the majority of sheep first; but according to R. Elazar & R. Shimon, the verse should have said "they shout with joy, they also sing" (which refers to the majority of sheep) before "the valleys are covered with corn"!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Explanation #2 (Rava):</span> All agree that the sheep conceive in Adar; the dispute derives from a different verse:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Aser T'aser"(Devarim 14,22) refers to both Ma'aser Behemah and Ma'aser Dagan (comparing the two by way of a Hekesh):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(R. Meir) Just as Ma'aser is taken from Dagan close to the end of the process (in Tisheri, when the grain is gathered), so too Ma'aser is taken from Behemos close to the end of the process (when the sheep give birth, in Elul).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(R. Elazar and R. Shimon) Just as Ma'aser Dagan has its Rosh Hashanah in Tishrei, so too Ma'aser Behemah has its Rosh Hashanah in Tishrei.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE ROSH HASHANAH FOR YEARS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> For which Halachos do we need to be told that the new year for counting years is on the first of Tishrei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Papa):</span> In order to discern that a contract is pre-dated (and thus invalid).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely we learned that the first of Nisan was the Rosh Hashanah for kings for the same Halachah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For Jewish kings, the first of Nisan is the Rosh Hashanah; for non-Jewish kings, the first of Tishrei is the Rosh Hashanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chisda (3a) stated that the first of Nisan was only the Rosh Hashanah for Jewish kings, but the year for non-Jewish kings begins in Tishrei; was he coming to tell us that which had already been stated in a Mishnah itself?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chisda was coming to teach us how it is derived from the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate answer:</span> R. Chisda understands that the purpose of Tishrei being the Rosh Hashanah for years is as stated by R. Zeira:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>(R. Zeira) The first of Tishrei is the new year for calculating the cycles of the sun and moon.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This follows R. Elazar's view that the world was created in Tishrei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The purpose of the Rosh Hashanah for years is to begin the process of judgment - at the beginning of the year, the fate of the end of the year is determined.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that this occurs in Tishrei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah states "Blow the Shofar at the new month, at the appointed time (Bakeseh) on our festival day" - the festival on which the moon is Keseh, covered (i.e. small and invisible from afar) is Rosh Hashanah. The next Pasuk states that this is the time of judgment.(Tehilim 81,4-5)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE JUDGMENT OF THE WORLD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(Beraisa) The Pasuk states that "It is a law for Yisrael" and then it states that "It is a judgment for the God of Yakov" - this teaches that the Heavenly Court sits in judgment only after Beis Din have sanctified the new month.(Tehilim 81,5)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Another Beraisa):</span> "It is a law for Yisrael" only teaches that there is judgment for Jews; "It is a judgment for the God of Yakov" teaches that there is also judgment for all nations.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why, then, does it need to say "It is a law for Yisrael" (seeing as Jews would anyway be included in the second phrase)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach that the Jews enter judgment first, in accordance with R. Chisda's teaching;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>(R. Chisda) A king is judged before the community.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this so?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It isn't respectful for him to have wait in line.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He should be judged before the judge grows too angry.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE ROSH HASHANAH FOR SHEMITAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the new year for Shemitah is on the first of Tishrei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shemitah is called "the seventh year" (Vayikra 25,4) and we learn (by way of Gezerah Shavah) from the occurrence of the word "year" in the Pasuk "from the beginning of the year" (Devarim 11,12) in reference to Tishrei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not learn from the occurrence of the word "year" in the Pasuk "It is the first for you for the months of the year" in reference to Nisan? (Shemos 12,2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We should learn the occurrence of the word "year" without any mention of months from the same type of "year", rather than learn it from the occurrence of the word "year"which is mentioned along with months.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE ROSH HASHANAH FOR YOVEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely the new year for Yovel is on the tenth of Tishrei, not the first?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>It follows the view of R. Yishmael ben R. Yochanan ben Beroka in the following Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Torah state that "the fiftieth year should be consecrated" (Vayikra 25,10) (seeing as we have already been told that Yovel follows the forty-ninth year)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach that the whole year is sanctified, from the first of Tishrei, and not from Yom Kipur, when the Shofar is blown.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(R. Yishmael ben R. Yochanan ben Beroka) Therefore, although servants weren't released during the first ten days of Tishrei, they also weren't actively enslaved to their masters; instead they would eat, drink and be merry.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>When Yom Kipur arrived, the servants would be released to their homes, and the fields would return to their original owners.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The opposing Rabanan use the word "year" (of the previously mentioned verse) to teach that only years (of Yovel) are consecrated with a proclamation, and not new months.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What do the words "It is Yovel" teach us?(Vayikra 25,11)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>From the words "the fiftieth year should be consecrated" one might think that just as the beginning of Yovel starts from the first of Tishrei (even before the tenth of Tishrei), so too it should extend to the tenth of Tishrei of the fifty-first year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The extension beyond the duration of a year is not unusual, as we attach non-holy to holy time-periods in order to lengthen them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Therefore the Torah states that "It is Yovel"-it, and not the fifty-first year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Rabanan (who did not learn that Yovel begins from the first of Tishrei, and therefore do not need "It is Yovel" to teach that it shouldn't be extended into the next year), use "It is Yovel" to teach that the fiftieth year is counted as Yovel alone, and not as both Yovel and as the first year of the next cycle.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This goes against the opinion of R. Yehudah, who holds that it is also counted as the first year of the next fifty-year cycle.</p></div>
