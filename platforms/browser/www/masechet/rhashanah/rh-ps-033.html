<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CUTTING THE SHOFAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah prohibited cutting it with something forbidden d'Rabanan - such as a sickle - or d'Oraisa - such as a knife.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Mishnah need to prohibit the d'Oraisa when it has already prohibited the d'Rabanan?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The format is that "this, and needless to say this" is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>RINSING THE SHOFAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that it can be rinsed with wine or water, excluding urine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This follows the view of Aba Shaul who forbade this even on a weekday out of respect for the Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CHILDREN BLOWING SHOFAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that we do not prevent children from blowing the Shofar - implying that we do prevent women from doing so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa states that we do not prevent either women or children from blowing Shofar on Rosh Hashanah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah follows R. Yehudah, whereas the Beraisa follows R. Yosi and R. Shimon:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) (R. Yehudah):</span> Only men may lean on their Korbanos, but not women.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi and R. Shimon):</span> Women can lean if they want to.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Mishnah stated that we encourage children to learn how to blow Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even on Shabbos, they can do this, as confirmed in a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We encourage the children to learn to blow Shofar, even on Shabbos. We do not prevent them from blowing Shofar on Shabbos, and obviously not on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first part says it is to be encouraged, but the latter part says it is simply not to be prevented (but not encouraged)!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first part deals with a child who has reached Chinuch, and so we have to instruct him in the mitzvah.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ABSENT-MINDED BLOWING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah stated that one who blows absent-mindedly is not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that if he blew it for music, he is Yotzei - does this support Rava's statement to that effect?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana might also be referring to such a person as absent-mindedly blowing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Mishnah said that one who hears from someone blowing absentmindedly is not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that one who hears from someone blowing only for himself is Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This contradicts R. Zeira, who instructed his attendant to have him in mind when blowing!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the term "absent-mindedly" is being used only to match the previous ruling (but this case would have the same law).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> THE SHOFAR BLASTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The order of the Shofar blasts is three sets of three (Teki'ah, Teru'ah, Teki'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A Teki'ah is the length of three Teru'os and a Teru'ah is the length of three whimpers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he blew the last Teki'ah of a set as the length of two, it only counts as one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one said Musaf and only then gained access to a Shofar, he should blow Teki'ah-Teru'ah-Teki'ah three times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Just as the Shali'ach Tzibur must say the prayer, so too must every individual.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Gamliel):</span> The Shali'ach Tzibur is Yotzei for them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>THE LENGTH OF THE <i>TEKI'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah stated that a Teki'ah is the length of three Teru'os, but a Beraisa says that it is the same length?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah is counting the total number of Teki'os and Teru'os, whereas the Beraisa counts only those of one set.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah stated that a Teru'ah is the length of three whimpers, but a Beraisa says that a Teru'ah is the length of three Shevarim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a disagreement, based on the meaning of the word Yevava, the Aramaic translation of Teru'ah, which is used to describe the crying of Sisera's mother; the Mishnah holds that it means whimpers, the Beraisa holds that it means moanings.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">7)</span>THE FORM AND MAKE-UP OF THE BLASTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the Teru'ah of Rosh Hashanah must be sounded with a Shofar?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk says "ve'Haavarta Shofar Teru'ah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is referring to Yom Kipur of Yovel - how do we know that it is also true for Rosh Hashanah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah has a superfluous mention of "the seventh month" to tell us that all the Teru'os of the seventh month should be the same, sounded with a Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that a Teki'ah should precede the Teru'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The word "ve'Haavarta," preceding "Teru'ah," refers to the straight blast of the Teki'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that a Teki'ah should follow the Teru'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The word "Teru'ah" is followed by the word "Taaviru" referring to a Teki'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is referring to Yom Kipur of Yovel - how do we know that it is also true for Rosh Hashanah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah has a superfluous mention of "the seventh month" to tell us that all the Teru'os of the seventh month should be the same, sounded with a Shofar.</p>
