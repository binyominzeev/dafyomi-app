<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CALCULATING YEARS FOR CROPS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Perhaps the Pasuk is telling us that all Shemitah prohibitions continue until Sukos of the next year?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We know that the Pasuk is referring to produce that has grown one-third:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah calls Sukos "the festival of Asif."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Asif can't mean ingathering, as Sukos has already been called the time of ingathering.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It must therefore refer to harvesting of crops.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Rabanan established that crops harvested on Sukos must have grown one-third in the previous year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Can the Rabanan so precisely ascertain that it must have grown exactly one-third?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Don't question the Rabanan; all halachic measures are this way:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Precisely forty Se'ah are required for Tevilah; a Kurtav less won't work.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Precisely the volume of an egg is required to make food Tamei; a sesame seed less won't.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Precisely 3 x 3 Tefachim in area of cloth is required to become Tamei by Medras; a hairsbreadth less won't.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>R. YIRMEYAH'S PROOF FOR ONE-THIRD GROWTH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> There is indeed proof that the Rabanan could determine when the produce was one-third grown:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did the Bnei Yisrael use for their first Korban Omer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Crops that had grown under non-Jewish ownership.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah states that it must be from "Your" harvest!?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they didn't bring the Omer in the first year?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It states that they ate only after Pesach; this must have been triggered by the Omer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Kahana):</span> They used produce that had grown less than a third in the possession of a non-Jew.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it had grown more than that, and they were unable to ascertain it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be that they were able to adequately ascertain it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Here, too, the Rabanan can discern which produce is one-third ripe by Rosh Hashanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it hadn't grown at all under non-Jews, but in a case where it did, we can't tell how much?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They had only been in the country for five days, so some growth must have taken place beforehand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yirmeyah's proof is now lost:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if it had only grown one-sixth or one-fifth, how could five days be enough to finish its growth?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must have finished with the special gazelle-like swiftness of Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If so, it could have also undergone all its growth in that time!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE PROOF THAT ONE-THIRD GROWTH COUNTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanina):</span> "Asif" is simply the name of Sukos (and cannot be inferred to mean harvesting)!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> We had a proof that years for produce follow the first third of its growth, and R. Chanina has destroyed it - from where shall we learn it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yonasan ben Yosef):</span> A Pasuk is read to refer to a third of the crop's growth.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This Pasuk is needed to teach that the pre-Shemitah year will give three years' worth of crops!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is another Pasuk to teach us that.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>KITNIYOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kitniyos which rooted before Rosh Hashanah follow the previous year for Ma'aser, and are permitted if it is Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they took root after Rosh Hashanah then they are forbidden if it is Shemitah, and they follow the current year for Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> The Rabanan determined the calculations for every food:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>With trees, we follow the sprouting of their fruit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>With crops and olives, we follow the year when they grew one-third;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>With vegetables, we follow their harvesting;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>What is the system for Kitniyos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Since they are harvested very gradually, it was decided to follow when they take root, as otherwise the years cannot be kept distinct.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abayey):</span> Let him mix together his entire stock, and we will consider that Ma'aser is being correctly taken from each year's produce, as in a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi ben Kipur citing R. Shimon Shezuri):</span> Ma'aser may not be taken from Egyptian beans (Kitniyos) which took root in one year onto that which took root in another.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The solution is to mix everything together and we assume that the Ma'aser is from each year in the correct proportion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> That only works according to R. Shimon Shezuri who holds of Bilah (that we can assume there is proportional representation).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Nachmani citing Shmuel):</span> The halachah follows R. Yosi ben Kipur citing R. Shimon Shezuri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Surely Shmuel held that there is only Bilah with wine and oil?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel also held that we follow the end of the growth, not the taking root (and the mixing works because it is all from the same year for Ma'aser, not because of Bilah).</p>
