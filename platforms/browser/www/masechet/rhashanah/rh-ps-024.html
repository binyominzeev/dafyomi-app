<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE POSITION OF THE MOON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If the witness said that the moon was north of the sun, his testimony stands; if he says it was south of it, his testimony is worthless.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely it states the opposite in a Beraisa (as cited)!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is referring to summer (when the moon is south of the sun) and the other refers to winter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one of the witnesses gives the height of the new moon as two saddle-cloths, and the other one as three, their testimony is accepted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if one were to say three saddle-cloths, and the other five, it is disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, either can combine with other witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If they saw the moon's reflection, or they saw it through a crystal, or through clouds, they cannot testify about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they saw half of it in this way, they cannot testify about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they cannot testify when they saw the whole moon this way, isn't it obvious that they cannot testify when they only saw half of it this way?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that they saw the other half of it in the sky directly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If they say that they saw it but later they didn't see it, their testimony does not work.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely they don't need to constantly keep it in view?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that they casually observed it but did not see it when they tried to inspect it for the purpose of testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Their testimony is unacceptable because it might have been a cloud that they saw.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> THE SANCTIFICATION OF <i>ROSH CHODESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Rosh Beis Din pronounces "Mekudash!" and everyone repeats it twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Whether the moon was seen on the 30th or 31st, this is done.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar ben R. Tzadok):</span> If it was seen on the 31st, it is not done, as it has already been sanctified by Heaven.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SOURCE OF THE LAWS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the Rosh Beis Din does it first?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because the Pasuk states that Moshe told over the Mo'adim to the Bnei Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the people repeat it after him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because the Pasuk that "they shall declare them" can be read as "<i>you</i> shall declare them."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer (R. Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The source is a Pasuk which refers to "them" declaring the Mo'adim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do they repeat it twice?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As the Pasuk speaks of "Mikra'i Kodesh" in the plural.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>IN WHICH CASES IT IS SANCTIFIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar ben R. Tzadok):</span> If it was seen on the 31st, it is not sanctified, as it has already been sanctified by Heaven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Plimo):</span> It is only sanctified if seen on the 31st, not if seen on the 30th.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar ben R. Shimon):</span> In either case, it is not sanctified.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The source is that the Pasuk about consecrating the fiftieth year teaches us that only years are consecrated with a proclamation, and not new months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The halachah follows R. Elazar ben R. Tzadok.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye):</span> This is also evident from a later Mishnah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Beis Din didn't manage to sanctify it before dark, it is a full month.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But it doesn't say that they sanctify it on the next day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Refutation:</span> The Mishnah is not excluding this; the purpose of it is to stress that even though everyone saw the moon on the 30th, it is a full month if it wasn't sanctified before dark.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> RABAN GAMLIEL'S PICTURES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Raban Gamliel had pictures of the moon to show people and ask which they saw.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>THE PERMISSIBILITY OF PICTURES OF THE MOON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely the Pasuk forbids making images of Hash-m's servants?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It only forbids making images of those servants which it is possible to make a replica of (but not of heavenly bodies):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not make a replica of the Mikdash or anything in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may make a Menorah as long as it doesn't have seven branches.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A seven-branched Menorah may not be made even from metals other than gold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Yehudah):</span> It may not even be made from wood, as the Chashmona'im made a menorah from wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Their menorah was made from iron and overlaid with tin (and later upgraded to silver and then to gold).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely it is not permitted to make images of the Heavenly bodies:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We learn from a Pasuk that one may not make an image of anything that serves Hash-m in the Heavens.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Only the combined image of four creatures that is on Hash-m's throne is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that an image of man alone is permitted, yet we see in a Beraisa that it is forbidden!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk also prohibits the image of Hash-m (which is that of a man in the visions of prophets).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see in a Beraisa that images of other servants, such as Ofanim etc., are also forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is only the servants in the upper Heavens that one may not make images of.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see in a Beraisa that the Pasuk also prohibits making images of the sun, moon and other bodies in the lower Heavens?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is referring to making images for the sake of worship.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For such purposes, even making the image of a worm is forbidden!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> True, and the continuation of the Pasuk includes that.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see in a Beraisa that the Pasuk prohibits making images of the sun and moon even not for the sake of worship!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Raban Gamliel had non-Jews make the images for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When R. Yehudah had non-Jews make such images on a signet-ring for him, Shmuel rebuked him!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The images protruded from the ring, which risks suspicion of being an idol:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A ring whose image protrudes may not be worn, but may be used for a seal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the image is sunken, it may be worn but not used for a seal.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely there is no risk of suspicion, as we see that Rav, Shmuel and others would Daven in a Shul that had a statue in it!?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>There is no such suspicion in a public place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely Raban Gamliel was an individual and there should be the risk of suspicion (even for a flat image, since that is how the moon appears anyway)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he was a prince, he would be visited by many people (and there is no suspicion in a public place).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer:</span> They were not whole pictures, but rather were composites of partial pictures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer:</span> They were made for learning purposes, and the Pasuk only forbids making them for practical purposes.</p>
