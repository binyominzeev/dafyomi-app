<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav Anan (was unsure because he) had not heard the Beraisa;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>From Shmuel's opinion that it is not sold. he could not deduce that he gets his money back. Perhaps it is not sold and the money is a gift, like Shmuel said elsewhere!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a man was Mekadesh his sister, she must return the money. (Everyone knows that he cannot be Mekadesh her. He intended that she watch it for him, like a deposit);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He intended to give her a gift. (Therefore, she keeps the money.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Why do we fine the buyer? (He loses his money.) Rather, we should fine the seller!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> A mouse could not steal (food) if it did not have a hole to hide it in. (Similarly, the seller could not transgress if he did not find a buyer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The hole (buyer) does not steal unless there is a mouse (seller)!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A year of mildew stricken crops... (but if he was Narah or Hovirah, this counts towards the two years).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Hovirah counts towards the two years (even though he did nothing), there is no need to say Narah (he plowed it)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Narah teaches a Chidush:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that the buyer need not return the field unless the seller pays him for harving plowed it. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer) Question:</span> What is the source that if one sold a field before Rosh Hashanah laden with produce, he cannot demand that the buyer return it laden?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "B'Mispar Shenei Tevu'os Yimkar Lach" (all the produce of the years is sold) teaches that sometimes one consumes three harvests in two years.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH PRICE IS USED FOR REDEMPTION?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sold his field to Shimon for 100 (Zuz), and Shimon sold it to Levi for 200, (if Reuven wants to redeem it) he calculates according to the price of the first sale (which is lower), for it says "la'Ish Asher Machar Lo."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If Reuven sold to Shimon for 200, and Shimon to Levi for 100, Reuven redeems according to the second sale. "V'Chishav Es Shenei Mimkaro... la'Ish Asher Machar Lo" refers to the current owner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One may not sell a field far away to redeem one nearby, nor sell a bad to redeem a good one, nor borrow money to redeem, nor redeem half the field;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>One may redeem a Hekdesh field in any of these ways. This is a stringency of people over Hekdesh. (It is easier to redeem from Hekdesh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - Rebbi) Question:</span> If Reuven sold to Shimon for 100, and Shimon sold to Levi for 200, what is the source that Reuven redeems according to the first sale?</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Dostai ben Yehudah):</span> If Reuven sold to Shimon for 100, and the field (by itself) rose in value to 200, what is the source that Reuven redeems according to the sale price?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Heshiv Es ha'Odef'" teaches that he gives only Odef in his hand (money left from the sale, but never more than it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Dostai):</span> If Reuven sold to Shimon for 200, and the field declined in value to 100, what is the source that Reuven redeems according to the current value?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Heshiv Es ha'Odef" teaches that he gives only Odef of the land (what it is still worth).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do the Tana'im argue about? (Rosh - surely, Rebbi agrees with R. Dostai's law. We learn from Eved Ivri)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about a case in which the land was expensive, became cheap, and rose in value again.	(Rashi - Shimon bought from Reuven for 200, sold it to Levi for 100, and its value returned to 200. Rebbi holds that Reuven redeems for the lower sale price. R. Dostai holds that he redeems for the current value. R. Gershom - Reuven sold for 200, the value declined to 100 and returned to 200. R. Dostai holds that he redeems for 100, which is the lowest value of the field since it was sold. Rebbi discussed only the case of two buyers.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to both Tana'im,) what is the source to be lenient (redeem for the lower amount)? Perhaps we must be stringent!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Ge'ulah-Ge'ulah" from Eved Ivri. (Shitah Mekubetzes - if not for the above verses, we would not know to learn this from the Gezeirah Shavah; Tzon Kodashim - this is not really a Gezeirah Shavah. It is just a Giluy Milsa, i.e. reveals that the same applies in both cases.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verses (for Eved Ivri) could be expounded leniently or stringently. How do we know to expound leniently?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We find that the Torah is lenient for an Eved Ivri;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ki Tov Lo Imach" teaches that he partakes of your (good) food and drink (and other comforts);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The master cannot eat clean bread, drink old wine and sleep on a soft mattress, and the Eved eats bread from inferior flour, new wine and sleeps on the ground. (Rather, one must treat his slave as well as himself);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Buying an Eved Ivri is like acquiring a master.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should be stringent, because the Eved sinned!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> How severe is the punishment for the dust (i.e. a light prohibition, selling produce) of Shemitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one sells Shemitah produce, he will later have to sell his Metaltelim. It says "bi'Shenas ha'Yovel ha'Zos Tashuvu...", and then "v'Chi Simkero... Oh Kano mi'Yad Amisecha," which refers to Metaltelim, which are acquired from hand to hand. (Tosfos - presumably, the punishment is Midah k'Neged Midah, for a transgression of selling.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he does not sense (that Hash-m is punishing him for his sin), he will have to sell his fields - "Ki Yamuch Achicha u'Machar me'Achuzaso";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If it does not occur to him (why he is faltering), he will have to sell his house - "v'Ish Ki Yimkor Beis Moshav Ir Chomah"</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Before, it said "if he does not sense." Why does it say now "if it does not occur to him"?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Rav Huna's teaching.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Once one sins and repeats the sin, it becomes permitted to him.</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna means that he <i>considers</i> it to be permitted. (The first time, he was aware that he was sinning.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>He will ultimately sell his daughter - "v'Chi Yimkor Ish Es Bito l'Amah." (This is the order according to R. Akiva Eiger.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>If it does not occur to him, he will need to borrow (from a Nochri) on interest - "v'Chi Yamuch Achicha... Al Tikach me'Ito Neshech v'Sarbis."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Torah does not discuss selling a daughter in this Parshah. Nevertheless, that Tana teaches that it is better to sell a daughter before borrowing on interest;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This is because the cost of redeeming a daughter decreases over time, wheaeas a loan on interest increases.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>If it does not occur to him, he will have to sell himself - "v'Chi Yamuch Achicha v'Nimkar Lach";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>If he does not merit, he will sell himself, but not "Lach (to you, a Yisrael)," rather, "l'Ger", and not to a convert, rather, "l'Ger Toshav" (a Nochri who accepted to guard his seven Mitzvos). "Mishpachas Ger" teaches that he will sell himself to a Nochri. "Oh l'Eker" teaches that he will sell himself to idolatry itself (to chop wood and draw water, or to sweep in front of it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> In spite of his sins, we find that the Torah is merciful upon him:</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, this teaches that if his value increased, his redemption is calculated "mi'Kesef Miknaso." If his value decreased, he is redeemed "k'Fi Shanav" (according to his current value).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Tosfos - Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if he worked two years, the redemption for the four remaining years is based on Kesef Miknaso (since we are closer to the time of his sale than to the end of his term), but if he worked four years, he is redeemed k'Fi Shanav (based on his current value)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rashi - Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the verses (do not discuss one whose value changed.
