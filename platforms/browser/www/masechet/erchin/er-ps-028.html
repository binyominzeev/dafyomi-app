<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ONE MAY NOT BE MACHARIM EVERYTHING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> One may be Macharim some of his cattle and flock, some of his male and female (Kena'ani) slaves, some of his Sedeh Achuzah. (There are two kinds of Cherem. One is Hekdesh Bedek ha'Bayis. Our Mishnah discusses the other. It is initially Hekdesh, and becomes Chulin when it is given to Kohanim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he was Macharim all of them, it does not take effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Elazar ben Azaryah says, if one may not be Macharim all of his property, all the more so he should (Shitah Mekubetzes - must) be concerned for his property (and not give too much Tzedakah to others)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> "(One may be Macharim) <i>mi</i>'Kol Asher Lo" - "<i>from</i> all", but not all his property; "me'Adam", but not all his slaves; "u'Vehemah", but not all his animals; "umi'Sedeh Achuzaso", but not all his fields.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he should not be Macharim all of them, but if he did, it takes effect!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ach" (excludes).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Elazar ben Azaryah says, if one may not be Macharim all of his property to Hekdesh, all the more so he must be concerned for his property!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Torah needed to write all of these;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it excluded only all his property, one might have thought that he may be Macharim all of one type. Therefore, it says "me'Adam";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it excluded only all his slaves, one might have thought this is because one needs people to work for him, but he does not need fields. (He can be a sharecropper for others);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Had it excluded only slaves and land, one might have thought this is because his livelihood depends on them, but he does not need Metaltelim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Therefore, it needed to write all of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "Behemah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one can be Macharim his son, daughter, male or female (Yisrael) slaves, and Sedeh Miknah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "U'Vehemah" teaches that one can be Macharim only things like animals, i.e. property that he can sell.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A man can sell his (minor) daughter (to be a slave)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He can be Macharim only what he can sell permanently, like an animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> One may not be Macharim all of his property to Hekdesh...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also the first Tana said this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about Rav Ila's law:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ila):</span> (When the Sanhedrin was) in Usha, they enacted that one should not give more than a fifth of his money (to Tzedakah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A case occurred in which a man wanted to give more than a fifth. His friends did not allow him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> R. Yeshevav (was the friend who) did not allow him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> R. Yeshevav wanted to give more than a fifth, and R. Akiva did not allow him.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THINGS ONE MAY NOT BE MACHARIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man was Macharim his son, daughter, male or female (Yisrael) slaves, or Sedeh Miknah, it does not take effect, for one cannot be Makdish something that he does not own.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, Kohanim and Leviyim cannot be Macharim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon says, Kohanim cannot be Macharim, for Cherem is given to Kohanim. (Since he would keep it, it has no effect);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Leviyim can be Macharim, for Cherem is not given to them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> R. Yehudah's opinion is Nir'eh (accepted) regarding land, for it says "Ki Achuzas Olam Hi Lahem";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon's opinion is Nir'eh regarding Metaltelim, for Cherem is not given to Leviyim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Granted, R. Yehudah says that Kohanim cannot be Macharim, for Cherem is given to them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Granted, he says that Leviyim cannot be Macharim land, for it says "Ki Achuzas Olam Hi Lahem";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, why does he say that Leviyim cannot be Macharim Metaltelim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mi'Kol Asher Lo... umi'Sedeh Achuzaso" equates land with Metaltelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why R. Shimon says that Kohanim cannot be Macharim, for Cherem is given to them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We understand why he says that Leviyim can be Macharim Metaltelim. He does not equate Metaltelim to land. (At this point, we are assuming that he holds that Leviyim can be Macharim land, so the latter statement is unnecessary. Even if he equated Metaltelim to land, Leviyim could be Macharim Metaltelim! We answer that Leviyim cannot be Macharim land, so the latter statement is essential.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Why does he say that Leviyim can be Macharim land? It says "Ki Achuzas Olam Hi Lahem"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon said that Leviyim can be Macharim, i.e. Metaltelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Seifa, Rebbi says that R. Yehudah's opinion is Nir'eh regarding land, and R. Shimon's opinion is Nir'eh regarding Metaltelim. This implies that (they argue about both of them, i.e.) R. Shimon discusses also land!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi means that R. Yehudah's opinion is Nir'eh <i>to</i> R. Shimon regarding land, and R. Shimon argues only about Metaltelim, but he agrees about land.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH KOHEN RECEIVES CHEREM?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> If one was Macharim Metaltelim, he may give them to any Kohen he wants. It says "Kol Cherem b'Yisrael Lecha Yihyeh." (Tosfos - really, we do not learn from the verse. He says this from reasoning.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one was Macharim land, he gives it to a Kohen in the present Mishmar (Rambam - at the time of his vow; Chazon Ish - perhaps at the time he gives it), for it says "k'Sedeh ha'Cherem la'Kohen Tihyeh Achuzaso";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Kohen-Kohen" from Gezel ha'Ger. (If Ploni stole from a convert and swore to deny it, and the convert died without heirs, when Ploni repents, he brings an Asham and gives the money and a Chomesh to a Kohen in the Mishmar.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source regarding Gezel ha'Ger?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "La'Shem la'Kohen" teaches that Hash-m acquires it and gives it to a Kohen in the Mishmar;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Ploni can give to any Kohen he wants!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Milvad Eil ha'Kipurim Asher Yechaper Bo Alav" teaches that he gives to a Kohen in the Mishmar (i.e. the one who offered the Asham).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> When land is given to Kohanim in Yovel (one was Makdish his Sedeh Achuzah and did not redeem it), it is given to Kohanim in the Mishmar that begins Yovel (Rambam - Rosh Hashanah; Rashi - Yom Kipur, the day that fields are returned).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Yovel begins on Shabbos (when Mishmaros change), is land given to the Mishmar that is leaving or to the one entering?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Ami):</span> It is given to the Mishmar that is leaving.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for R. Chiya bar <i>Avin</i> - Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Beraisa):</span> The Shemitos of Yovel (i.e. return of land) and Shevi'is (the seventh year, i.e. cancellation of loans) come at the same time, <i>except</i> that Yovel is Meshamet at its beginning, and Shevi'is is Meshamet at its end.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The fact that Yovel (which follows a Shemitah year) is Meshamet at its beginning and Shemitah at its end.is precisely why they take effect at the same time! (Why does it say 'except'?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the Shemitos of Yovel and Shevi'is come at the same time <i>because</i> Yovel is Meshamet at its beginning, and Shevi'is at its end.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Shevi'is is Meshamet at its end, for it says "mi'Ketz Sheva Shanim Ta'aseh Shemitah";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, Yovel is not Meshamet at its beginning (Rosh Hashanah, rather, on Yom Kipur) - "b'Yom ha'Kipurim Ta'aviru Shofar b'Chol Artzechem"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah, who says that Yovel begins on Rosh Hashanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Chizkiyah bar Biloto):</span> We should equate Metaltelim to land, and say that also Cherem of Metaltelim must be given to a Kohen in the Mishmar!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not we equate them. R. Chiya bar Avin holds like R. Shimon, who does not equate them.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TO WHOM CHEREM IS GIVEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chermei Kohanim cannot be redeemed. They are given to Kohanim, like Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah ben Beseira says, Stam (unspecified) Cherem becomes Hekdesh Bedek ha'Bayis - "Kol Cherem Kodesh Kodashim Hu la'Shem";</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chachamim say, Stam Cherem is given to Kohanim - "k'Sedeh ha'Cherem la'Kohen Tihyeh Achuzaso."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Chachamim, why does it say "Kol Cherem Kodesh Kodashim Hu la'Shem"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Cherem takes effect on Kodshei Kodoshim and Kodshim Kalim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If one was Macharim a Neder of Kodshei Kodashim and Kodshim Kalim, he gives its value (what it is worth to him. If it would be lost or stolen, he would have to bring another Korban);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If he was Macharim a Nedavah, he gives his Tovas Hana'ah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he had said "this bull is an Olah," we estimate how much one with no obligation to bring an Olah would pay to bring one (if he could do so cheaply).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>One can be Macharim a Bechor, whether or not it has a Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We estimate how much a Yisrael (Ploni) would pay the Bechor's owner to give the Bechor to Ploni's grandson or nephew (a Kohen).</p></div>
