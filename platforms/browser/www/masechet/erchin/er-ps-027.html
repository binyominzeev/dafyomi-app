<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PERMANENT REDEMPTION OF <i>KOHANIM</i> AND <i>LEVIYIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> No, R. Yehudah and R. Shimon agree that Kinyan Peros is like Kinyan ha'Guf;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> They argue (when Yakov died after Hekdesh) because they expound a verse:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It could have said "Sedeh Miknaso Asher Lo Achuzaso." Rather, it says "<i>mi</i>'Sedeh", to exclude a field that could have become his inheritance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kohanim and Leviyim can be Makdish and redeem at any time...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand the Chidush that they can redeem at any time. This is unlike Yisraelim, who cannot redeem after Yovel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, why does it say that they can be Makdish at any time? The same applies to Yisraelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it teaches that they can be Makdish in Yovel itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Partial) rejection:</span> This answers only for Shmuel, who says that Yisraelim cannot be Makdish in Yovel itself. It does not answer for Rav, who says that even Yisraelim can be Makdish in Yovel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Even according to Shmuel, how do we explain "before or after Yovel"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is not a Chidush. It is merely for parallel structure with the Reisha, which discusses before and after Yovel;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Likewise, since the Reisha discusses being Makdish and redeeming, the Seifa does also.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>HEKDESH</i> WHEN THERE IS NO <i>YOVEL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Makdish his field at a time when Yovel does not apply, we tell him to make the first bid (to redeem it), for only the original owner adds a Chomesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A case occurred in which a man was Makdish his field because it was very bad. They told him to make the first bid. He offered an Isar (eight Perutos, a pittance).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> No, he offered an egg, for Hekdesh can be redeemed for money or for Shaveh Kesef (anything with intrinsic worth).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Gizbar told him "it is yours!" The man had to pay an Isar, and received his field back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> One who is Makdish his field...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we merely <i>tell</i> him to make the first bid?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We <i>force</i> him to make the first bid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah means that we force him to make the first bid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> First we tell him to make the first bid. If he does not, we force him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>(Mishnah):... For only the original owner adds a Chomesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if he did not add a Chomesh, we would tell him to make the first bid. Since his field is dear to him, he will pay more for it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, it is a Mitzvah for the original owner to redeem his field!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Mishnah teaches additional reasons:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He bids first because his field is dear to him, so he will pay more for it. Also, it is a Mitzvah for him to redeem his field. Also, only he adds a Chomesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in which a man was Makdish his field...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about whether one may redeem with Shaveh Kesef;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi allows this, and Chachamim do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Halachah is that Shaveh Kesef is like Kesef! (Below, we learn that the Halachah follows Chachamim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, all agree that Shaveh Kesef is like Kesef. They argue about whether the Chomesh must be worth (at least) a Perutah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that he redeemed for an Isar, and the Chomesh was (even more than) a Perutah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says that he redeemed for an egg, even though the Chomesh was less than a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Gizbar told him "it is yours!" The man had to pay an Isar, and received his field back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>The Seifa is Stam (anonymous), like Chachamim. (This shows that the Halachah follows Chachamim.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DIFFERENT BIDS TO REDEEM <i>HEKDESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one person said "I will redeem this Hekdesh for 10 (Sela'im)," and others successively offered 20, 30, 40 and 50:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the last man retracted, we take a security from his property for 10 (the amount he offered to add to Hekdesh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the others (except for the first) likewise retracted, we take a security from each for 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the first bidder retracted, we sell the Hekdesh for its value, and (if this is less than 10) take a security from his property for the difference (between this and 10).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the Ba'al (original owner) offers 20 and others offer 20, the Ba'al redeems it, for he adds a Chomesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(If the Ba'al offers 20) and someone else offers 21 (or 22, 23, 24 or 25), the Ba'al redeems it for 26 (or 27, 28, 29 or 30);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>(Since he adds a Chomesh of five, his total bid is greater.) He must pay principal as much as the highest bid, but) he adds Chomesh only on his own bid, but not to the Iluy (excess) of others' bids above his own.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If someone else offers 26 --</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Ba'al wants to redeem it for 31 Sela'im and a Dinar, he has precedence. If not, the other redeems it for 26.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara - Rav Chisda):</span> We take a security worth (only) 10 from the one who bid 50 only if the 40-bidder did not retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If also he retracted, (so now Hekdesh will receive only 30), then they share equally the additional loss to Hekdesh (10, and the 50 bidder pays another 10).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If the 40-bidder retracted, we take a security from him for 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rav Chisda, the 50 bidder should pay five of the 10!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> (The Mishnah discusses different cases. The Mishnah teaches that the 40 bidder pays 10) in any case that there was no bidder of 50.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> The Mishnah says that if the 30 (or 20) bidder retracted, he pays 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rav Chisda, the higher bidder(s) should share paying the 10!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> In each of these cases, the Mishnah teaches the obligation of the highest bidder. (I.e. there was no higher bidder.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If the bidder of 10 retracted, we sell the Hekdesh for its value, and take a security from the bidder of 10 for the difference.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Here also, the case is that there was no higher bidder.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it would have said "we take a security from <i>him</i>"! (Since it specifies "the bidder of 10," this shows that there were other bidders.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Questions (g) and (i) - Rav Chisda):</span> In the Mishnah, they retracted one after the other. (The highest bidder retracted first.) I teach about when they retract at the same time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> A Beraisa teaches that if they retracted at the same time, they share the loss to Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> We take a security worth 10. (Everyone pays for the loss he caused!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> We answer like Rav Chisda. (In the Mishnah, they retracted one after the other.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mishnah):</span> If the bidder of 10 retracted, we sell the Hekdesh for its value, and take a security from him for the difference.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> The others share the loss to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Rav Chisda):</span> In the Beraisa, they retracted at the same time. In the Mishnah, they retracted one after the other.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE <i>BA'AL</i> MUST MATCH THE <i>ILUY</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Ba'al offers 20 (... and someone else offers 21, the Ba'al redeems it for 26).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Ba'al redeems it because his total bid (with the Chomesh) is higher than the other's (even though the other's principal is higher than the Ba'al's).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven offers one Sela to redeem his own Ma'aser Sheni, and Shimon offers a Sela and an Isar, Shimon redeems it, because he offered a higher principal. (The Chomesh that Reuven would have had to add is more than Shimon's extra Isar of principal!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> When the money is given to Hekdesh, precedence is given to the highest total bid including the (Ba'al's) Chomesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who redeems Ma'aser Sheni keeps the money himself (to buy food in Yerushalayim and eat it), so precedence is given to the highest principal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If someone else offers 25 (the Ba'al redeems it for 30).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Ba'al redeem it? He can say 'someone else is willing to pay as much as me (with the Chomesh)'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, the Ba'al bid 20 (Sela'im) and a Dinar (a quarter-Sela).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why didn't the Tana mention the Dinar?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was not so precise (he preferred to teach concisely).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> In the Seifa he mentions a Dinar!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If someone else offers 26, if the Ba'al wants to redeem it for 31 and a Dinar, he has precedence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The case is, the Ba'al bid 20 and a Perutah. (It is only one part in 192 of a Dinar. The Tana omitted it for brevity, but he would not omit a Dinar.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Ba'al adds Chomesh only on his own bid, but not on others' Iluy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This is only if the property was not assessed by three people (to be worth what the higher bidder offered). If three assessed it, he adds Chomesh on the Iluy. (According to our text, the coming Beraisa is brought to support Rav Chisda. Tosfos - it is not brought to support him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> The Ba'al adds Chomesh (on his own bid and) on others' Iluy;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Beis Hillel says, he does not add Chomesh on others' Iluy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the property was not assessed, why does Beis Shamai say that he adds?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the property was assessed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rav Chisda hold like Beis Shamai?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the property was not assessed. Beis Shamai is simply stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The property was assessed. We must switch the opinions, Beis Shamai exempts adding Chomesh on the Iluy, and Beis Hillel obligates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, this should have been taught in Maseches Eduyos, with all the places where Beis Shamai is more lenient than Beis Hillel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we must rely on Answer #1.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>IF SOMEONE OUTBID THE <i>BA'AL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If someone else offers 26 (if the Ba'al wants to redeem it for 31 and a Dinar... )</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He need not redeem it if he does not want to, for someone else will pay as much as (in this case, even more than) his total offer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he add a Dinar (if he wants to redeem? He should pay only his bid (20) plus its Chomesh (five) plus the Iluy (six)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Mishnah means that if the Ba'al originally offered an amount (i.e. 21) that will obligate him to give 31 and a Dinar (when we add on its Chomesh and the Iluy), he must do so. If not, he may let the other bidder take it.</p>
