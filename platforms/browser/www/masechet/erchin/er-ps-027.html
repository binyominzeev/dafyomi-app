<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> No, R. Yehudah and R. Shimon agree that Kinyan Peros is like Kinyan ha'Guf;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> They argue (when Yakov died after Hekdesh) because they expound a verse:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It could have said "Sedeh Miknaso Asher Lo Achuzaso." Rather, it says "<i>mi</i>'Sedeh", to exclude a field that could have become his inheritance.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kohanim and Leviyim can be Makdish and redeem at any time...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand the Chidush that they can redeem at any time. This is unlike Yisraelim, who cannot redeem after Yovel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, why does it say that they can be Makdish at any time? The same applies to Yisraelim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it teaches that they can be Makdish in Yovel itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Partial) rejection:</span> This answers only for Shmuel, who says that Yisraelim cannot be Makdish in Yovel itself. It does not answer for Rav, who says that even Yisraelim can be Makdish in Yovel!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Even according to Shmuel, how do we explain "before or after Yovel"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is not a Chidush. It is merely for parallel structure with the Reisha, which discusses before and after Yovel;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Likewise, since the Reisha discusses being Makdish and redeeming, the Seifa does also.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Makdish his field at a time when Yovel does not apply, we tell him to make the first bid (to redeem it), for only the original owner adds a Chomesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A case occurred in which a man was Makdish his field because it was very bad. They told him to make the first bid. He offered an Isar (eight Perutos, a pittance).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Gizbar told him "it is yours!" The man had to pay an Isar, and received his field back.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah means that we force him to make the first bid.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if he did not add a Chomesh, we would tell him to make the first bid. Since his field is dear to him, he will pay more for it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Also, it is a Mitzvah for the original owner to redeem his field!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Mishnah teaches additional reasons:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He bids first because his field is dear to him, so he will pay more for it. Also, it is a Mitzvah for him to redeem his field. Also, only he adds a Chomesh.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one person said "I will redeem this Hekdesh for 10 (Sela'im)," and others successively offered 20, 30, 40 and 50:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the last man retracted, we take a security from his property for 10 (the amount he offered to add to Hekdesh);</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> (The Mishnah discusses different cases. The Mishnah teaches that the 40 bidder pays 10) in any case that there was no bidder of 50.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions:</span> The Mishnah says that if the 30 (or 20) bidder retracted, he pays 10.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> In each of these cases, the Mishnah teaches the obligation of the highest bidder. (I.e. there was no higher bidder.)</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it would have said "we take a security from <i>him</i>"! (Since it specifies "the bidder of 10," this shows that there were other bidders.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Ba'al offers 20 (... and someone else offers 21, the Ba'al redeems it for 26).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Ba'al redeems it because his total bid (with the Chomesh) is higher than the other's (even though the other's principal is higher than the Ba'al's).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> When the money is given to Hekdesh, precedence is given to the highest total bid including the (Ba'al's) Chomesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who redeems Ma'aser Sheni keeps the money himself (to buy food in Yerushalayim and eat it), so precedence is given to the highest principal.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Ba'al redeem it? He can say 'someone else is willing to pay as much as me (with the Chomesh)'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, the Ba'al bid 20 (Sela'im) and a Dinar (a quarter-Sela).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why didn't the Tana mention the Dinar?</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If someone else offers 26, if the Ba'al wants to redeem it for 31 and a Dinar, he has precedence.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The case is, the Ba'al bid 20 and a Perutah. (It is only one part in 192 of a Dinar. The Tana omitted it for brevity, but he would not omit a Dinar.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Ba'al adds Chomesh only on his own bid, but not on others' Iluy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This is only if the property was not assessed by three people (to be worth what the higher bidder offered). If three assessed it, he adds Chomesh on the Iluy. (According to our text, the coming Beraisa is brought to support Rav Chisda. Tosfos - it is not brought to support him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> The Ba'al adds Chomesh (on his own bid and) on others' Iluy;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the property was not assessed. Beis Shamai is simply stringent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The property was assessed. We must switch the opinions, Beis Shamai exempts adding Chomesh on the Iluy, and Beis Hillel obligates.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, this should have been taught in Maseches Eduyos, with all the places where Beis Shamai is more lenient than Beis Hillel!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Mishnah means that if the Ba'al originally offered an amount (i.e. 21) that will obligate him to give 31 and a Dinar (when we add on its Chomesh and the Iluy), he must do so. If not, he may let the other bidder take it.</p></div>
