<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Yehudah learn from Shalmei Tzibur?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to learn Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis from Bedek ha'Bayis, and not from Kodshei Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Shimon learn from a Kodesh house?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to learn a gift to Kohanim (the field) from a gift to Kohanim (Shalmei Tzibur). A house is not a gift to Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> Kohanim neither receive it nor pay...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Elazar's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> He expounds "v'Im Lo Yig'al Es ha'Sadeh... Lo Yiga'el Od," "v'Im Machar Es ha'Sadeh... v'Hayah ha'Sadeh b'Tzeiso va'Yovel."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> It is unreasonable to cut up the verse like this! ("V'Im Machar Es ha'Sadeh" is in the middle of the verse, between "v'Im Lo Yig'al" and "Lo Yiga'el Od"!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> He learns like the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Lo Yiga'el" teaches that it cannot be redeemed at all, even like a Sedeh Miknah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It cannot be redeemed "Od" like it used to be (a Sedeh Achuzah), but it can be redeemed like a Sedeh Miknah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When does this apply?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It applies during the first Yovel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it can be redeemed to be a Sedeh Achuzah again! (Rashi - this is if no one redeemed it yet. Rambam - it is even if someone else redeemed it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It applies during the second Yovel.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is R. Yehudah or R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They say that an unredeemed field is given to Kohanim after the first Yovel!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is R. Elazar. This shows that he learns from "Lo Yiga'el Od."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is unreasonable to explain this way. If so, how do R. Yehudah and R. Shimon expound "Od"?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, the Beraisa refers to a field that a Kohen received it in Yovel, he was Makdish it, and the original owner wants to redeem it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One might have thought that he cannot redeem it, even to be like a Sedeh Miknah. The verse teaches that he cannot redeem it to be his Achuzah again, but he can redeem it like a Sedeh Miknah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "bi'Shnas ha'Yovel Yashuv ha'Sadeh la'Asher Kanahu me'Ito" teaches that (if Reuven bought Shimon's field and was Makdish it, and Levi redeemed it, then in Yovel) it goes back to the Gizbar (Hekdesh), from whom Levi bought it!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "la'Asher Lo Achuzas ha'Aretz." (It returns to Shimon). (We call this Case 1.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need "la'Asher Kanahu me'Ito"?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Reuven bought a field from a Kohen who received it (in Yovel) and Reuven was Makdish it and Levi redeemed it, one might have thought it returns to the original owner in the next Yovel;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>"La'Asher Kanahu me'Ito" teaches that rather, it returns to the Kohen (for it is now his Achuzah). (We call this Case 2.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>The Torah needed to write "Lo Yiga'el" and "la'Asher Kanahu me'Ito";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it written only "Lo Yiga'el," one might have thought that in Case 1 it does not return to the original owner, for it does not return at all, but in Case 2, when it does return, it returns to the original owner;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"La'Asher Kanahu me'Ito" teaches that it returns to the Kohen.</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Lo Yiga'el" teaches that it does not return to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Had it written only "Lo Yiga'el" and not "Od," one might have thought that he cannot redeem it at all. "Od" teaches that he cannot redeem it to be his Achuzah, but he can redeem it to be like a Sedeh Miknah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We still do not have a (satisfactory) answer for Question (f)! (What is R. Elazar's source?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> "V'Hayah ha'Sadeh <i>b'Tzeiso</i> va'Yovel" refers to when it leaves someone else (who redeemed it. Then it is given to Kohanim, but not if it is still Hekdesh).</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 2):</span> (Really, it is like R. Yehudah and R. Shimon.) The Beraisa refers to a field that a Kohen received it in Yovel, he was Makdish it, and the original owner wants to redeem it;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven bought a field from his father Yakov, and was Makdish it after Yakov died, it is considered a Sedeh Achuzah;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Sedeh Miknah, it says "Asher Lo mi'Sedeh Achuzaso", i.e. a field that could not have become his Achuzah. This field could have become his Achuzah. (Had he not bought it, he would have inherited it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>(If one was Makdish) a Sedeh Miknah, it is not given to Kohanim in Yovel, for one (the buyer) cannot be Makdish something that he does not own (with permanent rights to the field).</p></div>
