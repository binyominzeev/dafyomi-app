<p class="dedicationbox">ERCHIN 4 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the twelfth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THINGS THAT APPLY TO ALL MEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa teaches that "everyone is obligated to read the Megilah -- Kohanim, Leviyim and Yisraelim." This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must teach that we interrupt Avodah to hear the Megilah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> All of the following interrupt in order to hear the Megilah -- Kohanim engaging in Avodah, Leviyim singing on the Duchan, Yisraelim at their Ma'amad (representatives of Yisrael to oversee the Avodah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa teaches that "everyone is obligated to (say Birkas ha'Mazon and) make a Zimun - Kohanim, Leviyim and Yisraelim." This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Kohanim ate (their share of) Kodshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Ochlu Osam Asher Kupar Bahem" teaches that their eating is in order to complete the atonement for Yisrael. One might have thought that (Birkas ha'Mazon, and hence) Zimun does not apply to it (because this is not an optional eating - R. Gershom; Rashi - because they do not eat for the sake of satiation; Kli Chemdah - because Mitzvos are not for Hana'ah, and the Hana'ah of eating is Batel to the Mitzvah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"V'Achalta v'Savata (u'Verachta)" teaches that if one was satiated, (in any case) he must bless.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa teaches that "everyone joins to make a Zimun - Kohanim, Leviyim and Yisraelim." This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Kohanim ate Terumah or (Menachos, which are Kodshei) Kodshim (that are forbidden to Zarim), and the Zar ate Chulin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since the Zar could not eat the Kohanim's food, they do not join. The Beraisa teaches that since the Kohanim could eat the Zar's food, they do join.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah teaches that "everyone can be Ma'arich... Kohanim, Leviyim and Yisraelim... " This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Our Mishnah is like Ben Buchri:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah citing Ben Buchri):</span> If a Kohen is Shokel (gives a half-Shekel along with Bnei Yisrael, to buy Korbanos Tzibur), he does not transgress;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> Rather, a Kohen who does not Shokel transgresses! Kohanim (incorrectly) expound the following, to their (monetary) advantage:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"V'Chol Minchas Kohen Kalil Tihyeh Lo Se'achel"- if Kohanim would be Shokel, they would be (joint) owners of (all Korbanos Tzibur, including) the Omer, Lechem ha'Panim and Shtei ha'Lechem, and these could not be eaten!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Ben Buchri, a Kohen who is Shokel transgresses, for the Tzibur will (improperly) buy Korbanos using his half-Shekel. It is Chulin b'Azarah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kohen gives his half-Shekel to the Tzibur, and then it is given to Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of answer #1:</span> One might have thought that since it says "v'Chol Erkecha Yihyeh b'Shekel ha'Kodesh," Erchin applies only to those obligated to give Shekalim, but not to Kohanim. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> We use "v'Chol Erkecha Yihyeh b'Shekel ha'Kodesh" to teach that an Erech is never less than one Shekel (i.e. for an Oni paying according to Heseg Yad (what he can afford))!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Rather, since it says "u'Feduyav mi'Ben Chodesh Tifdeh b'Erkecha," one might have thought that Erchin applies only to those obligated in Pidyon ha'Ben, but not to Kohanim (and Leviyim), who are exempt. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> It also says "v'Es Ashamo Yavi la'Shem Ayil Tamim Min ha'Tzon b'Erkecha." (According to your reasoning,) we should say that only one who can be Ne'erach brings a Korban Asham, but not a Tumtum or Androginus! (Even though in conclusion we do not equate Pidyon ha'Ben to Erchin, so likewise we should not equate Asham to Erchin, we do not find a Mishnah teaching that Tumtum and Androginus indeed bring an Asham.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava or Rav Ashi):</span> It says "v'He'emido Lifnei ha'Kohen." One might have thought that the Ma'arich must be in front of a Kohen, but he himself cannot be a Kohen. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHO IS INCLUDED AND EXCLUDED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah says that everyone can be Ne'erach. We explained that this includes Menuval and Muchas Shechin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #1):</span> "B'Erkecha" includes a Sasum (unspecified) Erech (this will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Also, "b'Erkecha" teaches that one gives the Erech of a full person, and not the Erech of a limb;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies even to limbs essential for life!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Nefashos." (What is essential to life is like the entire Nefesh).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>(Erchin applies to) "Nefashos", but not a Mes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we exclude a Mes, but not a Goses (one who will probably die from his illness)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'He'emido... v'He'erich" teaches that Erchin applies only if the Ne'erach can stand. (This excludes a Goses, who cannot stand. This is like Rashi on Chumash, who explains "v'He'emido (the Kohen is Ma'amid the Ne'erach), v'He'erich Oso (the Kohen evaluates how much of the full Erech the Noder can afford)." Tosfos holds like Rashi said above, that "v'He'erich" means that the Kohen evaluates the wealth of the <i>Ma'arich</i>, and asks how this excludes a Goses from being Ne'erach. Sefas Emes answers that since a Goses can be Makdish, it is unreasonable to expound that he cannot be Ma'arich, therefore we use the verse to teach that he cannot be Ne'erach. The Beraisa now derives other laws from "Nefashos.")</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know that an individual can be Ne'erach. What is the source that 100 people can be Ne'erachim (at the same time)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Nefashos."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know that a man can be Ma'arich a man or woman. What is the source that a woman can be Ma'arich a man or woman?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Nefashos."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>"Nefashos" also includes Menuval and Muchas Shechin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that "Neder b'Erkecha" teaches that Erchin applies precisely to those who can be Nidarim. "Nefashos" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>"V'Hayah Erkecha" teaches that a Tumtum or Androginus can be Nidar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Neder b'Erkecha" teaches that precisely those who can be Ne'erachim can be Nidarim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hayah Erkecha ha'Zachar" excludes a Tumtum or Androginus (even though they can be Nidarim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this teaches that Erech of a male does not apply to them, rather, Erech Nekevah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hayah Erkecha ha'Zachar... v'Im Nekevah Hi" teaches that Erchin applies to a known male or female, not to a Tumtum or Androginus. (We now explain Beraisa #1 from the beginning.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beraisa #1 learns Erech Sasum from "b'Erkecha". What is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #2):</span> If one said "Erech Sasum (i.e. he did not specify a Ne'erach) Alai," he gives the smallest Erech (i.e. of a young girl), which is three Shekalim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he should give the largest Erech (i.e. of an adult male), which is 50 Shekalim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> You may assume only the smallest amount, but not more than this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he should give only one Shekel, for it says "v'Chol Erkecha Yihyeh b'Shekel (singular) ha'Kodesh"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches about Heseg Yad. (One who cannot afford what he pledged must give at least one Shekel.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why do we need the verse? (Reasoning teaches that you may assume only the smallest amount!!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> It teaches that Heseg Yad does not apply to Erech Sasum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he did not specify a Ne'erach, this is like an explicit Neder (Tosfos - to give the smallest Erech. Rashi - this Erech is unlike (regular) Erchin. Since everyone knows what he must give, Heseg Yad does not apply.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The verse teaches that Heseg Yad applies to Erech Sasum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! (Heseg Yad applies to all Erchin.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that this is like an explicit Neder. The verse teaches that this is not so. It has all laws of (regular) Erchin.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>EXPLAINING THE BERAISA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> Also, "b'Erkecha" teaches that one gives the Erech of a full person, but not the Erech of a limb.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already used "b'Erkecha" to teach about Erech Sasum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said "Erech," we would learn only Erech Sasum. The extra final "Chaf" (Rashi; Shitah Mekubetzes - <i>and </i>the extra "Beis") enable us to learn both laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies even to limbs essential for life!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Nefashos", to exclude a Mes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already used "Nefashos" to teach about limbs!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said "Nefesh". Rather, it says "Nefashos" to allow us to learn both laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we exclude a Mes, but not a Goses!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'He'emido... v'He'erich" excludes a Goses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This excludes also a Mes! (Why did we exclude a Mes from "Nefashos" (plural)?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this excludes a Mes. We expound a different law from "Nefashos".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1) Question:</span> We know that an individual can be Ne'erach. What is the source that 100 people can be Ne'erachim (at once)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Nefashos".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know that a man can be Ma'arich a man or woman. What is the source that a woman can be Ma'arich a man or woman?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Nefashos."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "Nefashos" also includes Menuval and Muchas Shechin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already expounded "Nefashos" (to teach about limbs, and that a woman can be Ma'arich, and that one can be Ma'arich 100 at once)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are equal Chidushim. All of them could have been learned from "Nefesh". Therefore, the plural "Nefashos" teaches about Menuval and Muchas Shechin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "V'Hayah Erkecha" teaches that a Tumtum or Androginus can be Nidar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must a verse teach this? If one said "Alai Demai Dekel," he must give its value. Tumtum and Androginus are no worse than a date tree!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava; according to Tosfos 5a - Rabah):</span> This teaches that a Tumtum or Androginus is evaluated bi'Chvodo (if a vital limb was Nidar, the value of the entire person must be given);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that only one who can be Ne'erach is evaluated bi'Chvodo. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Is it really true that one who cannot be Ne'erach is evaluated bi'Chvodo?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said "the head of this slave is Hekdesh," he and Hekdesh are partners in him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he said "the head of this slave is sold to you," he and the buyer are Meshamnim. (Rashi - they are partners in him; Tosfos - we estimate the work he can do with his head alone. This is the buyer's share.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If one said "the head of this donkey is Hekdesh," he and Hekdesh are partners in it. If he said "its head is sold to you," he and the buyer are Meshamnim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If one said "the head of this cow is sold to you," he sold only the head. Even if he said "the head of this cow is Hekdesh," only the head is Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is because a cow's head is often sold by itself in slaughterhouses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> A donkey or cow cannot be Ne'erach, yet it is not evaluated bi'Chvodo!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> The Beraisa teaches also that a slave, who can be Ne'erach, is not evaluated bi'Chvodo!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to the question and counter-question):</span> The Beraisa refers to (an animal Hukdash to buy) Kodshei Mizbe'ach. Evaluation bi'Chvodo applies only to Bedek ha'Bayis.</p></div>
