<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>REDEMPTION OF <i>BAYIS IR CHOMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One may borrow to redeem, one may redeem half at a time;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> One may not borrow to redeem, nor redeem half at a time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Beraisa #1 is like R. Shimon. Beraisa #2 is like Chachamim. (Rashi - the Beraisos discuss one who was Makdish his Sedeh Achuzah. Tosfos - they discuss one who sold a Bayis Ir Chomah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sells a Bayis Ir Chomah, he can redeem it immediately, or any time until 12 months;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>It is like Ribis (interest. The buyer enjoyed free rent for "lending" his money), but it is not Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If the seller died, his son may redeem it (within the year). If the buyer died, the seller may redeem it from the buyer's son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The year is counted from the time of his sale (Rashi - even if the buyer resold it during the year) - "Ad Melos Lo Shanah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Semimah" is extra, to include Chodesh ha'Ibur (the added month in a leap year).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says, it includes the extra 11 days in a solar year above a lunar year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If the seller did not redeem it within the 12 months, it is Chalut (the buyer can keep it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The law of a buyer and one who received a gift are the same, for it says "la'Tzmisus."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> (The first law of) our Mishnah is unlike Rebbi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "Yamim (Tihyeh Ge'ulaso)" teaches that one cannot redeem his house until at least two days after selling it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound "Yamim"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This teaches that the year is counted from day to day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "Ad Tom Shenas Mimkaro."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim use that to teach that we count the year from the sale date, not according to the years of the (age of the) world, which are counted from Rosh Hashanah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One might have thought that he may redeem until the beginning of the day (12 months later) - "Yamim" teaches from hour to hour (until the same time of day). (This is Answer #2 to Question (h).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's source for from hour to hour?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He learns from "Semimah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim use that to include Iburo (this could refer to the extra 11 days in a solar year, like Rebbi in the Mishnah, or Chodesh ha'Ibur).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> In the Mishnah, Rebbi used "Semimah" to teach about Iburo!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rebbi learns from day to day and from hour to hour from "Ad Tom Shenas Mimkaro."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>POTENTIAL <i>RIBIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It is like Ribis...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> It is genuine Ribis, but the Torah permitted it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> Our Mishnah is R. Yehudah, and the Beraisa is Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven owed Shimon 100, and gave his field for collateral and wrote a document saying that if he does not pay by a certain date, Shimon will keep the field:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is permitted only if Reuven eats the produce in the interim. (If Shimon would eat, and Reuven will pay, it was always a loan, and what Shimon ate was Ribis!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah permits even if Shimon eats the produce in the interim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> A case occurred in which R. Elazar ben Azaryah authorized the buyer to eat the produce!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No, the seller ate.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about "potential" Ribis (a transaction dependent on a future event, perhaps it will turn out that it was a loan with Ribis; alternatively - Ribis that results from a sale). R. Yehudah permits it, and Chachamim forbid it.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> No, all forbid potential Ribis. They argue about whether one may take Ribis on condition to return it. (This is also another answer to the contradiction. Rashi - the Tana of the Mishnah holds that it is not called true Ribis, for it was initially a sale. R. Yehudah holds that it is true Ribis, for in the end, he receives. Tosfos - the Mishnah discusses when the buyer returns the rental value if he redeems the house. The Beraisa discusses when he does not return it.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>ZECHUS</i> TO REDEEM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the seller died, his son may redeem it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it says "v'Ish Ki Yimkor Beis Moshav," one might have thought that this does not apply to the son, for he did not sell it. "V'Haysah Ge'ulaso" teaches that this is not so. (Even an heir can redeem.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the buyer died, the seller may redeem it from the buyer's son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it says "la'Koneh Oso," one might have thought that it can be redeemed only from the buyer himself - "v'Hayesah Ge'ulaso" teaches that this is not so (it can be redeemed even from his heir).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The year is counted from the time of his sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> (If the buyer resold it,) do we count "Shanah" (the year) from the first or second sale?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ad Melos Lo Shanah Semimah" teaches that we count from the first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the original owner did not redeem it, to which buyer is it Chalut?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> The first buyer can redeem it from the second (and keep it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> The second buyer keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar holds that since we count from the first sale, this shows that it is Chalut to the first buyer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, what is R. Yochanan's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> The first buyer sold all his rights to the house. (This includes that it will be Chalut to him if it is not redeemed within a year.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE YEAR OF REDEMPTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> If two people bought Batei Ir Chomah, Reuven on the 15th of the first Adar (in a leap year), and Shimon on the first of Adar Sheni, Shimon's house is Chalut on the first of Adar (next year, there will be only one Adar), but Reuven's is not Chalut until Adar 15.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Reuven should be able to say 'since I bought before you, my house should be Chalut before yours!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because Reuven bought during the added month, he must wait an extra month until it is Chalut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> If lambs were born in the flocks of Reuven and Shimon on (respectively) the 15th of Adar Rishon and Rosh Chodesh Adar Sheni, these lambs complete their years (we will explain the significance of this) on the coming Adar 15 and Adar 1, respectively. (Rashi - the case is, the lambs are Bechoros, which should be offered in their first year. R. Gershom - he teaches about when they will be considered rams. A lamb becomes a ram after a year and one month. Alternatively, he teaches about the Goren for taking Ma'aser Behemah, which must be within their first year.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Reuven's lamb was born first. It should finish its year earlier!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it was born during the added month, it needs an extra month.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Aba need to teach both cases?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the extra month is included only regarding Bayis Ir Chomah, for there it says "Semimah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Aba teaches that this applies also to a lamb. We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Shanah-Shanah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It says "Semimah"... Rebbi says, this includes the extra 11 days in a solar year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "Shanah Semimah" teaches 365 days, i.e. a solar year;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Chachamim say, we count 12 months. If it is a leap year, we count also the extra month.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the seller did not redeem it within the 12 months...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "La'Tzemisus" means permanently;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, "la'Tzemisus" includes a gift. (The giver has no right to redeem it after one year. Griz - he redeems it for its current value.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this from "la'Tzemisus"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said "Tzamis". Rather, it says "la'Tzemisus" to allude to something else that is Chalut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> This is unlike R. Meir, who says that a gift is unlike a sale (it does not return in Yovel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> No, it is even like R. Meir. He agrees here, for also he expounds "la'Tzemisus."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan):</span> also regarding return of land in Yovel, Chachamim expound "Tashuvu" to include a gift, and R. Meir argues!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Indeed, the Beraisa is unlike R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>HEKDESH OF A BAYIS IR CHOMAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven was Makdish a Bayis Ir Chomah, he can redeem it at any time;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon redeemed it from Hekdesh, Reuven can redeem it from Shimon until 12 months (Rambam - from the time Shimon redeemed it). If he did not, it is Chalut to Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> "(It is Chalut) la'Koneh Oso", even if he bought from Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It should become Chalut to Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "l'Dorosav". Hekdesh does not have children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Lo Yetzei ba'Yovel"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Safra):</span> If Yovel comes during the year after a Bayis Ir Chomah was sold, one might have thought that the house goes back. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>REDEEMING AGAINST THE BUYER'S WILL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> At first, buyers would hide on the day 12 months were finished (to prevent the seller from redeeming), to be Cholet;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Hillel enacted that the seller can leave the money in a chamber (in Beis Din), and break down the door and re-enter his house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The buyer can retrieve his money whenever he wants.</p>
