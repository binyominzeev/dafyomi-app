<p class="dedicationbox">ERCHIN 14 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the twelfth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #1:</span> The Mishnah discusses Ha'arachah of a Yisrael to (implicitly) teach Rav Yehudah's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may not say "how beautiful is this Nochri!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is like R. Meir, the Mishnah should discuss one who is Ma'arich the nicest Yisrael or the worst Nochri!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses Erchin only of one nation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The (continuation of our) Mishnah discusses "two nations," i.e. (Ones or Mefateh of) the most prestigious Bas Kohen or the lowliest Bas Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are the same nation, just Kohanim have more Kedushah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #2:</span> Since the Seifa discusses (fixed price redemption of) Sedeh Achuzah, which applies only to Yisrael, since Nochrim do not inherit (land in Eretz Yisrael), also the Reisha discusses Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REDEMPTION OF A <i>SEDEH ACHUZAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are leniencies and stringencies of Sedeh Achuzah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Whether one was Makdish Cholas ha'Mechuz (land outside the city - it produces little, for people trample on it, or because of Ayin ha'Ra; Shitah Mekubetzes - sandy land), or the nicest orchard, he redeems it for 50 Shekalim per Beis Kor (an area in which a Kor of barley is sown, 2500 square Amos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was Makdish a Sedeh Miknah (a purchased field), he redeems it for its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer says, the fixed redemption applies also to a Sedeh Miknah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to R. Eliezer,) what is the difference between a Sedeh Achuzah and a Sedeh Miknah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One who redeems his Sedeh Achuzah adds a Chomesh (a quarter of the principal). One who redeems his Sedeh Miknah does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> If one was Makdish a field full of trees, he redeems the trees for their value, and also pays 50 Shekalim (per Beis Kor) for the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Rav Huna holds that one is Makdish b'Ayin Yafeh (generously).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> Whether one was Makdish land just outside the city, or the nicest orchard, he redeems it for 50 Shekalim. (He does not pay extra for the trees!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> The Mishnah discusses Hekdesh of land proper for an orchard (but there are no trees there now).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Beis Zera" teaches about a field in which one plants seeds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include a vineyard, a field of reeds or a tree field?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Sadeh" is any field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> Indeed, the verse teaches that he pays 50 Shekalim <i>for the land</i>, but he must also redeem the trees for their value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one was Makdish three trees spaced out like 10 trees spread over a Beis Kor, he includes the land and trees between them. He redeems them for 50 Shekalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they are spread out more or less densely, or if he did not Makdish all three at once, he did not Makdish the land and trees between them (he redeems the Hekdesh trees for their value);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even if he later was Makdish the land, he redeems the trees according to their value, and the land for 50 Shekalim. (In the Reisha, he pays 50 Shekalim in all. This refutes Rav Huna!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Also in the Reisha, he pays 50 Shekalim, and he must redeem also the trees for their value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since the Seifa says that he must do so, this implies that in the Reisha he need not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is R. Shimon, who says that one is Makdish b'Ayin Ra'ah (stingily):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one makes a field Hekdesh, everything inside becomes Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says only grafted carob and sycamore stumps become Hekdesh. (They nurture greatly from the ground, which is Hekdesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa is not like R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> Even if he later was Makdish the land, he redeems the trees according to their value, and the land for 50 Shekalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We know that R. Shimon follows the time of redemption. Since both are Hekdesh then, the trees should be redeemed Agav (along with) the field!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah and R. Shimon):</span> If one bought a field from his father, and was Makdish it; and his father died, it is now considered a Sedeh Achuzah. (Its redemption is fixed, i.e. 50 Shekalim per Beis Kor);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Asher Lo mi'Sedeh Achuzaso" teaches that a Sedeh Miknah (a purchased field, which is redeemed for its value) is only a field that he could not have inherited. (He would have inherited this field had he not bought it!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Meir says, if one bought a field from his father and was Makdish it after his father died, it is considered a Sedeh Achuzah;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Asher Lo mi'Sedeh Achuzaso" refers to a field that was not inherited when he was Makdish it (but he inherited permanent rights to this field. His purchase was only until Yovel). (end of Beraisa)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yehudah and R. Shimon hold that even if it was Hukdash before the father died, it is called a Sedeh Achuzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is their reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They learn from the verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The verse teaches R. Meir's case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question - Answer #1:</span> They follow the time of redemption (when he already inherited it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question (6) - Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> No, they expound something else in the verse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It could have said "Sedeh Miknaso Asher Lo Achuzaso." Rather, it says "<i>mi</i>'Sedeh" (an exclusion), i.e. only a field that could not become his inheritance.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THINGS REDEEMED FOR THEIR VALUE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If one was Makdish Tarshin (rocky land), he redeems it for its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding fixed redemption it says "Beis Zera." Tarshin is not fitting to be sown.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he did not redeem it before Yovel, it is given to Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding this law it says "Sadeh", i.e. any field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one sold Tarshin, he may redeem it even before two years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse that requires waiting two years says "Mispar Shnei Tevu'os." Tarshin yields no produce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he did not redeem it before Yovel, it returns to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding this law it says "v'Shav la'Achuzaso." Also this is an inheritance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If one was Makdish trees, he redeems them for their value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Beis Zera", which excludes trees.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "v'Hayah ha'Sadeh", to exclude trees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If one sold trees, he may not redeem them before two years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Shnei Tevu'os." Also trees yield produce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If he did not redeem them before Yovel, they do not return to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "v'Shav la'Achuzaso." Trees are not an inheritance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If one was Makdish trees, he redeems them for their value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The land (underneath them) should become Hekdesh Agav (with) them. They should be redeemed Agav the land!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he was Makdish the trees, but not the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Chachamim of Neharda'a taught that one who sells a date tree includes the land from the bottom of the tree down to the depths!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed he was Makdish only the trees. The land is included only when the buyer claims that the seller explicitly stipulated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he was Makdish a Sedeh Miknah, he redeems it for its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Michsas" (the calculation of the redemption of a Sedeh Miknah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (A Sedeh Achuzah the size of) "Zera Chomer Se'orim" is redeemed for 50 Shekalim. One might have thought that the same applies to Sedeh Miknah. "Michsas" teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Eliezer says, it says "v'Chishav" regarding Sedeh Miknah and regarding Sedeh Achuzah. Just like the latter has a fixed redemption, also the former.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do Chachamim agree that there is a Gezeirah Shavah, just they use it to teach about Chomesh? (I.e. one must add a Chomesh when redeeming Sedeh Miknah, just like for Sedeh Achuzah.) Or, do they say that there is no Gezeirah Shavah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Presumably, they say that there is no Gezeirah Shavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Twice, the Torah teaches to add a Chomesh, regarding Sedeh Miknah and one who is Makdish his house. These are Shnei Kesuvim (two verses, one of which teaches something which could have been learned from the other), so they do not teach about other laws. (Tosfos - they do not teach even through Gezeirah Shavah. According to the opinion (that Tosfos cites) that Shnei Kesuvim can teach through Gezeirah Shavah, Rava could mean that it is unreasonable to say that there is a Gezeirah Shavah, for if so (Chomesh applies to every Hekdesh, and) there was no need to write Chomesh in two places. It could have written it once, and we would have learned to all Hekdesh!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since the Torah teaches Chomesh also regarding Ma'aser Sheni and Hekdesh of Tahor and Tamei animals, the same reasoning applies to the opinion that we learn from Shnei Kesuvim. He agrees that we do not learn from three (or more) Kesuvim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>A Beraisa supports Rava's law (that Chomesh does not apply to Sedeh Miknah), but for a different reason;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Michsas ha'Erkecha" equates redemption of Sedeh Miknah to Erchin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like we do not add Chomesh to Erchin, we do not add to redemption of a Sedeh Miknah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OTHER LENIENCIES AND STRINGENCIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are leniencies and stringencies of Shor ha'Mu'ad:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Whether it killed the nicest (most valuable) slave or the worst, the owner pays 30 Shekalim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it killed a Yisrael, the owner pays the victim's value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If it damaged a slave or Yisrael, the owner pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> All these laws apply only to a Mu'ad, but not to a Tam (an animal not established to gore).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Akiva, who says that if a Tam damaged a Yisrael, its owner pays full damage in excess of what the Yisrael damaged the animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Our Mishnah is even like R. Akiva. The Seifa applies even to a Tam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the other clauses apply only to a Mu'ad, the Tana (did not specify otherwise in the Seifa, i.e. he) taught the Seifa only about a Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE PAYMENT FOR <i>BOSHES</i> AND <i>PEGAM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are leniencies and stringencies of Ones and Mefateh (rape or enticement of a virgin):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Whether he raped (or enticed) the most dignified Bas Kohen, or the lowliest Bas Yisrael, he pays 50 Shekalim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The (compensation for) Boshes (embarrassment) and Pegam (loss of virginity) is according to the girl and the rapist. (Boshes is greatest if she is prestigious and he is lowly (Rashi Kesuvos 40a - if he is average). Pegam is greater for a more prestigious (Tosfos Kesuvos 40b; Rambam - prettier) girl.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Torah says only that he pays 50. What is the source to pay Boshes and Pegam?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ze'ira):</span> (The Torah would not say that he pays only 50, for then) people would (justifiably) protest, does one pay the same for the king's daughter like for a commoners' daughter?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> (If a Shor ha'Mu'ad kills any slave, the bull's owner pays 30.) We are not concerned lest people protest 'does one pay 30 for a slave skilled to pierce pearls (to thread them on a string, which is very lucrative) like for one who only sews?!</p>
