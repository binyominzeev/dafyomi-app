<p class="dedicationbox">ERCHIN 18 - Dedicated in honor of Mordechai ben Moshe ha'Kohen, by Josh Rebbi Danziger of Cliffside Park, New Jersey. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>KASHRUS FOR TESTIMONY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Testimony is different. "Oh Ra'ah... Im Lo Yagid" teaches that it depends only on being Kosher at the time of seeing and testifying.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "v'<i>Hu</i>"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If one saw a throng of people and witnesses were among them, and he said "I impose an oath on you that you will testify for me if you know testimony", perhaps they are liable!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hu Ed" exempts. He must specify the witnesses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps even if he said "(I impose an oath on) you who are standing here," they are exempt!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hu Ed" is Mechayev, since he specified the witnesses.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ASSETS THAT DO NOT MAKE ONE AN ASHIR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The law of Korbanos is different...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Ploni's father died, leaving him a fortune, Ploni is an Ashir!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> It means, even if he was going to inherit from his father (he brings Korban Oni).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, his father was Goses (about to die);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since most Gosesim die, it is as if he already died. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says 'even if his ship is coming in with a fortune.' If so, he is an Ashir (even though the money is not here yet)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> The case is, he does not own the cargo. He rented the ship to others.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They owe him the rent! (Therefore, he is an Ashir!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rental is not due until the end of the rental.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He is an Ashir because he owns a ship!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Eliezer:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a farmer owes Erchin, we let him keep his yoked animals. (He gives Erech Oni. He need not sell them, for his income depends on them.) If a donkey-driver owes Erchin, we let him keep his donkey. (Similarly, we leave to Ploni his ship, for for his income is from renting it out.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHAT DETERMINES ERCHIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The years (that determine the Erech) are according to the Nidar:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Yeled (someone between 20 and 60) was Ma'arich an elder (above 60), he pays the Erech of an elder. If an elder was Ma'arich a Yeled, he pays the Erech of a Yeled.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Erchin is according to (the gender of) the Ne'erach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a man was Ma'arich a woman, he pays the Erech of a woman. If a woman was Ma'arich a man, she pays the Erech of a man.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Erech is paid according to (the age at) the time of the Erech:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Reuven was Ma'arich someone less than five (or 20) years, and (before paying) the Ne'erach completed five (or 20) years, Reuven pays according to the time of the Erech.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> (Vows of) Damim are equated to Erchin regarding two things:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A cheap estimation of a pearl. (If it sells for 30 here, it is considered to be worth 30, even if he could sell it for 50 in the city. This affects Heseg Yad and one who vowed to give its value to Hekdesh);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Limbs are judged bi'Chvodo. (If a vital limb was Ne'erach or Nidar, the Erech or Damim of the entire person must be given.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we should equate Erchin to Damim also to evaluate them according to the time of payment! (Rashi - surely, Damim is according to the time of payment, for it is according to the Nidar's slave value. Beis Din did not see the Nidar at the time of the vow, only when the Noder comes to pay! Tosfos - we expound this from a verse.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "K'Erkecha Yakum" teaches that he pays according to the time of the vow. (Tosfos Yom Tov - this verse is written regarding Sedeh Achuzah. We do not need it to teach about Sedeh Achuzah, so it teaches about Erchin.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE YEARS OF ERCHIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (A Ne'erach on) the 30th day is like before the 30th day (he has no Erech). During the fifth year is like before the fifth year. (The Erech is like under five years.) During the 20th year is like before the 20th year;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Im mi'Ben Shishim Shanah va'Ma'alah" teaches about all other years. During the 60th year is like before 60 (only Shishim va'Ma'alah, i.e. after 60 years are completed, is like after 60). The same applies to years five and 20.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It is a stringency to consider during the 60th year like before 60 (this obligates paying the biggest Erech). We cannot learn to years five and 20, for then it is a leniency!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Shanah- Shanah" from year 60 to years five and 20. During the year is like before the year, whether this is a stringency or leniency.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, one does not enter the next age bracket until a month and a day into the next year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> We must say that the Gezeirah Shavah is Mufneh (both words are extra, therefore we do not challenge the Gezeirah Shavah). If not, we would challenge it like in the Mishnah! (We would not learn a leniency from a stringency.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this is true. There was no need to repeat "Shanah" every time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike Rebbi, who says that "Ad" (until) does not include (the ending point, as follows):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "mi'Yom ha'Rishon Ad Yom ha'Shevi'i" (one who eats Chametz from the first day of Pesach until the seventh gets Kares) does not apply to days one and seven!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We find so regarding a Metzora. He becomes Tahor if the Tzara'as spreads "mi'Rosho v'Ad Raglav", and this does not include the head or the legs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ad Yom ha'Echad v'Esrim la'Chodesh ba'Arev" (teaches that there is Kares also for the seventh day).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rebbi says, we need not learn from another verse. Yom Rishon and Yom ha'Shevi'i are included (because it says "Ad").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Our Mishnah is even like Rebbi. The connotations of the verses contradict each other, therefore we cannot learn from them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "mi'Ben Chodesh v'Ad Ben Chamesh Shanim." (This should include the fifth year like less than five). It says also "mi'Ben Chamesh v'Ad... "! (This implies that the fifth year is like more than five.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Mi'Rosho v'Ad Raglav" does not include the head or the legs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Simanim of Tum'ah of (Tzara'as of) the head (e.g. fine yellow hairs) are different than those of the foot (white hairs);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Tzara'as does not apply to the head and foot, for we cannot fulfill "l'Chol Mar'e Einei ha'Kohen." (R. Gershom - they cannot be seen at the same time. Rashi - he cannot see the scalp under the hair, nor between the toes. Shitah Mekubetzes - the sole is not seen, for one is always stepping on it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> One does not enter the next age bracket until a month and a day into the next year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> It says (regarding Erech of an elder) l'Ma'alah, like it says regarding (counting) Leviyim (Rashi; Tosfos - Pidyon ha'Ben);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like there, we require a month and a day, also here. ('Above 60' means a month and a day after 60 full years.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> There, "l'Ma'alah" only adds one day to what is explicitly written (a month). We should say the same here!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Gezeirah Shavah would not teach anything.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THINGS THAT MUST BE FULL YEARS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All of the following are full years me'Es l'Es:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The years specified for (certain) Korbanos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The year in which one may redeem a house sold in a walled city;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The two years one must wait before redeeming a field that he sold;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The six years that an Eved Ivri serves;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The years of a boy or girl. (This will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the years of Korbanos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> "Keves Ben <i>Shenaso</i>" teaches that it must be in <i>its</i> first year. (It need not be in the same calendar year, i.e. from Rosh Hashanah until Rosh Hashanah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the year to redeem a house?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ad Tom Shenas <i>Mimkaro</i>" is the year of <i>its</i> sale.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the years before redeeming a field?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "b'Mispar Shnei Sevu'os Yimkar Lach." ("Shnei" is extra, for Sevu'os connotes two. It) teaches that all the harvests of the two years are included, even if there are three. (I.e. he bought the field laden with produce, and twice harvests what he himself grew, and it ripened in the same season.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the six years of an Eved Ivri?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Shesh Shanim Ya'avod <i>uva'Shevi'is</i>" teaches that he also works in the seventh (calendar) year (if he was sold in the middle of a calendar year).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The years of a boy or girl must be full.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Gidal citing Rav):</span> It refers to the years of Erchin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> It refers to the Mishnayos in Perek "Yotzei Dofen" (in Maseches Nidah, which discuss the ages for Nedarim and relations).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye (to Rav Yosef):</span> Do you argue with Rav Gidal (regarding the Halachah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> No. We agree that all of these must be full years. (We argue only about what the Beraisa refers to.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> Rav Gidal must agree. He cited Rav, who says that all the years in Perek Yotzei Dofen are full!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav Gidal say that "boy or girl" refers to the years in Yotzei Dofen?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, it resembles everything else in the Beraisa, in which the years are explicit in the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav Yosef say that the Beraisa refers to Erchin?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said "Zachar Oh Nekevah," the phrase used in the Parshah of Erchin.</p></div>
