<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EVADING SNAKES ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>In Pumbadisa, a [Yisrael] officer of the king was bitten by a snake; there were 13 white donkeys in the city, all were found to be Treifah. There was another at the other end of the city - by the time they brought it, he was eaten by a lion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Perhaps he was bitten by a 'snake' (excommunication) mid'Rabanan, for which there is no cure - "U'Foretz Gader Yishchenu Nachash".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Abaye was told that this was correct - when Rav had died, Rav Yitzchak bar Bizna decreed that [for a year] no one should bring to a wedding myrtle or date branches with bells, and this man did so - therefore, he was bitten by a snake and died from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If a snake wraps itself around a person, he should go near water, put a basket over his head and slowly lower it over himself; so it will separate between him and the snake. When the snake goes onto the basket, he throws the basket into the water and flees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If a snake is angry at a person [and chasing him] - if another person is there, he should carry the pursued one for four Amos (the snake will lose track of the smell of the footsteps of its target);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, he should jump over a ditch of water;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If not, he should cross a river, and at night put his bed on four barrels and sleep under the stars (without a roof); he ties a cat to each leg of the bed, and surrounds the area with twigs, so the cats will hear the snake's coming and eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If a snake is chasing a person, he should run through sand (snakes cannot go quickly there).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If a woman sees a snake and does not know whether or not it desires her (for relations), she should remove her garments and put them in front of it - if it wraps itself in them, this shows that it desires her; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What solution is there [if it desires her]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> She should have relations [with her husband] in front of it (she will become disgraced in its eyes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Others say, just the contrary - this will make it desire her even more!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> She should throw some of her hair and fingernails in front of it and say 'I am Nidah'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If a snake entered [the Ervah of] a woman, she should widen her legs as much as possible, roast meat and bring cress and fragrant wine - when it smells them it will come out;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She grabs it with tongs and burns it - if not, it will return to her.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EATING AND DRINKING FOR A CURE ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may eat <i>any</i> food [or drink any drink for a cure].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This includes spleen to heal teeth and vetch for the intestines. (Even though people usually do not eat these, for spleen is bad for the intestines and vetch is bad for teeth, so it is evident that he eats for a cure, it is permitted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'any drink' come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This includes caper-berry juice with vinegar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> May one drink urine on Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Mishnah):</span> One may drink any drink - people do not drink urine [except for a cure].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Except for Mei Dekalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Except for Mei Dekarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Tana of the Beraisa calls it Mei Dekarim because it is Doker (pierces) the gallbladder; the Tana of the Mishnah calls it Mei Dekalim because it exudes between two date trees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Beruna):</span> There are two date trees in Eretz Yisrael, a spring exudes between them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One cup of the water loosens (the bowels), a second cup causes diarrhea, a third cup leaves the body just like it entered (the intestines are totally empty).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> I drank beer of Bavel - it worked better than Mei Dekalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if one did not have it for 40 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Zeisum ha'Mitzri [is Mei Dekarim, it pierces the sickness - it] is a third barley, a third saffron, and a third salt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> It is a third wheat, a third saffron, and a third salt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>A way to remember who said which - Sisni (a basket for dates - the letter Samech occurs twice in this word, to connect Rav Yo<i>S</i>ef with <i>S</i>e'orim (barley - Samech and Sin are interchangeable).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>One should drink it between Pesach and Shavu'os - it loosens one who is constipated, and constipates one who has diarrhea.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...Or a cup of Ikarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a cup of Ikarim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> One takes the weight of a Zuz of sap of Alexandria, and of alum, and of Oriental safflower, grates them together:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Zavah drinks all three in wine, it will cure her without causing sterility;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For jaundice, one drinks two of them in beer, it causes sterility.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ALTERNATIVE CURES FOR A <i>ZAVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>An alternative cure for a Zavah is to bring three jugs (each holding three Lugim) of Persian onions and cook them in wine; she drinks it, one says to her 'Get up from your Zivah'!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">110b----------------------------------------110b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Alternatively, she should sit at the crossroad and holding a cup of wine; someone goes in back of her and scares her, and says to her 'Get up from your Zivah'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Alternatively, one takes one handful of cumin, one of saffron, one of fenugreek, cooks them in wine, gives to her to drink, and says 'Get up from your Zivah'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Alternatively, one soaks 60 corks [of barrels of wine] in water, rubs them on her, and says 'Get up from your Zivah'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Alternatively, one cooks fern in wine, rubs them on her, and says 'Get up from your Zivah'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Alternatively, one burns a certain herb that grows amidst thorns, carries the ashes in a worn out linen garment in summer [or in a worn out cotton garment in winter];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If not, one digs seven pits and burns in them seven young vines of Orlah; she takes a cup of wine in her hand, and sits on one after the other, each time one says to her 'Get up from your Zivah'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Alternatively, one anoints her bottom half with fine flour and says 'Get up from your Zivah'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Alternatively, she burns an ostrich egg, and carries the ashes in a worn out linen garment in summer [or in a worn out cotton garment in winter];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Alternatively, one opens a barrel of wine for her [to drink a lot];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Alternatively, she should take barley from the dung of a white mule:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she takes it one day, the blood will stop for two days; if she takes it two days, the blood will stop for three days; if she takes it three days, the blood will stop forever.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CURES FOR JAUNDICE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>For jaundice, he drinks two [of the ingredients in a cup of Ikarim] in beer; it causes sterility.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Alternatively, he cooks a salted head of a certain fish in beer and drinks it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Alternatively, one brings brine of grasshoppers [or of Nekiri (small birds), if grasshopper brine is unavailable] to the bathhouse, and rubs him with it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If there is no bathhouse, he stands between the oven and the wall (he will sweat due to the heat, the sickness will leave).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one wants to warm the Choleh, he should wrap him in his garment (or the garment of someone else with jaundice)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Acha bar Yosef had jaundice; Rav Kahana cured him using the garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Alternatively, he brings three jugs of Persian dates, three of wax that drips from an overflowing hive and three of red aloe, cooks them in beer, and drinks it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Alternatively, he brings a male donkey born from a donkey, shaves the middle of its head, draws blood from its forehead and puts it on [the shaved part of] the head, being careful to avoid the eyes, lest he blind them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Alternatively, he brings the head of a ram pickled in vinegar or brine, cooks it in beer and drinks it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Alternatively, he brings a spotted pig, tears it, and puts it over his heart;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Alternatively, he takes leeks from the middle of the patch.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>An Aravi had jaundice; he told a gardener 'Take my garment, and give me a patch of leeks'; the gardener accepted. He ate the leeks, and asked to borrow the garment to sleep in. While sleeping, the sickness left him, and the heat tore the garment into many pieces.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>For jaundice, he drinks two in beer; it causes sterility.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chanina):</span> It is forbidden to castrate a person - we read "U<i>v</i>'Artze<i>chem</i> Lo Sa'asu" like 'Bachem Lo S<i>e</i>'asu' (do not become sterile).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is forbidden to intentionally castrate - here, he intends to be cured, the castration results by itself:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> To castrate a rooster, one shears its mane, it is castrated by itself:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Ashi taught, it is not really castrated - it merely mourns the loss of its glory (but one may not even cause castration)!</p>
