<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>REBBI SHIMON'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (that Rav holds like R. Yehudah):</span> Rav taught that one may leave a Ner on a date tree to burn on Shabbos, but not on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he holds like R. Yehudah, we understand the difference (on Yom Tov, he might take the Ner, thereby using the tree, which is forbidden mid'Rabanan - we are not concerned for this on Shabbos, for even after a Ner extinguishes one does not move it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if he holds like R. Shimon, who permits a moving a Ner that went out on Shabbos, the same concern applies on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The following shows that Rav does not hold like R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav was asked if one may remove a Ner Chanukah lest it be seen by Chaverim (a nation amidst the Parsim that decreed against it) - he permitted it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sha'as ha'Dechak (pressed circumstances) in an exception.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support - Question (Rav Kahana and Rav Asi):</span> Is this really the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> In Sha'as ha'Dechak, we may rely on R. Shimon's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If one planted wheat in the ground, or put an egg under a hen, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps R. Shimon permits Muktzeh only when one was not Docheh b'Yadayim (overtly show that he does not intend to use the item), but when he was Docheh b'Yadayim, he forbids;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he permits in any case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> R. Shimon forbids only oil in a burning lamp, for it was Huktzah (set aside) for the Mitzvah (Ner Shabbos) <i>and</i> (Tosfos ha'Rosh adds this word to the text) Huktzah on account of Isur (one may not take it, lest he extinguish).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon forbids Muktzeh for the Mitzvah [alone]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Sukah had the proper amount of Sechach, and one adorned it with colorful illustrated curtains and sheets, and hung nuts, peaches, almonds, pomegranates, twigs with grapes clusters, crowns on ears [of grain], wines, oils and flour, it is forbidden to use [or eat] them until after Simchas Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he stipulated [that he may use them during Bein ha'Shemashos of the first night], it works (they are permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that this Beraisa is like R. Shimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chiya bar Yosef recited the following Beraisa in front of R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> On Yom Tov, one may not take wood from a hut, only from wood nearby;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Shimon permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>On Sukos, all agree that one may not take from a Sukah for the Mitzvah; if he stipulated, the stipulation works.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan meant, R. Shimon forbids [on account of Muktzeh] only things like oil in a [burning] lamp - since it was Huktzah for the Mitzvah, it is Huktzah regarding Isur (one may not move it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (R. Chiya bar <i>Aba</i> citing R. Yochanan):</span> R. Shimon forbids only things like oil in a burning lamp - since it was Huktzah for the Mitzvah, it is Huktzah regarding Isur (Me'iri - it was Huktzah for the Mitzvah <i>or</i> Huktzah on account of Isur).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Shimon forbids [on account of Muktzeh] only [figs and grapes left to become] dry figs and raisins [for they are not fit to eat when they are partially dried].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He forbids other things also!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was eating figs or grapes and brought the leftovers to the roof to make dry figs or raisins, he may not eat them [on Shabbos] unless he was Mezamen (declared intent to eat) them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The same applies to peaches, quince and all species.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is not R. Yehudah - he forbids Muktzeh even if he was not Docheh b'Yadayim, and all the more so when he was Docheh b'Yadayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question l:3):</span> Really, it is like R. Yehudah, he teaches a Chidush concerning eating;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since he was eating, Hazmanah is not required - the Beraisa teaches, this is not so - once he puts them on the roof, he ceases to think about them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimon bar Rebbi):</span> What is R. Shimon's opinion about [detached] unripe dates [that ripen by themselves]?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> R. Shimon forbids only dry figs and raisins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi does not permit [all other cases of] Muktzeh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not give to drink (Rashi - to facilitate flaying; Rambam - to clear the lungs of things that look like blisters that make it Treifah) and slaughter Midbariyos (wilderness animals); one may give to drink and slaughter Baisos (domestic animals):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Midbariyos are animals that go away [to the wilderness] at Pesach, and return at the first rainy season [in Cheshvan, the start of winter]; Baisos are those graze outside the Techum (outskirts of the city) during the day, and spend the night within the Techum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi says, both of these are Baisos - Midbariyos are those that graze in the dirt and never enter civilization, not in summer nor winter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Midbariyos are just like dry figs and raisins (he keeps them in a place where it will be an exertion to get them, showing that he does not intend to use them - R. Shimon admits in such cases);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rebbi explained [to his son] the opinion of R. Shimon - he himself disagrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> [In the Beraisa] Rebbi addresses Chachamim according to their reasoning, he himself disagrees:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I permit Muktzeh - granted, you forbid Muktzeh, but you should agree that animals that go away at Pesach and return in winter are Baisos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim call these Midbariyos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LIKE WHOM DOES R. YOCHANAN RULE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> [In the Beis Medrash] they said that the Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But an elder asked R. Yochanan whether or not one may move a hen's nest, and he answered, it is solely for chicks (it is forbidden, like a Kli she'Melachto l'Isur (its normal usage is forbidden on Shabbos)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, there is a dead chick inside (R. Shimon agrees that it is Muktzeh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Mar bar Ameimar, who says that R. Shimon agrees that if an animal [that was healthy before Shabbos] died on Shabbos, it is Muktzeh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But according to Mar brei d'Rav Yosef, who says that R. Shimon permits even this, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, there is an egg inside (it is forbidden on account of Nolad (something that came into existence on Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Nachman taught that the opinion (R. Yehudah) that forbids Muktzeh forbids Nolad, the opinion (R. Shimon) that permits Muktzeh permits Nolad!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The case is, in the nest is an egg with a chick inside (it is not fit even for a dog, R. Shimon agrees that it is Muktzeh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> R. Yochanan says that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah, R. Yehoshua ben Levi says that it follows R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> This is why Rabah bar bar Chanah cited R. Yochanan to say '<i>They</i> said that the Halachah follows R. Shimon' - R. Yochanan himself disagrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> You should have known this before hearing R. Yitzchak's teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Aba and R. Asi visited R. Aba of Chaifa; a Menorah fell on R. Asi's garment [on Shabbos] - he did not move it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Surely, this was because R. Asi was a Talmid of R. Yochanan, and R. Yochanan holds like R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> We cannot learn from there, a Menorah is different (even R. Shimon forbids)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> One may move a Menorah that can be held in one hand, but not one that requires two hands;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One may move a [used] Ner, like R. Shimon, but not a Menorah, whether it is held in one or two hands;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> This is because a person fixes a place for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> A person fixes a place for Kilas Chasanim (a canopy over a bed, it is supported on a beam in the middle and slopes down on both sides), yet Shmuel permits to spread the covering or take it down on Shabbos!</p>
