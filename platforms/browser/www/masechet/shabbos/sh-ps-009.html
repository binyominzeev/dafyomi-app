<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE STATUS OF THE THRESHOLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Others):</span> The status of the threshold alternates - when the door is open, it is like inside [the house, Reshus ha'Yachid];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the door is closed, it is like outside (Reshus ha'Rabim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this even if there is no Lechi? (A Lechi (vertical post) helps permit carrying in an open Mavuy, either because it demarcates the end of the Mavuy, or because it is considered a Mechitzah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But Rav taught, to permit carrying in the opening (i.e. even with the thickness of a Lechi which ends at the end] of the Mavuy, a second Lechi is needed (totally outside the Mavuy, for a Lechi only permits carrying from its inner end; the threshold is like the opening of a Mavuy!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The threshold is less than four by four.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav taught, even if the opening is less than four by four, a second Lechi is needed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> Others discuss the threshold of a Mavuy [permitted by a Korah, a beam over the entrance], only the inner half is covered [by the Korah] - when the door is open, it is like inside [Rav permits carrying under the Korah];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the door is closed, it is like outside (a Korah does not permit an area less than four by four).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Really, it discusses the threshold of a house - the case is, there are two Koros less than three Tefachim apart, and the door is in the middle;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the door is open, it is like inside - Lavud joins the Koros, so they are like one roof that is four wide, Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem (the outer edge is considered a Mechitzah, as if it descends to the floor).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When the door is closed, it is like outside - we cannot join the Koros through Lavud.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the threshold is 10 tall and four wide, it is a Reshus [ha'Yachid] unto itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This supports R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> R. Meir says, whenever there are two Reshuyos [ha'Yachid)= by each other, such as a pillar 10 tall and four wide standing in Reshus ha'Yachid, it is forbidden to adjust a load on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is a decree, lest one do so on a mound (10 tall and four wide, which is Reshus ha'Yachid) in Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS FORBIDDEN BEFORE <i>MINCHAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are forbidden from shortly (a half-hour) before the time of Minchah, until praying:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To begin a haircut from a barber, to enter the bathhouse or a tannery, to eat, to judge;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one began, he need not stop.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We stop to say Shma, but not for prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Before which Minchah are these forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They are forbidden before Minchah Gedolah (which starts half an hour after noon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why should these be forbidden - there is plenty of time to finish them and pray afterwards!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They are forbidden before Minchah Ketanah (which starts three and a half hours after noon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">.Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah refutes R. Yehoshua ben Levi!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> It is forbidden to eat anything once the time of Minchah arrives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Defense of Answer #1):</span> Really, they are forbidden before Minchah Gedolah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to Objection (d)):</span> (The Mishnah discusses elaborate activities which could last the entire afternoon) - it refers to the haircut of Ben El'asa (like that of the Kohen Gadol, in which each hair reaches to the next), and to a big tannery (with many skins, at the beginning of their tanning), and to the full works in the bathhouse (shampoo, rinsing in hot and cold water, and a steambath), and eating a big meal (e.g. at a wedding), and to the beginning of judgment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Objection (d) - Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> The Mishnah discusses a normal haircut - Chachamim decreed not to start before prayer, lest the scissors break;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A mere steambath is forbidden, perhaps he will grow faint and be unable to pray;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>One may not peruse his skins in a tannery (even in the middle of tanning), lest he see that he will suffer a loss, and will be upset and unable to pray;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>One may not begin even a small meal, lest it get drawn out;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>One may not even finish judgment before praying, lest he will see a reason to change the verdict [and will start to judge anew].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered the beginning of a haircut (after which it is permitted to continue)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avin):</span> It is from when the barber puts the smock on the customer's knees (Aruch - from when the customer puts his turban on his knees).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered the beginning of a bath?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is from when he removes his cloak (Rashi - his outermost garment; Rambam - his undergarment).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered the beginning of entering the tannery?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is from when he rolls up his sleeves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered the beginning of eating?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It is from when he washes his hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina):</span> It is from when he unties his belt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> R. Chanina discusses the law in Bavel (where people used to gird themselves tightly, one must untie his belt before eating), Rav discusses the law in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>EATING BEFORE PRAYING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye - many change this to say Ze'iri, for Abaye lived in Bavel):</span> For our colleagues in Bavel, according to the opinion that Tefilas Ma'ariv is optional (Tosfos - i.e. one need not strive to fulfill it as much as other Mitzvos), if one untied his belt [to eat before praying Ma'ariv, even though this is forbidden l'Chatchilah], since it would be a toil to tie it again, he may eat before praying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The opinion that Ma'ariv is obligatory requires him to retie it and pray Ma'ariv before eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But all agree that Minchah is obligatory, and the Mishnah permits one to finish eating if he began, and R. Chanina taught that this is once he untied the belt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We are more stringent regarding Ma'ariv for it is common for a person to get drunk at night, therefore there is more danger that if he eats first he will miss praying - there is less concern for this regarding Minchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We are more lenient regarding Minchah because the time to pray is limited, people fear missing it, they are not prone to delay praying - since one may pray Ma'ariv the entire night, people do not fear missing it, and they are prone to delay it.</p>
