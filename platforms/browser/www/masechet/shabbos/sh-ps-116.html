<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE PARSHA OF <i>VA'YEHI BINSO'A</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are Simanim (an inverted Nun before and after) Parashas "Va'Yhi bi'Nso'a ha'Aron", to teach that this is not its proper place;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rebbi says, there are Simanim because this Parashah itself is a Sefer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like which Tana is the following teaching?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "Chatzvah Amudeha Shiv'ah" - these are the seven Seforim of the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like Rebbi (from the beginning of Bamidbar until "Va'Yhi bi'Nso'a", Parashas "Va'Yhi bi'Nso'a", and the rest of Bamidbar count like three Seforim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana that argues with Rebbi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Ultimately, Parashas "Va'Yhi bi'Nso'a" will be uprooted from here and written in its proper place;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It was written here to separate between two punishments of Benei Yisrael - the latter was "Va'Yhi ha'Am k'Mis'onanim" (they complained about the journey, and Hash-m killed some of them] ;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The former was "Va'Yis'u me'Har Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chama bar Chanina):</span> They veered from Hash-m (Rashi - they started lusting for meat (even though this is written <i>after</i> Va'Yhi ha'Am k'Mis'onanim. Tosfos - they were eager to leave Sinai lest they get more Mitzvos. Maharsha - we expound this, for it is not called Har Hash-m anywhere else. The punishment was that the Aron was distanced three days from Benei Yisrael, corresponding to three days in which they did not learn.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the proper place for this Parashah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It belongs by the Degalim (grouping of the Shevatim into four sets of three).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DO WE SAVE <i>GILYONIM</i> OF <i>SEFARIM</i> ON SHABBOS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we save Gilyonim (blank areas of parchment) of a Sefer from a fire?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> If 85 intact letters can be found in a deteriorated Sefer Torah, like Parashas "Va'Yhi bi'Nso'a ha'Aron", we may save it from a fire; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We may not save it on account of the margins!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A deteriorated Sefer Torah is different (once it deteriorated, also the margins lost their Kedushah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If the letters in a Sefer Torah were erased, if 85 intact letters can be found, like Parashas "Va'Yhi bi'Nso'a ha'Aron", we may save it from a fire; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We may not save it on account of the parchment that used to be written on!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We do not ask about the parchment that used to be written on - surely, its Kedushah is on account of the writing, when the writing departs, its Kedushah departs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We ask about the margins above and below, between Parshiyos, between columns [of text], and at the beginning and end of a Sefer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Even so, the Beraisa answers our question (we save only on account of 85 letters, not on account of these margins)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The case is, all of these margins were cut off [only the parchment that used to be written on remained].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mishnah):</span> (Chachamim decreed that Kisvei ha'Kodesh are Metamei hands (above, 14A).) The margins above and below, between Parshiyos, between columns, and at the beginning and end of a Sefer are Metamei hands. (This shows that they have Kedushas Sefer!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps that is only when the writing is intact (we ask about after the writing was erased).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa):</span> One may not save Gilyonim or Sifrei Minim (those written by heretics) from a fire, we let them burn, with the Azkaros (names of Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to Gilyonim of a proper Sefer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it refers to Gilyonim of Sifrei Minim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may not save Sifrei Minim, there is no need to say that one may not save their Gilyonim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, Sifrei Minim are like Gilyonim (blank parchments that were never written on).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not save Gilyonim or Sifrei Minim from a fire;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Yosi says, on a weekday one cuts out the Azkaros and buries them, the rest we burn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> I swear, if I find one I will burn it with the Azkaros!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one is pursued by one who wants to kill him or by a snake, one may enter a house of idolatry, but not a Min's house - idolaters do not recognize Hash-m and deny Him (this is how they were raised), Minim recognize Hash-m and deny Him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says about Minim "V'Achar ha'Deles veha'Mezuzah Samt Zichronech" (they remember Hash-m and cast Him aside).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>R. Yishmael says, we learn from a Kal va'Chomer - to make Shalom between a man and his wife (a Sotah suspected of adultery) the Torah commands to erase Hash-m's name, which was written in Kedushah, into water - Minim, who arouse envy and animosity between Yisrael and Hash-m, all the more so their Azkaros should be eradicated - "Mesan'echa Esna uvi'Skomemecha Eskotat; Tachlis Sin'ah Seneisim".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Just like we do not save them from a fire, we do not save them [even during the week] from a house that collapsed, from water, or anything [else] that will destroy them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>REFUTING HERETICS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Yosef bar Chanin):</span> Do we save Seforim of Beis Avidan (debates between Minim and Yisrael)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Avahu could not give a definitive answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav would not go to Beis Avidan, all the more so not to Beis Nitzrefei (a particular house of idolatry);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Shmuel would not go to Beis Nitzrefei, but he would go to Beis Avidan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>People asked Rava why he doesn't go to Beis Avidan; he attributed this to a date tree in the way. They offered to uproot it; he said that still, it would be difficult to pass through the area (a very frail excuse).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Mar bar Yosef knew the people there, he did not fear to go - once, he went and was almost killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Eliezer's wife, Eima Shalom, was the sister of R. Gamliel. One of their neighbors was a Min who publicized that he judges without taking bribes (he took covertly). They wanted to mock him (publicly expose him).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">116b----------------------------------------116b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>She brought to him a gold lamp; she said that she wants to inherit a share of her father's estate - he authorized this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> Our Torah says that a daughter does not inherit when there are sons!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">The Min:</span> From when Yisrael were exiled, Torah was taken from you, a new Sefer was given to you - it says that daughters and sons inherit equally.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The next day R. Gamliel brought to him a donkey of Luva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">The Min:</span> The end of the new Sefer says 'I do not come to detract nor add to the Torah of Moshe', and Moshe's Torah says that a daughter does not inherit when there are sons!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Eima Shalom:</span> Let your wisdom illuminate like a lamp (remember the bribe I gave to you)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> The donkey knocked over the lamp (my bribe overcame yours)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE PROHIBITION AGAINS READING <i>KISVEI HA'KODESH</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not read in them [for this draws people away from the Beis Medrash].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> It is forbidden only at the time of [the lecture in] the Beis Medrash - at other times one may read them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is forbidden even at other times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Shmuel was the Chacham of Neharda'a, and in Neharda'a they would learn Kesuvim on Shabbos afternoon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 - Correction:</span> Rather, Rav forbids only in a Beis Medrash [where a Chacham teaches] - in other places he permits;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> At the time the Chacham teaches, it is forbidden in the Beis Medrash and outside; when he is not teaching it is permitted everywhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is consistent with the custom in Neharda'a to learn Kesuvim on Shabbos afternoon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The original version was correct - Shmuel holds like R. Nechemyah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even though Chachamim forbid reading Kisvei ha'Kodesh, one may expound them; if one needs to see a verse, he may bring the Sefer and read it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Nechemyah says, they forbade reading Kisvei ha'Kodesh in order that people will reason - if it is forbidden to read Kisvei ha'Kodesh, all the more so secular documents are forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>DO WE ALLOW SAVING MORE THAN WHAT IS ESSENTIAL?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may save the case of a Sefer or Tefilin with the Sefer or Tefilin, even if there are coins inside;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To where may we [take them to] save them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We may take them to a Mavuy (alleyway) that is not Mefulash (open - this will be defined);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ben Beseira):</span> We may take them even to a Mavuy Mefulash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah):</span> If Erev Pesach is on Shabbos, the Korban Pesach is flayed until the chest (on Shabbos), the rest is flayed at night;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, it is flayed entirely on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand R. Yishmael - he allows only what is necessary for the Avodah (to remove the Eimurim (e.g. Chelev) that are burned on the Mizbe'ach);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why do Chachamim permit flaying it entirely?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> "Kol Po'al Hash-m la'Ma'anehu" (we do whatever is necessary to honor Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does flaying it entirely honor Hash-m?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> This [cools the meat, which] prevents it from rotting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> It would be dishonorable if Kodshei Hash-m lied around [half-flayed] like a carcass.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If the animal was on a gold table, it would not be dishonorable, but there is still concern lest it rot.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> On a day when the north wind blows, there is no concern lest it rot, but it is dishonorable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yishmael expound "Kol Po'al Hash-m la'Ma'anehu"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This forbids removing the Eimurim before flaying it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Noson):</span> We do not want hairs (wool) to stick to the Eimurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was Chachamim's response to R. Yishmael?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> They said, if we may save the case of a Sefer with the Sefer, all the more so we can flay Pesach entirely!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from a Sefer - there, we are lenient about mere Tiltul (moving something, which is forbidden only mid'Rabanan) - flaying is a Melachah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2A (Rav Ashi):</span> They argue about Tiltul (R. Yishmael forbids moving the Pesach after the Eimurim were removed, for the skin is still attached) and Melachah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If we may save the case of a Sefer with the Sefer, all the more so we can move the skin on account of the meat attached!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from a Sefer - there, the case is a Bosis for (serves) something permitted - here, the skin is a Bosis for something forbidden!</p>
