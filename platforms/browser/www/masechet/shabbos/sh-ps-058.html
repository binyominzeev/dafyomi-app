<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE <i>KAVLA</i> OF SLAVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 3:j, 57B - Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah discusses (forbids going out with) a signet [of slavery; normally, it is made of dried mud].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> But Shmuel permits a slave to go out with a signet on his neck, but not on his garment!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #1:</span> Shmuel discusses a signet made by the master - the slave fears to remove it [for the master would consider this rebellion], the Mishnah discusses a signet the slave made for himself (he might remove it and carry it in Reshus ha'Rabim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Shmuel discusses a signet made by the master, he should permit even if it is on his garment (he fears to remove it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned lest it break, and the slave will fear [lest his master assume that he intentionally broke it] and fold his garment onto his shoulder [to cover up its absence];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> If one walks in Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos with his garment folded onto his shoulder (this is not the way to wear it, it is a load), he is Chayav Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Shmuel (to R. Chinena bar Shila):</span> All Rabanan of the Reish Galusa's house may not go out with a coat with a signet, except for you. (Rashi - it is a sign of submissiveness to the Reish Galusa - if anyone else was not wearing it, the Reish Galusa would be upset; Rashba - the Reish Galusa levied a tax on important coats, the signet shows that the tax was paid; anyone except for R. Chinena would be afraid if it fell off.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A slave may go out with a signet on his neck, but not on his garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa #1):</span> A slave may go out with a signet on his neck, but not on his garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> A slave may not go out with a signet on his neck or on his garment; neither of them is Mekabel Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may go out with a bell on his garment, but not on his neck - both of these are Mekabel Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>An animal may not go out with a signet or bell on its neck or garment - neither of them is Mekabel Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Beraisa #1 discusses signets made by the master, and Beraisa #2 discusses signets the slave made for himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, both discuss signets made by the master - Beraisa #1 discusses signets of mud (if it breaks, the fragments are worthless), Beraisa #2 discusses metal signets:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> A slave may not go out with something that his master is insistent about [that it not get lost - perhaps it will break and the slave will carry the pieces];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He may go out with something that his master does not care about.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa #2):</span> ...Neither of them is Mekabel Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this if Beraisa #2 discusses metal signets - they are not Mekabel Tum'ah, but other metal Kelim are;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if Beraisa #2 discusses mud signets, why must it teach that they are Tehorim - all mud Kelim are Tehorim!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kelim made of stone, dung or dirt are not Mekabel Tum'ah, not mid'Oraisa nor mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Beraisa #2 discusses metal signets.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WEARING BELLS ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> He may go out with a bell on his garment, but not on his neck.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a bell on his neck forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Presumably, we are concerned that it will fall and he will carry it - the same applies to a bell on his garment!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is woven into the garment (surely, it will not fall):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Anything woven is permitted. (Above (57A), we said that because it is not tight, it need not be removed when immersing - but the Heter also shows that we are not concerned lest something fall from it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> An animal may not go out with a signet or bell on its neck or garment; neither of them is Mekabel Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A bell of an animal is Mekabel Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #3):</span> A bell of an animal is Mekabel Tum'ah, a doorbell is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">58b----------------------------------------58b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a doorbell was put on an animal, it is Tamei; if a bell of an animal was put on a door, even if it was nailed in, it is [still] Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is because a Kli is Mekabel Tum'ah through intent [to use it for something that is Mekabel Tum'ah], but it does not cease to Mekabel Tum'ah until an action is done [that hinders its original use].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A bell of an animal is Mekabel Tum'ah only if it has a clapper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is a Kli, it is Mekabel Tum'ah even without a clapper; if it is not a Kli, will a clapper make it a Kli?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes, a clapper makes it a Kli!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> What is the source that a metal Kli that makes noise is Mekabel Tum'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol <i>Davar</i> Asher Yavo ba'Esh..." - even Dibur (making noise) is included. (These words discuss Kashering vessels - since noise cannot affect Kashrus, we apply the Drashah to the subject of the continuation of this verse, i.e. Tum'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beraisa #2 cannot discuss a bell without a clapper!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Middle clause of Beraisa #2):</span> One may go out with a bell on his garment, but not on his neck - both of these are Mekabel Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A bell without a clapper is not Mekabel Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following bells are Mekabel Tum'ah only if they have a clapper - a bell for a grinder (noise is beneficial when grinding spices for Ketores), crib, cloth over a Sefer [Torah] or around a child's neck.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If the clapper was removed, it is still Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding a child, it is Mekabel Tum'ah only if it has a clapper - Beraisa #2 discusses an adult, a bell is a Tachshit (ornament) for him even without a clapper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the clapper was removed, it is still Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [Why is it Tamei -] what use is a bell without a clapper?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Because a commoner can put back the clapper [it is still considered connected].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava - Mishnah):</span> A bell and a clapper are connected.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this means, even if they are [physically] separated, it is as if they are connected (like Abaye taught)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> Scissors that come apart, and a [carpenter's] plane (the blade can be removed from the wood) are connected regarding [Kabalas] Tum'ah, but not regarding Haza'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they are considered connected, they should be connected even for Haza'ah; if they are not connected, they should not be connected for Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Mid'Oraisa, when they are being used, they are connected, at other times they are not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Chachamim decreed [to consider them connected for] Tum'ah when they are not being used on account of when they are being used, and they decreed [to consider them disconnected for] Haza'ah when they are being used on account of when they are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>(The decree to consider them connected for Tum'ah is when they are together [but not in use] - when they are separate, they are not considered connected at all!)</p>
