<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>COOKING WITH HOT ITEMS HEATED BY THE SUN OR BY FIRE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If one roasted an egg [near a kettle heated on a fire], what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> He is Chayav Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mar brei d'Ravina - Mishnah):</span> Any food that that was soaked [and fully cooked] in hot water [in a Kli Rishon (a pot that was on the fire)] before Shabbos, one may soak it in hot water on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Any food that that was not soaked in hot water before Shabbos, one may pour hot water over it (Rashbam - from a Kli Rishon; R. Tam - from a Kli Sheni (a Kli into which food was poured from a Kli Rishon)) on Shabbos, except for old salted fish or tuna fish, for rinsing them is their final preparation (and one is liable for this).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COOKING USING THE SUN ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not wrap an egg in garments; [R. Yosi permits].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The following Mishnah is like R. Yosi [who permits cooking via the sun], it is unlike Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may put a Tavshil in a pit [on Shabbos] to guard it; one may put good water [in a Kli] in bad water to cool it, one may put cold water in the sun to warm up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman):</span> No, all permit cooking <i>in</i> the sun; all forbid cooking through something heated by fire;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>They argue about cooking through something heated by the sun - Chachamim decree [lest one will come to cook in something heated by fire, R. Yosi does not decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not Matmin an egg [in sand or dust to roast].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi should also argue about this [and permit it]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> He forbids this, lest one will do Hatmanah in hot ashes [and make them flare up on Shabbos];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> He forbids this, lest one will uproot dirt [and make a hole].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> He forbids this, for one moves [Muktzeh] dirt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about loose dirt (this is also forbidden on account of hot ashes, but we are not concerned for making a hole (the remaining dirt caves in) or moving Muktzeh (one merely drops the egg, it sinks in itself)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> One may roast an egg on a hot roof (heated by the sun), but not in hot plaster (heated by a fire).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the decree is on account of hot ashes, we understand this - but if the decree is on account of moving dirt, this also applies on a roof!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Normally, a roof does not have [much] dirt (to warrant a decree).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A case occurred, people in Tiverya brought a pipe of cold water through a hot spring...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If [the previous law,] Hatmanah in sand or dirt is forbidden on account of hot ashes, we understand why Chachamim forbade the water, it also resembles Hatmanah - but if it is on account of moving dirt, why did they forbid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This episode does not support the previous law, rather, the Reisha, Chachamim argue with R. Yosi who permits wrapping an egg in garments;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They said, just like [previous] Chachamim forbade water heated through [the spring, which is heated by] the sun, one may not cook in anything heated by the sun;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, the spring is heated by fire, it passes over the opening to Gehinom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The episode in Tiverya teaches (Ramban - prompted Chachamim to decree) that Hatmanah in something that adds heat is forbidden, even from Erev Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> No - the Halachah follows the people of Tiverya [who permitted it]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> No - they [accepted Chachamim's words and] broke their pipe.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BATHING ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The people of Tiverya... [Chachamim said, on Shabbos, it is like water heated on Shabbos, one may not bathe in it or drink it.]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What bathing is discussed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It discusses bathing the whole body.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One may not bathing the whole body in water heated on Shabbos, but it is permitted in water heated from before Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa #1):</span> On Shabbos, one may wash his face, hands and feet in water heated from before Shabbos, but not his whole body.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It discusses washing one's face, hands and feet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> If it was on Yom Tov, it is like water heated on Yom Tov, one may not bathe in it, one may drink it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is our Stam Mishnah like Beis Shamai?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> One may not heat water [on Yom Tov] to wash his feet unless it is fitting to drink (Tosfos - unless he intends to drink some of it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Beis Hillel permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ika bar Chananyah):</span> Our Mishnah discusses showering (pouring water on) the whole body - it is like R. Shimon:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Meir):</span> [On Shabbos] one may not shower his entire body in hot or cold water;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon permits;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah forbids in hot water, he permits in cold water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Tana'im in this Beraisa argue about bathing in a Kli, but all permit bathing in the ground (it does not look like bathing in hot water).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The episode in Tiverya was in the ground, and Chachamim forbade!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Rav Chisda taught that they argue about bathing in the ground, but all forbid bathing in a Kli (onlookers will assume that the water was heated by fire on Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Did you hear this explicitly, or did you infer it from another teaching?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From which teaching could one infer it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan taught that the Halachah always follows the Machri'a (the mediating opinion), except for the case of a rag. (If a rag less than three by three [Tefachim] was designated for a lowly use, e.g. to plug up a bathhouse, R. Eliezer is Metamei whether he hung on a peg or left it in back of the door; R. Yehoshua is Metaher in both cases; R. Akiva is Metamei if he hung it on a peg, he is Metaher if he left it in back of the door.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Even though R. Eliezer is stringent, R. Yehoshua is lenient and R. Akiva is Machri'a, the Halachah does not follow R. Akiva:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Firstly, R. Akiva was a Talmidim of R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Also, R. Akiva later retracted and adopted R. Yehoshua's opinion in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference would it make if he inferred it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps R. Yochanan holds that the Halachah always follows the Machri'a in Mishnayos [with just the one exception], but the rule does not apply to Beraisos. (Even if he also said it regarding all Beraisos [that he knew], perhaps he never heard Beraisa #2!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> I heard it explicitly.</p>
