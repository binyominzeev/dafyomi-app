<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for nutshells, pomegranate peels, Istis and Pu'ah is enough to dye a small garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If one was Motzi soaked ingredients [for dye], the Shi'ur is to dye a sample the size of Ira (a small ball placed in the shuttle to hold the woof).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The Shi'ur in our Mishnah is bigger because people do not bother to soak the amount needed for a sample.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for urine...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The urine must be at most 40 days old (after that it not good for laundering or removing Dam Nidah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Niter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The niter is of Alexandria, not of Anfanterin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Boris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is sand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Boris and sand...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, Boris is sulfur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Chachamim added the following (they also have Kedushas Shemitah) - Chelbeitzin (ornithogalum), Le'inon (wormwood), Boris and aloe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shemitah does not apply to sulfur!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Shemitah applies to things that have roots [in the ground], and to nothing else.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, Boris is aloe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa listed Boris <i>and</i> aloe!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These are two kinds of aloe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kemulia.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is a type of grass which is dried and ground, and used for washing hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ashleg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel citing seafarers):</span> This is found in holes in pearls, it is extracted using iron prongs.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE CAN BE LIABLE FOR ANY AMOUNT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for the following is any amount (the reasons will be explained) - pepper, Itran (oil from a pine tree), fragrant spices, and kinds of metals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Shi'ur for the following is any amount that people store - stones or dirt of the Mizbe'ach, Mekek (worm-eaten) Seforim or Mekek of their covers;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, also the Shi'ur for idolatry is any amount - "Lo Yidbak b'Yadcha Me'umah Min ha'Cherem".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is a tiny pepper good for?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It covers up bad breath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any amount of Itran.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One is liable for any amount of something odorous (people fumigate Chulin or children with a bad smell to keep away Mazikim), good [fragrant] oil, purple wool (it can be smelled), or one young rose leaf (Rashi; Aruch - a rose colored cotton wick).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any amount of kinds of metals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a tiny amount good for?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Any amount of metal can be used to make a small Darban (end of a plow).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DONATIONS TO HEKDESH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Beraisa - Others):</span> If one said 'Alai (I vow to give to Hekdesh) iron', he must bring one Amah by one Amah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What use is there for this [in the Mikdash]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It is enough for Kalyah Orev (it prevents ravens from resting on the Heichal; Rashi - these are spikes, or an iron plate with a sharp edge pointing up; Aruch - it is a scarecrow).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa - Others):</span> He must bring enough for Kalyah Orev.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It is one Amah by one Amah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>[If one vowed to give] copper, he must bring the value of a silver Ma'ah (a sixth of a Dinar);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> He must bring the size of a small fork.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What use is there for this [in the Mikdash]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is used to trim the end of wicks and clean out the Neros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mekak of Seforim or their covers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Different worms have different names - Mekak eats Seforim, Tachech eats silk, Ila eats grapes, Peh eats figs, Hah eats pomegranates - it is dangerous to eat any of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>A Talmid was eating figs in front of R. Yochanan; he felt something prick his throat, and cried out 'There are thorns in these figs!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Peh killed this Talmid.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SHI'URIM OF SEEDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Motzi a peddler's box (it has many compartments), even though there are many species in it, he brings only one Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One is liable for [Hotza'ah of] less than k'Grogeres of garden seeds;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira is Mechayev for five seeds.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">90b----------------------------------------90b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One is liable for two seeds of cucumbers, gourds, or Mitzri beans.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One is liable for a live Tahor grasshopper of any size; if it is dead, the Shi'ur is k'Grogeres.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>One is liable for Tzipores Keramim (this will be defined) of any size, dead or alive, for people save it for cures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yehudah says, even one who is Motzi a live Tamei grasshopper is liable, for people save it for children to play with.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction (Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> The Shi'ur for manure or fine sand is enough to fertilize a stalk of cabbage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, it is enough to fertilize a leek stalk. (This shows that even what comes from one seed is important!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> A seed that already grew is different, for people do not bother to take out a single seed to plant.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Cucumber seeds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was Motzi date pits to plant, the Shi'ur is two; if he was Motzi them to eat, the Shi'ur is enough to fill a pig's mouth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If he was Motzi them for fuel, the Shi'ur is enough to cook a light egg; if he was Motzi them for [markers for] calculating, the Shi'ur is two;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Others say, the Shi'ur [for calculating] is five.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE <i>SHI'UR HOTZA'AH</i> FOR SMALL ITEMS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was Motzi two hairs from the tail of a horse or cow, he is liable, for people use these for nets to trap birds;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Shi'ur for hard hairs over a pig's spine is one, the Shi'ur for peeled palm leaves is two; the Shi'ur for fibers (that grow around date trees) is one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is liable for Tzipores Keramim of any size, dead or alive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It is Palya Bi'ari (a Tahor grasshopper).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> It is found in date trees surrounded by only one ring of shoots; it is used to open the heart [to understand].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One eats the right half and puts the left half in a reed, seals it with 60 (i.e. many) seals, and hangs it on his left arm.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A way to remember this - "Lev Chacham li'Mino v'Lev Kesil li'Smolo".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>After he becomes sufficiently wise, and learned enough, he may eat the left half;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he will not (rather, he will discard it), he will forget his learning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Even one who is Motzi a live Tamei grasshopper is liable, for people save it for children to play with.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The first Tana holds that people do not save it for children to play with.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They are afraid that the child will eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, they should also be concerned about Tahor grasshoppers!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Kahana was in front of Rav, he put a Tahor grasshopper in front of his mouth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> Remove it, lest people will say that you ate it and transgressed Bal Teshaktzu (doing something disgusting)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They are afraid that it will die and then the child will eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Yehudah is not concerned for this - if it died, a child would eulogize it [and not eat it].</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'MATZNI'A</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>ONE WHO IS <i>MATZNI'A</i> IS LIABLE FOR <i>HOTZA'AH</i> OF ANY AMOUNT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> if one was Matzni'a (stored away) for planting, a sample or for a cure and was Motzi on Shabbos, he is liable for any amount;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Anyone else is not liable unless if he was Motzi a Shi'ur;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he (the Matzni'a who was Motzi) later decided not to plant it and took it back into his house, he is liable [for Hachnasah to Reshus ha'Yachid] only for a Shi'ur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does it say that he was Matzni'a - it should say that one who was Motzi for planting, a sample or a cure is liable for any amount (since it is important for him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The case is, he was Matzni'a and later forgot why he was Matzni'a, and was Motzi Stam (without intent):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that he nullified his original intent - the Mishnah teaches, this is not so, one always acts according to his original intent.</p>
