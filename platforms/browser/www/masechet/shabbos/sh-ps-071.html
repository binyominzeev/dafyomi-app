<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>But if he first found out about his latter reaping (Shigegas Melachah), and separated a Korban for it, it will Gorer the first reaping, and the first reaping will Gorer the first grinding (both were in the same Shigegas Shabbos), but the latter grinding will need its own Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Also the first grinding is Gorer the latter grinding - all grinding is one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava argues with the principle of Greirah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one ate two k'Zeisim of Chelev in one Helam, and found out about one of them, and ate a third k'Zayis in the same Helam with (i.e. before finding out about) the second [and later finding out about the last two):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he brought a Korban [and said that it is] for the first, it atones for the first two, but not for the third.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he brought a Korban for the third, it atones for the last two, but not for the first.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If he brought a Korban for the second, it atones for all three.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> In any case, the Korban atones for all three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once Rava heard about Greirah from Abaye, he agreed to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, grinding should also Gorer grinding [when he separated a Korban for the latter reaping]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He agreed to Greirah (the latter reaping is Gorer the first reaping), but not Greirah of Greirah (the first grinding only gets atonement through Greirah, it cannot Gorer something else).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Abaye and Rava had no doubt that a Korban for Zadon Shabbos and Shigegas Melachos also atones for Zadon Melachos and Shigegas Shabbos - R. Zeira was unsure about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If one reaped [or grinded] half a k'Zayis amidst Zadon Melachos and Shigegas Shabbos, and later reaped [or grinded] half a k'Zayis amidst Zadon Shabbos and Shigegas Melachos, do they join [together to obligate a Korban]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Asi):</span> They require separate Chata'os (a Korban for Zadon Shabbos and Shigegas Melachos does not atone for Zadon Melachos and Shigegas Shabbos), [therefore] they do not join.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> It is not true that whenever separate Chata'os are required, they do not join!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one ate Chelev twice in one Helam, he is liable only once;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he ate Chelev, blood, Pigul, and Nosar in one Helam, he is liable for each one - this is a stringency of different Minim (Isurim) over [multiple transgressions of] one Min.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A stringency of one Min over different Minim - if one ate half a k'Zayis, and then another half a k'Zayis in one Helam:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they were both the same Min, he is liable; if they were different Minim, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously, he is liable regarding one Min!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> The case is, he ate it in two plates (Rashi - cooked two different ways) - it is like R. Yehoshua who says that plates Mechalek;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One might have thought that he says this both to be lenient and to be stringent - we learn that, this is not so, he says this only to be stringent (i.e. only when being Mechalek will obligate more Korbanos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Even though separate Chata'os are required, they join!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Asi):</span> You ask because you assume that Reish Lakish discusses the Reisha - we learn that he discusses the Seifa, it is not difficult;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (regarding the Seifa):</span> Obviously, he is exempt regarding two Minim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> Really, it is one Min - it is called two Minim because it was eaten in two plates;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is like R. Yehoshua who says that plates Mechalek - we learn that he says this both to be lenient and to be stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Seifa discusses one Min and two plates, the Reisha must discuss one Min and one plate - this is obvious (that in such a case he is Chayav)!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">71b----------------------------------------71b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> The case is, he found out in between;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah is like R. Gamliel, who says that Yedi'ah (finding out) after eating half a Shi'ur has no effect (if he eats another half-Shi'ur b'Shogeg, they join).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES HAFRASHAH OR KAPARAH MAKE CHILUK CHATA'OS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one ate two k'Zeisim of Chelev in one Helam, and found out about one of them, and later found out about the other, he brings two Chata'os;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He is liable only one Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yochanan learns from "Al Chataso v'Hevi" (one must bring for each transgression);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Reish Lakish learns from "<i>Me</i>'Chataso v'Nislach Lo" (even if he brought a Korban for part of his Chet, it atones for all of it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Reish Lakish explain "Al Chataso v'Hevi"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches about [finding out about another transgression] after Kaparah (then, another Korban is required).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yochanan explain "Me'Chataso v'Nislach Lo"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he ate one and a half k'Zeisim, he found out about a k'Zayis, then ate another half k'Zayis in the same Helam with the remaining half k'Zayis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that the half-k'Zeisim join - the verse teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Do they argue about when he found out before Hafrashah (being Makdish a Chatas) - R. Yochanan holds that Yedi'os Mechalek, Reish Lakish holds that Hafrashos Mechalek;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reish Lakish agrees that if he found out after Hafrashah he brings two Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do they argue about when he found out after Hafrashah - R. Yochanan holds that Hafrashos Mechalek, Reish Lakish holds that Kaparos Mechalek?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yochanan agrees that if he found out before Hafrashah he brings one Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Or, do they argue in both cases, whether he found out before or after Hafrashah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Presumably, they argue in both cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reish Lakish agreed that if he found out after Hafrashah he brings two Korbanos, he could have established "Al Chataso v'Hevi" in this case, instead of after Kaparah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If R. Yochanan agreed that if he found out before Hafrashah he brings one Korban, he could have established "Me'Chataso v'Nislach Lo" in this case, instead of a case of one and a half k'Zeisim [followed by another half k'Zayis]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the above answers for how each of them would explain the other's verse were given because the Gemara was unsure in which case they argue (therefore it covered all possibilities):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If you will say that they argue before Hafrashah, R. Yochanan can establish "Me'Chataso v'Nislach Lo" in a case of one and a half k'Zeisim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If you will say that they argue after Hafrashah, Reish Lakish can establish "Al Chataso v'Hevi" to discuss after Kaparah.</p>
