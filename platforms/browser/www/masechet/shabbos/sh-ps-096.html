<p class="dedicationbox">SHABBOS 96 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the thirteenth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>SHI'URIM</i> OF <i>HOTZA'AH</i> FOR EARTHENWARE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi - Beraisa):</span> The smallest hole that disqualifies an [intact] Kli Shares is Kones Mashkeh - the Shi'ur of Motzi Mashkeh pertains only to shards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does a hole that is Motzi Mashkeh disqualify a shard?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Nachman):</span> [Shards are used only to catch what drips from a Kli] - people will not use a shard if they will need another shard to catch what drips from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> R. Yosi b'Rebbi Avin and R. Yosi bar Zavda argued [about the Shi'ur to prevent Hechsher of seeds] - one says that it is k'Motzi Rimon, the other says that it is enough for a small root to pass through;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A way to remember the opinions - 'Whether one does a lot or a little...' (the two Shi'urim are the biggest and smallest of Rava's [three biggest] Shi'urim; surely, the Shi'urim of Motzi Mashkeh and Kones Mashkeh have no connection to seeds).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chinena bar Kahana citing R. Eliezer):</span> The Shi'ur for [Taharas] Klei Cheres is k'Motzi Zeisim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Kashisha brei d'Rabah citing R. Eliezer):</span> ...If they have such a hole they are like Kelim of manure, rocks or dirt, which do not Mekabel Tum'ah mid'Oraisa nor mid'Rabanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If it has a Tzamid Pasil, it is not Mekabel Tum'ah unless most of it is open.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'ZOREK</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE TOLDOS OF HOTZA'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one threw from Reshus ha'Yachid to Reshus ha'Rabim or vice-versa, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Akiva says, if he threw from Reshus ha'Yachid to Reshus ha'Yachid and Reshus ha'Rabim is in the middle, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If two ledges jut out from houses on opposite sides of Reshus ha'Rabim and he was Moshit (passed an object) or threw from one to the other, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If both ledges were on the same side, one is in front (further along in Reshus ha'Rabim) of the other, if he was Moshit from one to the other, he is liable, if he threw he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This was the Avodah of the Leviyim - there were two wagons, one in front of the other, they would pass Kerashim (boards of the Mishkan) from one to the other, they would not throw them [because they were very heavy].</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">96b----------------------------------------96b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Throwing is a Toladah of Hotza'ah - where does the Torah forbid Hotza'ah? (Tosfos - it is known that Hotza'ah is a subordinate Melachah, if there was not a verse for it, it would not be considered an Av.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> "...Va'Ya'aviru Kol ba'Machaneh" - Moshe was in Machaneh Levi, a Reshus ha'Rabim, and he told Yisrael not to take out [more donations for the Mishkan] from Reshus ha'Yachid (their tents) to Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that this was on Shabbos, and he stopped them from bringing because it is a Melachah? Perhaps it was on a weekday, he told them that no more donations were needed - "Veha'Melachah Haysah Dayam..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah 'Ha'avarah-Ha'avarah' from Yom Kipur:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says there "V'Ha'avarta Shofar Teru'ah" - just as there it refers to a day (Yom Kipur) when Melachah is forbidden, also Ha'avarah written regarding donations for the Mishkan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This shows that Hotza'ah is forbidden - what is the source for Hachnasah (from Reshus ha'Rabim to Reshus ha'Yachid)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Logic dictates, there is no difference between taking out and talking in - however, Hotza'ah is an Av, Hachnasah is a Toladah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One is liable for both of them - why is one called an Av and the other a Toladah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The difference is, if two [different] Avos or two Toldos [of different Avos] were done together [in one Helam of Zadon Shabbos and Shigegas Melachos], he is liable for each;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did an Av and its Toladah, he is liable only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Eliezer, who is Mechayev two Chata'os for an Av and its Toladah, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Melachos that were in the Mishkan are important, they (some texts - important Melachos in the Mishkan) are called Avos, those that were not (some texts - important) in the Mishkan are Toldos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> [Regarding transferring Reshuyos,] what is written (Hotza'ah) is an Av, what is not written (e.g. Hachnasah) is a Toladah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SOURCE FOR THE <i>MELACHAH</i> OF THROWING ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one threw something four Amos [in Reshus ha'Rabim] at a wall [and it stuck to it]:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If this was above 10 Tefachim it is as if he threw in the air [and it never landed, he is exempt];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If this was below 10 Tefachim, it is as if he threw on the ground - one who throws four Amos on the ground is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to Mechayev one who throws four Amos on the ground?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yoshiyah):</span> People who wove curtains would throw needles to each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Weavers do not use needles!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> People who sewed curtains (Rashi - they sewed designs; Rashash - they sewed curtains together, or repaired torn curtains) would throw needles to each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the sewers were right next to each other (there was no need to throw)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They would not do so, lest they prick each other with the needles [when pulling the thread tight].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps they were within four Amos of each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> People who wove curtains throw the shuttle (holding the woof) across (between the warp threads).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even after throwing it, it is Agud b'Yado (he is connected to it, he holds onto the woof)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The last time he throws it, he lets go.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He throws it in a Makom Patur (between the warp threads)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, people who wove curtains throw [spare] shuttles to people [weaving a different curtain] who ask to borrow it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they were right next to each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They would not do so, lest they hit each other when pulling the warp tight at the end of the curtain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Perhaps they were staggered (they were not in line with each other - even though they were close, they would not hit each other)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> They did not borrow from each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ish Ish mi'Melachto Asher Hemah Osim" - everyone had his own Kelim, he did not use another's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection #3:</span> We still have no source to Mechayev Moshit four Amos in Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> A tradition from Moshe from Sinai teaches all the Chiyuvim for four Amos in Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE MEKOSHESH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The [man executed for] Mekoshesh (gathering wood, Bamidbar 15:32) carried four Amos in Reshus ha'Rabim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He detached wood [from trees].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha b'Rebbi Yakov):</span> He made piles.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make why he was killed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need to know on account of Rav's teaching:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> I found a hidden scroll, in which Isi ben Yehudah says that there are 39 Melachos, a person [who does all of them] is liable only once. (Even before the Oral Torah was written, one was permitted to write Halachos to help <i>himself</i> remember - Rambam, introduction to Mishnah Torah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Mishnah):</span> There are 39 Avos Melachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need to know the number?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> This teaches that is one did all of them in one Helam, he is liable for each. (Surely, Isi agrees with this!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, there is one for which he is not Chayav [Misah - but Isi agrees that he is Chayav Chatas for all 39 - Tosfos 6B].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rav Yehudah is sure that one is Chayav [Misah] for carrying in Reshus ha'Rabim, the Beraisa is sure that one is Chayav for detaching, Rav Acha is sure that one is Chayav for making piles.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> Tzelafchad was the Mekoshesh - it says "Va'Yihyu Venei Yisrael <i>ba'Midbar</i> va'Yimtze'u Ish...", and it says "Avinu Mes <i>ba'Midbar</i>" - just like the latter refers to Tzelafchad, also the former.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah ben Beseira:</span> In any case, you should not say this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If you are right, the Torah covered up his identity, and you reveal it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If you are wrong, you malign a Tzadik!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Akiva learns from a Gezerah Shavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he had no tradition for such a Gezerah Shavah.</p>
