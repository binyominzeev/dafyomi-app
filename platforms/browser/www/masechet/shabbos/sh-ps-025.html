<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE MAY BENEFIT FROM <i>TERUMAH</i> THAT IS <i>TEMEI'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is forbidden on Yom Tov, but on Chol one may burn Shemen Sereifah [and benefit from this]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Just like it is a Mitzvah to burn Tamei Kodshim, it is a Mitzvah to burn Tamei Terumah - the Torah permitted to benefit at the time of burning [Terumah].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where does the Torah permit this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from Rav Nachman:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> "...Mishmeres Terumosai" - the verse discusses two Terumos, Tahor and Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It says "Lecha" - they are yours (the Kohen's - Tamei Terumah may not be eaten, but) you may burn it and cook over the fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from R. Avahu:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> "V'Lo Vi'arti Mimenu b'Tamei" - you may not consume Ma'aser b'Tum'ah (eat it when it or you are Tamei, or burn it if it is Tamei), but you may burn [and benefit from] Tamei Terumah oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we say, you may not burn Tamei Ma'aser, but you may burn [and benefit from] Tamei Kodesh oil?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Kal v'Chomer refutes this:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Ma'aser is lenient, yet it may not be burned in Tumah - Kodesh is stringent, all the more so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, the same applies to Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mimenu" excludes [and permits Terumah].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Mimenu" excludes Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is unreasonable, for Kodesh has many stringencies:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It can become Pigul (if a Korban was offered with intent to eat or offer it after the allotted time), or Nosar, it is called Korban, Me'ilah applies to it, a Tamei [person] who eats it is Chayav Kares, it is forbidden to an Onen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rather, we should forbid Terumah, since it has these stringencies:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Tamei who eats it is Chayav Misah bi'Dei Shamayim, a Zar (non-Kohen) who eats it b'Shogeg must add a fifth when paying for what he ate, it cannot be redeemed, it is forbidden to a Zar.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Kodesh has more stringencies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Kares is more stringent than Misah bi'Dei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> "Titen Lo" (give [Tahor] Terumah which the Kohen himself can eat), do not give [Tamei Terumah, which will be fuel] for his fire;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that the Kohen may use it for [fuel] for his fire.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHY TAR MAY NOT BE USED FOR THE SHABBOS LIGHTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> One may not light [with tar, it is dishonorable to Shabbos].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It smells bad - we decree, lest he will leave the room [and be in dark on Shabbos].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What is wrong if he leaves?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> I hold that Ner Shabbos is obligatory:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Ner Shabbos is obligatory; washing the hands and feet in hot water on Shabbos night is Reshus (optional).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> I say that washing is a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Mitzvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah taught, on Shabbos night they would bring to <i>R.</i> Yehudah a basin of hot water, he would wash his face, hands and feet, cloak himself and sit in decorated linen garments [with Tzitzis, including woolen Techeiles], he resembled an angel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>His Talmidim hid the corners of their garments [of linen, they did not have Tzitzis].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> I taught to you - Beis Shamai exempt linen garments from Tzitzis and Beis Hillel obligate, and the Halachah follows Beis Hillel! (Tosfos - Beis Shamai decree, lest one put Techeiles on a night garment, which is exempt from Tzitzis, he transgresses Sha'atnez; Rashi - Beis Shamai hold that mid'Oraisa, the Mitzvah of Tzitzis does not override Sha'atnez).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>His Talmidim held that Chachamim decreed to exempt linen garments, on account of a night garment [even according to Beis Hillel].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Va'Tiznach mi'Shalom Nafshi (I had no Shalom)"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> This is [not having] Ner Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Nashisi Tovah (I forgot what is good)"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> This is a bathhouse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> This is washing hands and feet in hot water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> This is a nice bed and nice Kelim on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Aba):</span> This is a spread bed and a wife adorned (Rashba - in her deeds) for a Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A wealthy person is one who enjoys his wealth (Maharsha; Rashi - he is happy with what he has);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Tarfon says, it is one who as 100 vineyards, 100 field and 100 slaves to work them. (Maharsha - one who gathers wealth to be called Ashir will feel that he needs all this - and still, he will not be satisfied with it);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Akiva says, it is one who has a wife whose deeds are nice;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Yosi says, it is one who has a Beis ha'Kisei near his table</p>
