<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>SAFEK</i> DOES NOT OVERRIDE SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not Mechalel Shabbos for a Safek or Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "[Uva'Yom ha'Shmini Yimol Besar] Arlaso" - a Vadai overrides Shabbos, a Safek does not (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Vadai [male] overrides Shabbos, Androginus does not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, Androginus overrides Shabbos, he is Chayav Kares (if he grows up and does not circumcise himself);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Vadai [eight day old] overrides Shabbos, a baby born Bein ha'Shemashos does not (we do not know which is his eighth day);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A Vadai overrides Shabbos, a baby born Mahul (without foreskin) does not:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Beis Shamai obligate Hatafas Dam Bris (drawing a drop of blood from the end of the Ever, but this does not override Shabbos);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Beis Hillel exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, all require Hatafas Dam Bris from a baby born Mahul, in case there is there is foreskin there that is covered;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They argue about one who converted after he was already circumcised - Beis Shamai require Hatafas Dam Bris, Beis Hillel do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says 'A Safek does not override Shabbos' - what does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> We are Mechalel Shabbos for a baby born after seven months of pregnancy, not for an eight month baby (if its hair and nails are not properly developed, it is a Nefel);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we are unsure if a baby is seven or eight months, we do not Mechalel Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>An eighth month baby [even if he appears to be alive, he is dead, he] is [Muktzeh] like a stone; one may not move him on Shabbos. However, his mother may bend over to let him nurse, on account of danger (if she is too full of milk; Rashi in Yevamos - also for danger to him).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HATAFAS DAM BRIS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Halachah follows the first Tana [regarding Hatafas Dam Bris];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Ada bar Ahavah had a son born Mahul - he requested 13 Mohalim [to do Hatafas Dam Bris on Shabbos - all refused, so] he did so himself, and accidentally castrated him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ada:</span> I deserved to be punished for transgressing Rav's opinion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> You also transgressed Shmuel's opinion!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel holds that Hatafas Dam Bris is done on a weekday, but not on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Ada holds that Shmuel obligates Hatafas Dam Bris even on Shabbos, for there is definitely covered foreskin:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> [Shmuel holds that] there <i>might</i> be covered foreskin (therefore, it does not override Shabbos);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> [He holds that] there is definitely covered foreskin (therefore, it overrides Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Yosef, for himself - Beraisa - R. Eliezer ha'Kapar):</span> Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel do not argue about a baby born Mahul, all require Hatafas Dam Bris;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about whether or not it overrides Shabbos - Beis Shamai say that it does, Beis Hillel say that it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The first Tana [that R. Eliezer responds to; Tosfos - it is R. Shimon ben Elazar] holds that they do not argue about this, i.e. all agree that it overrides Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps the first Tana holds that all agree that it does not override Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is unreasonable, for then R. Eliezer comes to teach about Beis Shamai, that they say it overrides Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps he [primarily] comes to teach what Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree about (i.e. even Beis Hillel require Hatafas Dam Bris, unlike the first Tana)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHICH BABIES ARE CIRCUMCISED BEFORE THE EIGHTH DAY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> Whenever the mother has Tum'as Yoledes, the baby is circumcised on the eighth day; whenever there is no Tum'as Leidah, he is not circumcised on day eight - "...V'Yoldah Zachar v'Tom'ah... uva'Yom ha'Shmini Yimol".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> The Halachah before the Torah was given disproves this - there was no Tum'as Leidah, yet Milah was on day eight!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Asi):</span> My rule applies from after Matan Torah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">135b----------------------------------------135b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is unlike Rav Huna and R. Chiya bar Aba:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna or R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> We Mechalel Shabbos for [circumcision of] Yotzei Dofen (one born through Caesarian section) and a baby with two foreskins [one on top of the other; Me'iri - this cannot be, surely both must be cut, all would agree that we Mechalel Shabbos for this - rather, he has an extra Ever];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Huna and R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> We do not Mechalel Shabbos for them. (We do not Mechalel for a baby with two foreskins, perhaps Milah of only one of them overrides Shabbos, and we do not know which!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>[Regarding Yotzei Dofen] they argue only about Chilul Shabbos, but all agree that he is circumcised on day eight [even though there is no Tum'as Leidah]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, their argument is about this - the latter opinion says that it does not override Shabbos because he is not circumcised on day eight!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Tana'im argue as R. Asi and Abaye argue (<i>R.</i> Chama is a Tana in the coming Beraisa):</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (It says "U'Ven Shemonas Yomim Yimol <i>Lachem</i>" - a slave is circumcised on day eight only if his master also had a full Kinyan (ha'Guf) in the mother.) Sometimes Yelid Bayis (a baby born to a Shifchah Kena'anis of a Yisrael) is circumcised on day one, sometimes he is circumcised on day eight; sometimes Miknas Kesef (a Nochri bought by a Yisrael to be an Eved Kena'ani) is circumcised on day one, sometimes he is circumcised on day eight.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one bought a pregnant Shifchah and she gave birth afterwards, this is Miknas Kesef that is circumcised on day eight;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one bought a Shifchah with her baby, this is Miknas Kesef that is circumcised on day one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If one bought a Shifchah and she became pregnant afterwards, her son is Yelid Bayis that is circumcised on day eight;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Chama says, if she gave birth and then immersed [l'Shem Shifchus], her son is Yelid Bayis that is circumcised on day one; if she gave birth after immersing, her son is Yelid Bayis that is circumcised on day eight;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The first Tana holds that even if she gave birth first, and is not Teme'ah Leidah, he is circumcised on day eight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Indeed, according to R. Chama, Yelid Bayis is sometimes circumcised on day one, sometimes on day eight, and likewise regarding Miknas Kesef;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa explained when Yelid Bayis is circumcised on day one and when on day eight (she gave birth before or after immersing, respectively);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one bought a pregnant Shifchah, and she immersed and gave birth afterwards, this is Miknas Kesef circumcised on day eight;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Reuven bought a pregnant Shifchah and Shimon bought her fetus, even if she gave birth after immersing, this is Miknas Kesef circumcised on day one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>But according to the first Tana, we find three of these - how do we find Yelid Bayis circumcised on day one?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmiyah):</span> The case is, Reuven bought a Shifchah [solely] for her fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that Kinyan Peiros (rights of usage) is unlike Kinyan ha'Guf;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But according to the opinion that Kinyan Peiros is like Kinyan ha'Guf, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> The case is, he bought a Shifchah without intent to immerse her (the Mitzvos of slaves do not apply to her).</p>
