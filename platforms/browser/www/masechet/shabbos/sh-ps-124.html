<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>STRINGENCIES OF MOVING <i>KELIM</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The following Mishnayos were all taught before other Kelim were permitted - Kanim, poles, Glustera and [the Beraisa about] Meduchah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Kanim - (Mishnah):</span> Arranging the small poles (that held up Lechem ha'Panim) or removing them does not override Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Poles - (Mishnah):</span> There were smooth thin poles in the Azarah - [when Erev Pesach is on a weekday] two people hold up a pole on their shoulders, the Pesach is flayed hanging on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Eliezer says, when it is on Shabbos, each man puts one hand on his friend's shoulder, the Pesach is flayed hanging from their hands;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Glustera - (Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> If a bolt (for locking a door) has a thick end (fitting to crush garlic), one may [remove and] drag it from one door to [hang on] another (it may not be moved normally, even though it is Kli she'Melachto l'Heter);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Tarfon says, it is like all Kelim, it may be moved in the Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Meduchah is the above Beraisa (123B, that Abaye asked from).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Perhaps all of these were after Kelim were permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(New Lechem ha'Panim is placed on the Shulchan on Shabbos day, the old bread is removed.) Kanim hold up and separate the loaves so they will not get moldy - it is possible to remove poles from the old bread before Shabbos and arrange the new bread on them on Motzei Shabbos, we are not concerned for mold in a short time (the old loaves are without poles for less than a day, and also the new bread. Rashba - since it is possible without them, it is as if there is no need for them; <i>Rabah</i> makes this objection, he forbids moving from the sun to the shade.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We do not use poles to hold up Korban Pesach on Shabbos, because it is possible to do like R. Eliezer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yanai explained that the Mishnah of Glustera discusses a Chatzer without an Eiruv;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yehoshua holds that within the doorway (from which the bolt was taken) resembles inside [the house], therefore one may not carry it normally in the Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Tarfon holds that within the doorway is like outside, one may not take it out to the Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Beraisa of Meduchah is like R. Nechemyah (in the coming Mishnah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Kelim may be moved for a need or without a need;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Nechemyah says they may be moved only for a need.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What are 'for a need' and 'without a need'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> 'For a need' is using Kli she'Melachto l'Heter; 'without a need' is moving Kli she'Melachto l'Heter for its place, or moving Kli she'Melachto l'Isur to use it, but not for its place;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Nechemyah permits even Kli she'Melachto l'Heter only to use it, but not for its place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> You cannot call for its place 'without a need'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> 'For a need' is Kli she'Melachto l'Heter for its use or place; 'without a need' is from the sun to the shade, or Kli she'Melachto l'Isur for its use or place, but not from the sun to the shade;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Nechemyah says that even Kli she'Melachto l'Heter may be moved only for its use or place, but not from the sun to the shade.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Safra, Rav Acha and Rav Huna):</span> According to Rabah, according to R. Nechemyah, how may we move bowls [after finishing the food inside]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Safra):</span> One may move it just like Geraf Shel Re'i (because it bothers him there).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Abaye asked the same question to Rabah, he cited Rav Safra's answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If there is garlic in a Meduchah, it may be moved; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> That refers to moving it from the sun to the shade.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> Both [Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel] agree that if one cut meat on it (an Eli), it may not be moved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Also that refers to moving it from the sun to the shade.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> [On Yom Tov] one may not support a bowl or door with a piece of wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A piece of wood is Melachto l'Heter on Yom Tov (it may be burned) - this teaches that Kli she'Melachto l'Heter may not be moved for its use or place!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, since it is Melachto l'Isur on Shabbos, we decree to forbid on Yom Tov like on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even on Shabbos it should be permitted - Melachto l'Isur is permitted for the sake of its use or place!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only if it is a Kli - this is not a Kli.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PROHIBITING AN ACT ON YOM TOV ON ACCOUNT OF SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not decree [Yom Tov on account of Shabbos]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> One may lower produce [on the roof to avoid the rain] through a skylight on Yom Tov, but not on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> We [usually] do decree [Yom Tov on account of Shabbos]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2):</span> The only difference between [what is permitted and forbidden on] Yom Tov and Shabbos is preparation of food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> Mishnah #1 is R. Yehoshua [who permits toil on Yom Tov to save one's money]; Mishnah #2 is R. Eliezer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If an animal and its child fell into a pit [on Yom Tov], he brings one animal up with intent to slaughter it today, and brings food down to sustain the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, he brings one animal up with intent to slaughter it today, then decides that he would rather slaughter the other today, permitting him to bring it up - then he may slaughter either.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Eliezer does not permit toil there because it is possible to feed the animal in the pit [there will not be a loss], but he would permit lowering produce [he has no other way to save it];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps R. Yehoshua permits only when there is a scheme [it looks like he toils in order to slaughter it], but he would forbid where there is no way to scheme!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Beis Shamai decree Yom Tov on account of Shabbos, Beis Hillel do not:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">124b----------------------------------------124b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> One may not Motzi a child, Lulav or Sefer Torah to Reshus ha'Rabim [on Yom Tov];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Granted, Beis Shamai forbid Hotza'ah [on Yom Tov on account of Shabbos] - this is no source that they do so regarding Tiltul (moving Muktzeh)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tiltul was forbidden on account of Hotza'ah - if people can move, they will be Motzi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav holds like Rava:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Moving a hoe so it will not be stolen is Tiltul without a need, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He forbids moving so it will not be stolen - but for its use or place is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Kahana visited Rav's house, and Rav said 'Bring a beam for him to sit on';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav said 'to sit on' to teach that Kli she'Melachto l'Isur is permitted only for use, not for its place</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, he said 'Move the beam [so he can sit in its place]'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He moved it from a bad place to a good place (had Rav not said 'to sit on', one might have thought that it is permitted from sun to shade).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Mari bar Rachel had felt pillows in the sun; he asked Rava if he may move them; Rava permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Mari:</span> I have others!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> These are useful in case guests will come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Mari:</span> I have others in case guests will come!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> This shows that you hold like Rabah [who forbids from sun to shade] - it is permitted for anyone else, it is forbidden for you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba citing Rav):</span> One may move a cloth brush on Shabbos, but not a broom made from a date branch;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Even a date broom is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about 'for its use and place'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav would not forbid - he holds like Rava!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about from sun to shade.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Elazar would not permit this regarding a date branch!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, they argue about from sun to shade - it should say, also R. Elazar said so (cloth is permitted, a branch is forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MOVING BROKEN <i>KELIM</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kli may be moved, its fragments may be moved with it, on condition that they have a use, e.g. pieces of a kneading trough to cover a barrel, or pieces of glass to cover a flask;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, the fragments may be moved only if they have a use like the original function of the Kli, e.g. pieces of a trough to pour thick porridge into it, or pieces of glass to pour oil into them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> They argue about when it broke before Shabbos - R. Yehudah requires a use like the original Kli, Chachamim accept any use;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it broke on Shabbos, all permit, for at the start of Shabbos the fragments were Muchanim (prepared for use) as part of the Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Zutrai - Beraisa):</span> One may burn Kelim [on Yom Tov], but not broken Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When did the Kelim break?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They broke before Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They are like pieces of wood, surely they may be burned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They broke on Yom Tov (and nevertheless, one may not burn them)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Rav Yehudah taught that they argue about when it broke on Shabbos - Chachamim say that the fragments were Muchanim, R. Yehudah says that they are Nolad (unless they can be used like the original Kli);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it broke before Shabbos, all permit, for the fragments were Muchanim for use before Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One may burn Kelim, but not broken Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> Just like one may burn Kelim, he may burn broken Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3):</span> One may not burn Kelim or broken Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Beraisa #1 is R. Yehudah [who forbids Muktzeh and Nolad - Kelim are not Muktzeh, but broken Kelim are Nolad], Beraisa #2 is R. Shimon [who permits Muktzeh and Nolad], Beraisa #3 is R. Nechemyah [who only permits Kelim for their intended purpose].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> One may move bricks left over from building, for one can sit on them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he piled them up, this shows that he plans to use them for [another] building (they are forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> One may move a small piece of earthenware in a Chatzer, but not in a Karmelis;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman himself):</span> It is permitted even in a Karmelis, but not in a Reshus ha'Rabim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is permitted even in a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>This is like Rava taught elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava was walking in a Reshus ha'Rabim of Mechuza; his shoes got muddy, so he took a piece of Cheres and cleaned them; Rabanan shouted to protest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Not only do they not know what is permitted and what is forbidden, they even teach [their mistakes] to others!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it was in a Chatzer it would be fitting to cover a Kli - here also it is fitting for me!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a barrel was crushed, the cork and the fragments may be moved on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a barrel was crushed, the cork and the fragments may be moved on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>One may not cut off protrusions from fragments to make them fitting to cover Kelim or support the legs of a bed (this is Makeh b'Patish);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>If he threw the cork to the wasteheap, it is forbidden [it is no longer a Kli].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> If one threw his cloak to the wasteheap, is it forbidden?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Papa):</span> Rather, if he threw the cork to the wasteheap before Shabbos, it is forbidden.</p>
