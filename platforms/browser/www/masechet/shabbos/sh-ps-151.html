<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FOR WHAT MAY ONE <i>MACHSHICH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Aba Sha'ul):</span> The general rule is [if one may discuss doing something, he may Machshich for it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding which part of the Mishnah does he say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He says this about the Reisha (one may not Machshich to hire workers or bring produce).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he should have said [his rule regarding Isur,] 'If one may <i>not</i> discuss doing something, he may not Machshich for it'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He says this about the Seifa, one may Machshich to guard produce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, instead of saying 'If one may discuss doing something, he may Machshich for it', he should [begin with the law already taught, and learn to something new, i.e.] say 'If one may Machshich for something, he may discuss it'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he discusses the Seifa - he comes to learn from the following law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Reuven may tell Shimon 'Guard my produce in your Techum, and I will guard your produce in my Techum'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Aba Sha'ul says to the first Tana, you agree that one may say 'Guard my produce in your Techum, and I will guard your produce in my Techum' [so you should agree that he may Machshich for it, for if one may discuss...]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Aba Sha'ul could have said just this - why did he say 'the general rule is'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes the following law (going to attend to the needs of a bride or Mes):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not Machshich to bring an animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one's animal was outside the Techum, he calls to it and it comes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Aba Sha'ul says, the general rule is - if one may discuss doing something, he may Machshich for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One may Machshich to attend to the needs of a bride or a Mes, to bring a coffin or shrouds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>One may say [to a Shali'ach who will buy things for the bride or Mes] 'Go to place Ploni to buy; if you cannot find it there, go to Almoni; spend 100 - if you cannot buy it for 100, spend 200'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, one may not mention a price.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>MELACHOS</i> THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE FOR A JEW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may Machshich to attend to the needs of a bride or a Mes, to bring a coffin or shrouds;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a Nochri brought flutes on Shabbos, one may not eulogize with them unless they came from a nearby place (inside the Techum).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If [Nochrim] made a coffin or dug a grave [for a Nochri or to sell], a Yisrael may be buried in it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If they made it for a Yisrael, no Yisrael may ever be buried in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does it mean '[they came from] a nearby place'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer #1 (Rav):</span> [We know that] it came from nearby (inside the Techum);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> [Even if we know that they came from outside the city,] we are lenient to assume that it came from inside the Techum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1A - Support (for Shmuel - Mishnah):</span> If they made a coffin or dug a grave, a Yisrael may be buried in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though we do not know whether or not it was for a Yisrael, it is permitted mi'Safek - the same applies to if we do not know if it came from outside the Techum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Another Mishnah supports Rav:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Yisraelim and Nochrim are in a city, and there was a bathhouse open on Shabbos - if the majority [of the residents] are Nochrim, one may bathe in it immediately [on Motzei Shabbos];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the majority are Yisraelim, one must wait the time needed to heat the water [after Shabbos].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If it is half-half, one must wait the time needed to heat the water;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehudah says, regarding a small bath, if there is 'Reshus', one may bathe immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is 'Reshus'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is an important official who has 10 servants that simultaneously heat up hot water for him for a small bath (we assume that it was heated after Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1B - Support (for Shmuel - Mishnah):</span> If Yisraelim and Nochrim....R. Yehudah says, regarding a small bath, if there is Reshus, one may bathe immediately. (The first Tana does not support Rav - when it is half-half, the water is heated for both.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rif) Answer #1 (Rav):</span> [We know that today] it came from nearby (inside the Techum);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> We are concerned [that they came from outside the Techum at night, even if it was inside the Techum in the morning; 'unless they came from a near place' means, one must wait on Motzei Shabbos until they could come from a near place].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Shmuel - Mishnah):</span> If Yisraelim and Nochrim are in a city...if the majority are Nochrim, one may bathe in it immediately; if the majority are Yisraelim, or if it is half-half, one must wait the time needed to heat the water (we are not lenient to assume that it was heated for Nochrim, or from Erev Shabbos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, regarding a small bath, if there is Reshus, one may bathe immediately (for the time needed to heat it after Shabbos is negligible). (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they made a coffin or grave [for a Nochri or to sell, a Yisrael may be buried in it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should have to wait the time needed to make it [after Shabbos]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1 (Ula):</span> The case is, the grave was dug on a major road (Yisraelim do not bury there, surely it was for the sake of Nochrim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That answers regarding a grave - how can we answer regarding a coffin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2 (R. Avahu):</span> The coffin is on the grave on a major road (surely, it is for the Nochri who will be burned in the grave).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TENDING TO A DEAD BODY ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [On Shabbos] we may do all needs of a Mes, e.g. anointing and rinsing, as long as we do not move a limb;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may remove the pillow from underneath it, so it will be on the [cold] sand [and not decay so quickly].</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">151b----------------------------------------151b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We may tie the jaw to prevent the mouth from opening more, but not to close it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Similarly, if a beam [supporting the ceiling] broke, we may put a bench or bed board (Kelim that one may move) there to prevent the ceiling from falling more, but not to raise it [for this would be building].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that a Talmid once followed R. Meir into a bathhouse and wanted to wash the floor and anoint (apply scented water to) it - R. Meir forbade both of them [because one may not anoint something that we may not move]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No - [he forbade anointing lest one even out holes in a dirt floor], floors can be confused with each other, but no one would confuse a floor with a Mes (and anoint a floor because they saw a Mes anointed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says 'We may do <i>all</i> needs of a Mes' - what does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> One may bring Kelim (e.g. glass) that cool and metal Kelim to put on a Mes' stomach, lest it burst; one may plug up the openings, lest wind enter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ad Asher Lo Yerasek Chevel ha'Kesef" - this refers to the spinal cord; "V'Sarutz Gulas ha'Zahav" - this is the Ever; "V'Sishaber Kad Al ha'Mabu'a" - this is the stomach (it is prone to burst); "V'Narotz ha'Galgal El ha'Bor" - this is the excrement.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> "V'Zireisi Peresh Al Peneichem Peresh Chageichem" - this refers to people who abandon Torah and make all their days like festivals [for feasting].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> Three days [after death], the stomach bursts and falls to the face, as if to say 'Take back what you gave to me'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not close the eyes of a Mes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Even on a weekday one may not close the eyes of one about to die - one who does so murders (it hastens death).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If one closes the eyes just before death, he murders;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like a lamp that is going out - if one puts his finger on it, it will extinguish immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If one wants to close the eyes of a Mes, he should blow wine into the nostrils, put oil between the eyelids, and hold the two big toes - the eyes will close by themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> One may Mechalel Shabbos for a live newborn baby, but not for David ha'Melech (the most prestigious) Mes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We may Mechalel for a newborn - we desecrate one Shabbos to enable the baby to later observe many Shabbosos; (Me'iri (Yoma) - we Mechalel even to extend life for a few moments, to enable him to repent in his heart; Bi'ur Halachah (329:4 Ela) - R. Shimon merely gives a reason to distinguish Chai from Mes - he agrees with Shmuel (below), that we Mechalel for any Yisrael, even a baby that will not live to do Mitzvos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may not Mechalel for David ha'Melech Mes - once a person dies, he is Batul from the Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Ba'Mesim Chofshi" - once someone dies, he is exempt from Torah and Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> One need not guard a live newborn baby from weasels and mice, one needs to guard Og Melech ha'Bashan (the biggest) Mes from weasels and mice - "U'Mora'achem <i>v'Chitchem</i> Yihyeh [Al Kol Chayas ha'Aretz...]" - as long as a man has Chiyus (is alive), animals fear him; once he dies, they do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> We have a tradition - lions do not attack two people who are together. (The above verse, "U'Mora'achem...", applies to at least two people together.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We see that lions do attach them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is like Rami bar Chama taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> Chayos rule over a man only if he appears to them like an animal - "V'Adam Bikar Bal Yalin Nimshal ka'Behemos Yidmu".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> One may not sleep alone in a house - if he does, he is possessed by Lilis (a Shed).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>POVERTY IS PRONE TO COME</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Do [Tzedakah] while you find [who to give to] and have [what to give] and while it is in your power (Rashi - while you are alive; Maharsha - before old age);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"U'Zchor Es Bor'echa bi'Mei Bechurosecha Ad Asher Lo Yavo'u <i>Yemei ha'Ra'ah</i>" - this is old age; "V'Higi'u Shanim Asher Tomar Ein Li Vahem Chefetz" - these are Yemos ha'Moshi'ach, when there will not be merit or sin (Rashi - for giving or refusing to give Tzedakah, for everyone will be rich; alternatively, there will be no desire to sin - Meforshim on Koheles Rabah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He argues with Shmuel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The only difference between this world and Yemos ha'Moshi'ach is that the kingdoms will cease to rule over Yisrael - "Ki Lo Yechdal Evyon mi'Kerev ha'Aretz".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ha'Kapar):</span> One should pray that poverty not strike him - [usually], if it does not strike him, it will strike his son or grandson;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Ki <i>Biglal</i> ha'Davar ha'Zeh" - a Galgal (wheel) spins in the world (the fortunes of people go up and down. Maharsha - wealth is determined by the Galgal of Mazalos - through prayer and merits, one who had Mazel to be poor can escape it, but it will return to his children; through great prayer and merits, he can spare even his descendants.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> We have a tradition - a Chacham will not become poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We see that this happens!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim become poor, but they do not go [begging] from door to door. (Maharsha - they make do with a small amount; alternatively, people bring to them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya (to his wife):</span> When an Oni comes begging, give bread to him quickly, in order that your children will be given quickly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">His wife:</span> Do you curse our children [that they will beg for bread]?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> A verse teaches this - "Ki Biglal ha'Davar ha'Zeh" - Tana d'vei R. Yishmael taught, a Galgal spins in the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Gamliel b'Ribi):</span> "V'Nosan Lecha Rachamim v'Richamcha v'Hirbecha" - only one who has mercy on people (this Midah itself came from Hash-m) will receive mercy from Shomayim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>TEARS DIMINISH SIGHT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>"Ad Asher Lo Sechshach ha'Shemesh veha'Or" - this is the forehead and nose; "Veha'Yare'ach" - this is the Neshamah; "Veha'Kochavim" - these are the jaws; "V'Shovu he'Avim Achar ha'Geshem" - this is sight, which deteriorates on account of crying [over a person's waning faculties as he ages].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> [The loss on account of] tears return only if the person is less than 40 years old;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Mascara helps sight only for one less than 40 years old - afterwards, even if he puts it on with [tremendous] sticks like warp beams, it will merely prevent deterioration, it will not improve sight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A thicker mascara stick helps more.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Chanina's daughter died; he did not cry over her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">His wife:</span> Did you [merely] lose a chicken?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> Why should I suffer loss of a child and blindness?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>He holds like R. Yochanan:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> There are six kinds of tears - three are good, three are bad;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Tears on account of smoke, crying and [pain in] the Beis ha'Kisei are bad;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Those on account of a salve, joy and [the smell of] nice produce are good.</p>
