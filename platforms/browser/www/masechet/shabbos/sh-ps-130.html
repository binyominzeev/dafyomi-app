<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS PERMITTED FOR <i>MILAH</i> ON SHABBOS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If one did not bring the knife for Milah before Shabbos, one brings it openly on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>At a time of danger (Nochri decrees against Milah), one brings it covered, with witnesses (so people will not suspect that he carries b'Isur).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer even said that we cut trees to make coals to make a knife (if needed);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Akiva says, the general rule is - a Melachah [for the sake of Milah] overrides Shabbos only if it cannot be done before Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Does R. Eliezer say that one brings the knife openly to show the dearness of the Mitzvah, or to avoid suspicion?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it is to avoid suspicion, one may bring it covered with witnesses; if it is to show the dearness of the Mitzvah, one may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Levi):</span> It is to show the dearness of the Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> One brings the knife openly, not covered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> At a time of danger, one brings it covered, with witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is done only at a time of danger.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that it is to endear the Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> One brings the knife openly, not covered;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Yehudah says in the name of R. Eliezer, at times of danger, one brings it covered, with witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do the two witnesses include the one bringing it, or must they be two people in addition to him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> At a time of danger, one brings it covered, with witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand if there must be two people in addition to him - but if only one other witness is needed, why does it say witnesses (a person is not considered a witness regarding himself)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> 'Witnesses' means, people qualified to testify elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FOLLOWING THE LOCAL <i>CHACHAM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Eliezer even said that we cut trees to make coals to make a knife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In R. Eliezer's region, they would cut trees to make coals to make a knife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In R. Yosi ha'Galili's region, they would eat fowl cooked with milk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Levi visited the house of Yosef the bird-trapper; they served peacock with milk - he did not comment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Why didn't you excommunicate them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> That is the region of R. Yehudah ben Beseira - perhaps he taught them like R. Yosi ha'Galili.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> It says "Lo Sochlu Chol Nevelah", and it says "Lo Sevashel Gedi ba'Chalev Imo" - the Isur of meat and milk applies to species to which Nevelah applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since Nevelah applies to birds, Basar v'Chalav should apply to birds!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ba'Chalev Imo" excludes birds, which do not have milk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> There was a city in R. Eliezer's area which conducted like him - people did not die prematurely;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moreover, Romi once decreed that Yisrael should not circumcise, but they did not decree on that city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Every Mitzvah that Yisrael accepted joyfully, like Milah - "Sas Anochi Al Imrasecha k'Motzei Shalal Rav" - they still fulfill joyfully;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Every Mitzvah that Yisrael accepted amidst strife, like Arayos - "Va'Yishma Moshe Es ha'Am Bocheh l'Mishpechosav", they were crying about family matters (relations that were forbidden) - it is still performed amidst strife, i.e. there are quarrels about every Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Every Mitzvah that Yisraelim were willing to die for when kingdoms decreed against it, like idolatry and Milah, they still solidly observe it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Every Mitzvah that they were not willing to die for at the time of decrees, like Tefilin, their observance of it is weak.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> One must [be able to] guard his body to wear Tefilin, like Elisha 'of the wings'. (Rashi - most people are unlike Elisha, and cannot wear Tefilin - this is because only he was willing to die for it, as follows. Rashba - we bring R. Yanai's teaching only to show that most of Yisrael were not willing to die for it (Tosfos - even Elisha did not admit that he was wearing Tefilin)- it was known that most people do not wear Tefilin (perhaps this means, all day long - <b>PF</b>).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> He must be able to guard himself from passing gas [while wearing Tefilin].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He need [only] be able to guard himself from sleeping [while wearing Tefilin, lest he pass gas - when awake, anyone can guard himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He must [also] be able to guard himself from sleeping (one must be conscious of them the entire time he wears them; also, lest he pass gas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he called Elisha 'of the wings'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Romi decreed to puncture the skull of anyone who will wear Tefilin; Elisha wore Tefilin in the market. An officer appointed to enforce the decree saw him and chased him; when he caught him, Elisha took the Tefilin from his head and put it in his hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>The officer asked what he is holding; Elisha said that it is dove's wings - a miracle was done, he opened his hand and revealed dove's wings. (Maharsha - the name also alludes to [a body clean like] angels, which have wings.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he say dove's wings, and not those of other birds? (Maharsha - he did not need to specify any species!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Keneses Yisrael is compared to a dove - "Kanfei Yonah Nechpah va'Kesef";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like a dove's wings protect it [from cold, and it uses them to fight off attackers], Yisrael's Mitzvos protect them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CARRYING WITHOUT AN <i>EIRUV</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Rav Ada):</span> Once, they forgot to bring a Milah knife from before Shabbos, and they brought it on Shabbos via roofs and Chatzeros - R. Eliezer was displeased.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">130b----------------------------------------130b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> Just the contrary - R. Eliezer permits!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Eliezer was displeased, for he permits via Reshus ha'Rabim (and prefers this, to show the dearness of Milah), but Chachamim were pleased, for they forbid via Reshus ha'Rabim and permit via roofs, Chatzeros and Karfifos (enclosed areas without a roof).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Chachamim forbid this!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Just like one may not bring it via Reshus ha'Rabim, it is forbidden via roofs, Chatzeros and Karfifos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> R. Eliezer and Chachamim that argue with him were displeased - R. Shimon was pleased:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Roofs, Chatzeros and Karfifos are considered one Reshus (one may transfer between them) for Kelim that were Shoves (at the start of Shabbos) in them, but not for Kelim that were Shoves in the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> (Shituf Mavoyos, i.e. jointly owned food, permits transferring between a Mavuy (alleyway) and [houses or] Chatzeros that open into it.) If Shituf was not left in a Mavuy, may one carry in all of it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps it is like a Chatzer - even if Eiruv Chatzeros was not left in a Chatzer, [one may not transfer between houses and the Chatzer, but] one may carry in the entire Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps it is unlike a Chatzer, for a Chatzer has four walls, a Mavuy does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Alternatively, perhaps it is unlike a Chatzer, for a Chatzer is used constantly, a Mavuy is not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Asi could not answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Another time, R. Asi said in the name of Rebbi that once they forgot to bring a Milah knife from before Shabbos, and they brought it on Shabbos - Chachamim were upset that they acted like R. Eliezer against Chachamim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Firstly, he is Shemuti (from Beis Shamai; Rashi - he was excommunicated);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Secondly, the Halachah follows the majority against an individual!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> The case was, Shituf was not left in a Mavuy; they carried from one end to the other (therefore, it was permitted. Tosfos - the knife was Shoves in the Mavuy. Rashi - it was Shoves in a house - since onlookers who see a knife carried in the Mavuy do not know if it was taken from a house, we are not stringent to postpone Milah in this case.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira (to R. Asi):</span> Does this mean if Shituf was not left in a Mavuy, one may carry in all of it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Asi:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Why didn't you answer me when I asked? Perhaps amidst your plethora of teachings, you overlooked it (Rashi's text - perhaps when you later reviewed your plethora of teachings, you came across it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">R. Asi:</span> Yes, that is the case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira citing Rav):</span> If Shituf was not left in a Mavuy, one may carry only within four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> R. Zeira said this, but it was not explained until Rabah bar Avuha came:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Avuha):</span> If Shituf was not left in a Mavuy:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If houses made Eiruvei Chatzeros with the Chatzeros [that they are open to], one may carry [in the Mavuy] only within four Amos [even things that were Shoves in the Mavuy];</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If houses did not make Eiruvei Chatzeros with the Chatzeros, one may carry in the entire Mavuy (this will be explained).</p>
