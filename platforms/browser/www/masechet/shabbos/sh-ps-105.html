<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>NOTRIKUN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> If he wrote one letter Notrikun, he is liable; Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where does the Torah write Notrikun?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan citing R. Yosi ben Zimra):</span> "Ki <i>Av Hamon</i> Goyim Nesaticha":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"<b>AV</b>" - I made you (Avraham) <i>A</i>v (a father) and <i>B</i>achur (choicest) among the nations;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"HaMON" (Hei and Ches are interchangeable) - you are <i><b>CH</b></i>aviv (dearest), <i>M</i>elech, <i>V</i>atik (wisest), and <i>N</i>e'eman (the most faithful) of the nations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2A (R. Yochanan himself):</span> "ANoCHI" (in the 10 utterances) is Notrikun - Ani Nafshi Kesivas Yehavis (I wrote and gave Myself [with the Torah]).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2B (Chachamim):</span> This stands for Amirah Ne'imah Kesivas Yehavis (Maharsha - a pleasant utterance was [automatically] written and given - the Torah attributes the writing to 'Etzba Elokim' for that is easier for people to fathom).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2C:</span> Some expound this backwards - Yehivah Kesivah Ne'emanim Imreha (Maharsha - it was given written, it may not be transmitted orally).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Tana d'vei R. Noson):</span> "Ki YaRaT ha'Derech l'Negdi" - [Bil'am's donkey] Yar'ah Ra'asah Notsah (it feared the angel, saw him and turned away).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Tana d'vei R. Yishmael):</span> [The barley for the Omer must be] "KaRMeL" - KaR MaLei (the straw is full with barley).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> "V'Hu Kilelani Kelalah NiMReTZeS" - [Shim'i ben Gera cursed David, saying that he is] No'ef (an adulterer), Mo'avi (forbidden to marry a Bas Yisrael, for he descends from Rus the Mo'avis), Rotze'ach (for causing the death of Uriyah), TZorer (one who causes pain), To'evah (abomination).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> "Mah Nedaber u'Mah NiTZTaDaK" - we (Yosef's brothers) are Nechonim (truthful), TZadikim, Tehorim, Dachim (humble) and Kedoshim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>YEDI'AH L'CHETZI SHI'UR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Gamliel):</span> If one wrote one letter in the morning and one in the evening, in two Ha'alamos (Tosfos; Rashi - because he had enough time to remember, it is like two Ha'alamos), he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Gamliel holds that Ein Yedi'ah l'Chetzi Shi'ur (if one finds out that he transgressed [b'Shogeg] half a Shi'ur, if he later completes the Shi'ur [b'Shogeg] he is liable, as if he did not find out in the middle);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim hold Yesh Yedi'ah l'Chetzi Shi'ur.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LIABILITY FOR WEAVING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If one wove three threads at the beginning, or added another thread onto something woven, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, whether he wove at the beginning or at the end, the Shi'ur is two threads.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one makes two Batei Nirim (passes warp threads through holes in a frame that lifts and lowers warp threads) b'Nirim or a Kirus (these will be explained), [or weaves a reed in and out when making a] sieve or basket, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one sews two stitches or tears in order to sew two stitches [he is liable].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yitzchak):</span> R. Eliezer is Mechayev for weaving two threads.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that he is Mechayev for three!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One discusses strong threads, the other discusses small threads.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> He is Mechayev for three strong threads, or two small threads - this amount will not come apart;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> He is Mechayev for two strong threads, or three small threads - this amount is noticeable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one wove three threads at the beginning, or added another thread onto something woven, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Chachamim say, whether he wove at the beginning or at the end, the Shi'ur is two;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>On the edge, the Shi'ur is two threads for the width of three Batei Nirim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like one who weaves a small belt - he is liable for two threads the width of three Batei Nirim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>The Beraisa is Mechayev for three threads at the beginning or adding one onto something woven - this is like R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If one added two threads onto a large amount of something woven or the border [beginning] of a garment, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Eliezer is Mechayev even for one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>If he wove two threads on the edge the width of three Batei Nirim he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like one who weaves a small belt - he is liable for two threads the width of three Batei Nirim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>It is Mechayev for two threads onto a large amount of something woven or on the border - this is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THREADING AND SEWING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one makes two Batei Nirim b'Nirim...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is threading two [warp] threads through heddle eyes (used to move the warp threads alternatingly above and below the woof. We explain like R. Chananel - there are many varied Pirushim on these words.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In a Kirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What it this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> It is a foot loom (Rashi; R. Chananel - it is a strainer).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sews two stitches.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This was already taught among the 39 Melachos (73A, and no Chidush is added here)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It was repeated on account of the Seifa, one who tears in order to sew two stitches [is liable].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also this was taught among the 39 Melachos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sewing was repeated on account of [tearing in order to sew, and tearing was repeated on account of] the Seifa (continuation of our Mishnah on Amud B), one who tears out of anger or on account of a Mes [is exempt].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who tears in order to sew two stitches.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">105b----------------------------------------105b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The garment had a protrusion (it must be torn to make it straight).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>LIABILITY FOR TEARING OR BREAKING KELIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one tore out of anger or on account of his Mes, or did anything destructive, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one ruined something in order to fix it, the Shi'ur to be liable is like one who fixes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Shi'ur to be liable for the following is twice Malei ha'Sit (this will be explained) - laundering, Menapetz (banging wool, or separating clumps into fibers, or brushing and combing it), dying and spinning. One who weaves two threads, the Shi'ur is Malei ha'Sit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If one tore out of anger, or if a mourner tore [his clothing] on account of his Mes, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though he desecrated Shabbos, [the mourner] fulfilled his obligation to tear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> He is liable for a Mes he must mourn over, he is exempt for any other Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah exempts one who tore for <i>his</i> Mes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is <i>his</i> Mes, i.e. he is obligated to bury it - but it is not one of the relatives over which he must mourn [and tear, i.e. a parent, child, sibling or spouse].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Mes was a Chacham, he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Everyone is a relative of a Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, everyone is like a relative of a Chacham, he must tear, leave his shoulder uncovered and eat the first meal after the burial from others' food in the street.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mes was not a Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Mes was a proper person, he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A person's children die in order that he will cry and mourn over a proper person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Does Hash-m take a 'security' from one who did not yet sin?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they die because he did not cry and mourn over a proper person.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If one cries over a proper person, all his sins are forgiven on account of the honor he showed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mes was not a proper person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he was present at the time of death, he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> If one was present at the time of death, he must tear - this is like a Sefer Torah that was burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was not present at the time of death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This resolves tearing on account of his Mes, but the contradiction regarding tearing out of anger remains!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> The Beraisa is R. Yehudah, who is Mechayev for Melachah she'Einah Tzerichah l'Gufah; the Mishnah is R. Shimon, who exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know that R. Yehudah is Mechayev when he did something constructive - is he Mechayev for something destructive?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avin):</span> It is considered constructive, for it calms his anger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is forbidden [for it strengthens the Yetzer - it is not constructive]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> One who tears his clothes or breaks Kelim in his anger is like one who serves idolatry, for this is the way of the Yetzer ha'Ra - today it tells one to do a small transgression, and another one tomorrow, in the end it gets him to serve idolatry! (Iyun Yakov - doing the desire of his Yetzer in place of that of his Creator is itself like idolatry.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> He learns from "Lo Yihyeh <i>Vecha</i> El Zar v'Lo Sishtachaveh l'El Nechar" - the foreign god <i>in</i> a person is his Yetzer ha'Ra (if he obeys it, in the end he will bow to idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, he did so to instill fear in his household;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>[To instill fear, Chachamim would do actions that <i>appeared</i> destructive -] Rav Yehudah would remove the edge from his garment, Rav Acha bar Yakov would break Kelim that were already broken, Rav Sheshes would throw brine at his Shifchah (it is not fitting to drink - Yoma 81A), and R. Aba would break a lid.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>CRYING OVER A PROPER PERSON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If one sheds tears over a proper person, Hash-m counts them and puts them in his treasure-house - "Nodi Sofarta Atah Simah Dim'asi v'Nodecha ha'Lo b'Sifrasecha".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one is lazy and neglects to properly eulogize a proper person, he should be buried alive - "V'Yikberu (Yehoshua)...mi'Tzafon l'HaR Go'aSH" - this teaches that he <b>ROGASH</b> (aroused) the mountain against them to kill them, because he was not eulogized properly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one is lazy and neglects to properly eulogize a proper person, he will not live long, Midah k'Neged Midah - "B'Sas'ah (in the same Se'ah (measure)) b'Shalchah Terivenah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> "...Ha'Zekenim Asher He'erichu Yomim Acher Yehoshua" (they lived long)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer: (R. Yochanan):</span> [Foolish] Babylonian! They had length of days, but not length of years. (Rashi - they lived well, but not long; Maharsha - they lived long, but not well, it was as if they already died).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Lema'an Yirbu Yemeichem vi'Mei Veneichem" - does Mezuzah give length of days, but not of years?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Berachah is different (it gives both).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If one brother died, all of the brothers should worry;</p>
