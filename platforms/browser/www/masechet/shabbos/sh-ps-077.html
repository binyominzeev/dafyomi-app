<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE <i>SHI'UR</i> OF <i>HOTZA'AH</i> FOR WINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> One must put a quarter Revi'is of [raw] wine in the Kos of Berachah, so that after it is mixed there will be a Revi'is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava - Mishnah):</span> Enough wine to mix to comprise a cup;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This refers to the amount of wine to mix a nice cup.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa of Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for all other liquids is a Revi'is. (This shows that a Revi'is of raw wine is not required - it does not show that the proper mixing is three parts water for one part of raw wine.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This is as Rava holds elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one measure of [raw] wine cannot be mixed with three measures of water (for then it will be too weak), it is not [proper] wine. (Some explain, if it has not been diluted with three parts of water, it is not wine, i.e. it is too strong to drink. However, Rava's teaching is brought (Bava Basra 96B) to show that wine made from dregs is considered wine if there are <i>at most</i> three parts water for each part of wine - if it is more concentrated, all the more so it is considered wine! Most people drink it stronger (see Tosfos) - it is unreasonable to base Halachah on a Diyuk from an individual (which the Gemara never spoke out), i.e. because Rava holds that less than three parts water per part of wine is too strong, anything weaker is not wine at all!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> [Dam Nidah is Tamei if it is the color of] two measures of water mixed with one measure of Sharoni wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Abaye):</span> It is unreasonable that one should be liable for [Hotza'ah of raw] wine on account of water in a jug [which could be mixed with it, but he was not Motzi it]! (Rashi - Abaye agrees that the Shi'ur is a quarter Revi'is, but he does not require a Kos Shel Berachah to be a Revi'is after it is mixed. Ri - he holds that the Shi'ur for raw wine is a Revi'is, both for Kos Shel Berachah and for Hotza'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to Objection #1 - Rava):</span> Sharoni wine is weaker than regular wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Objection #1 - Rava):</span> For drinking it is proper to mix wine with three measures of water - but this is not the right color to compare to Dam Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Objection #2 - Rava):</span> One is liable for Hotza'ah of something important - the wine is important [because it can be mixed to make a Revi'is]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Noson):</span> The Shi'ur for congealed wine is a k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> R. Noson and R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah say the same thing:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> The following [is one of] six places in which Beis Shamai are more lenient than Beis Hillel - Beis Shamai Metaher Dam Neveilah, Beis Hillel Metamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, Beis Hillel Metamei only when there is a Revi'is, since it can congeal to a k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> They could argue with each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps R. Noson is Mechayev for a k'Zayis regarding wine [which is not thick], for a Revi'is congeals to a k'Zayis - but [perhaps he would Metamei] less than a Revi'is of blood [for it] congeals to a k'Zayis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps R. Yosi is Metamei a Revi'is of blood because it congeals to a k'Zayis - but wine is thinner, perhaps he would Mechayev for less than a k'Zayis, for it comes from a Revi'is!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>QUESTIONS OF SPELLING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kedai Gemi'ah of milk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Gemi'ah spelled with an Aleph, or with an Ayin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is spelled with an Aleph, like "Hagmi'ini Na Me'at Mayim mi'Kadech".</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">77b----------------------------------------77b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Gar'inin (pits) spelled with an Aleph, or with an Ayin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Ula):</span> "V'Nigra (will be reduced, just like pits are removed from food) me'Erkecha" (it is spelled with an Ayin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Omemos (dimming) spelled with an Aleph, or with an Ayin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> "Arazim Lo Amemahu (it is not dimmed (outshined) by nicer cedars) b'Gan Elokim" (it is spelled with an Ayin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Me'amtzim (to close the eyes) spelled with an Aleph, or with an Ayin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> "V'Otzem Einav me'Re'os b'Ra" (it is spelled with an Ayin).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SHI'URIM OF <i>HOTZA'AH</i> FOR LIQUIDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was Motzi Kedai Gemi'ah of animal milk he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Shi'ur for human milk or egg white is to put on the brush used to apply Kilor;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Shi'ur for Kilor is enough to rub it into water [and apply to two eyes (Rashi; Me'iri - one eye)].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Is this including the amount that sticks to one's finger, or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Enough honey to put on Kasis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This means enough to put on the surface of the wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Does it mean, to put on the entire surface - or just on the mouth (where a scab forms), but not the surrounding area?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HASH-M'S REASONS FOR CREATING CERTAIN THINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Hash-m did not create anything for naught!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A snail (or slug) was created for Kasis, the fly was created for [healing a sting of] a hornet [one grinds the fly and puts it on the wound], the mosquito was created for [healing a bite of] a snake, the snake was created for [healing] boils, Samamis (a particular spider) was created for [healing the bite of a] scorpion. (Maharsha - surely, damagers were created for punishment - Rav Yehudah teaches about things without an apparent reason.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is the snake cure done?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One cooks together a black and white snake, and rubs it on the wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are five cases where the weak strong the weak:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The lion fears the Mafgi'a (a small animal that makes noise like a large animal), the elephant fears the mosquito (lest it enter its nose), the scorpion fears the Semamis (lest it enter its ear), the eagle fears the swallow (lest it enter under its wing), the Livyasan fears the Kilbis (a small Sheretz, lest it enter its ear).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Tana learns from "Ha'Mavlig Shod Al Az" (Hash-m strengthens the weak to overcome the strong).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Zeira found Rav Yehudah very jovial, he was sure that he would answer any question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Why do goats go at the front of the herd, and sheep afterwards? (Maharsha - goats represent the Yevanim, their kings ruled in Bayis Sheni before those of Yisrael (represented by sheep).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> This is like the creation of the world - darkness preceded light (usually, goats are black and sheep are white).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Why is [the Ervah of] a sheep covered [by its tail], whereas goats are exposed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> People are covered [clothed] through sheep, therefore they are covered; people are not covered through goats, therefore they are not covered. (Maharsha - why was the [length of the] exile following Churban Bayis Sheni hidden, whereas the exile following Churban Bayis Rishon was known (through prophecy, it would be 70 years? The sin of [the people in] Bayis Sheni was hidden [Sin'as Chinam], therefore their Galus was hidden; the sins of Bayis Rishon were open (idolatry, Arayos and murder) therefore their Galus was revealed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Why do camels have short tails?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They eat foliage with thorns (if they had long tails, they would get caught in thorns. Maharsha - he asked why Bavel fell suddenly, the way one punishes an enemy; he answered, because they ravished Yisrael.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Why do oxen have long tails?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They live in swamps, so they need long tails to chase away mosquitoes. (Maharsha - why was the fall of Malchus Yisrael so slow (over 200 years, even though all the kings served idolatry)? This is because Hash-m punishes them bit by bit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Why do ants have soft antennae?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They live in the wilderness among willows - if their antennae were hard, they would get dislocated, blinding them. (Maharsha - why is the autonomy of Yisrael during Galus (the Reish Galusa in Bavel and the Nasi in Eretz Yisrael) submissive? Because they are among a harsh kingdom, if they displayed eminence Yisrael would lose their sagacious leadership.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If the antennae of an ant are removed, it becomes blind.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> When a hen closes its eye, why does the bottom lid (normally, the top lid goes down)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They live on [high] boards - if the bottom lid did not go up to keep out smoke, they would be blinded. (Maharsha - why do Yisrael look up in prayer - the Shechinah descended, to the Beis ha'Mikdash! After the Churban, the Shechinah went back to Shomayim, Yisrael look up and request salvation lest the Galus cloud their wisdom.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(D'vei R. Yanai):</span> This is to anoint a small limb (Rashi - a bone of the pinky; Rambam - the small toe) of a newborn baby.</p>
