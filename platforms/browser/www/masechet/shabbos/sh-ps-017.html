<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OTHER DECREES OF <i>TUM'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What were some other decrees?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> (Mid'Oraisa, Tum'as Ohel applies only under a covering at least a Tefach by a Tefach; mid'Rabanan,) any Kli as thick as a [standard] plowshare is a conduit for Tum'as Ohel (14).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> Surely, the one who said this erred! He heard that if a farmer was carrying plowshare on his shoulder, and one end of it towered above Tum'as Mes, he is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He did not realize that the farmer is Tamei because he touches the plowshare (Rashi - a Kli over a Mes becomes Tamei no matter how thin it is; Tosfos - he heard that the farmer is an Av ha'Tum'ah (Tamei seven days, he needs Mei Chatas to become Tahor), he did not know that Tum'ah b'Chiburim (touching something that is currently touching or towering over a Mes) makes an Av ha'Tum'ah) - he assumed that Tum'as Ohel applies.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> I can explain why the thickness of a plowshare was mentioned:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Kli over a Mes becomes Tamei no matter how thin it is;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is Metamei one who carries it [to become an Av ha'Tum'ah] only if it is at least the thickness of a [standard] plowshare (this is a decree on account of a Kli a Tefach thick, which brings Tum'as Ohel mid'Oraisa. Tosfos - the decree is needed only when Tum'ah b'Chiburim does not apply, e.g. a garment separates between him and the plowshare);3.  It is Metamei other people and Kelim [mid'Oraisa, through Ohel] only if it is at least a Tefach by a Tefach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> A standard plowshare is not a Tefach thick, but its circumference is a Tefach - Chachamim decreed on a Tefach circumference on account of a Kli a Tefach thick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Tarfon, there was no decree about this - he is missing one of the 18 decrees!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> He holds that Tum'as Kusis was on that day, and he holds like R. Meir (that there was a decree about forgotten vessels that collected water).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What were some other decrees?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa -Shamai):</span> If one harvests grapes in order to make wine, the juice that drips from them is Machshir them (15);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hillel says, it is not Machshir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Hillel:</span> Why do you say that one must harvest grapes in Taharah (even though the juice goes to waste, it is Machshir), but you do not require harvesting olives in Taharah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Shamai:</span> If you anger me, I will decree Tum'ah (Hechsher) even on harvest of olives! (Chachmas Mano'ach - if you [mistakenly] equate them, all the more so we must be concerned that others will do so, we must decree on olives also!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>A sword was inserted in the Beis Medrash (Yerushalmi - they were killing each other); Talmidim were allowed to enter, but not to leave (for they wanted to count, to see if the majority follow Shamai or Hillel). Hillel was submissive to Shamai like a Talmid; the day was as harsh for Yisrael as the day the golden calf was made. (Chasam Sofer - the Nasi (Hillel) was very modest, Shamai did not defer to him, just like Benei Yisrael did not defer to Aharon on the day the Egel was made.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Hillel and Shamai decreed [that one must harvest grapes in Taharah], it was not accepted; later, their Talmidim decreed this, it was accepted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for the decree?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ze'iri):</span> This is a decree lest one harvest in Tamei baskets.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand according to the opinion that a Tamei Kli causes liquids to Machshir produce inside (even without intent);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But according to the opinion that a Tamei Kli does not make liquids Machshir, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ze'iri):</span> This is a decree lest one harvest in baskets sealed with pitch (he is happy with the juice that leaves, it will not be lost).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> This is a decree on account of Noshchos (Rashi - grapes that are stuck together, one intentionally pulls them apart, knowing that juice will exude; Ramban - there is juice between grapes stuck together, it does not get lost; R. Chananel - grapes are 'bitten' by protrusions in the Kli or by the harvester, and juice exudes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Nachman):</span> Sometimes a person enters his vineyard to see if the grapes are ready to be harvested - he squeezes a cluster of grapes, juice splashes on grapes, they might still be wet at the time of harvest.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE REMAINING DECREES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What were some other decrees?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Tavi Rishba):</span> They decreed that if Terumah is planted, what grows is Terumah (16).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chanina):</span> This is a decree lest a Yisrael will [not want to give Terumah to a Kohen, rather,] keep Terumah to plant it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If a Yisrael does not want to give Terumah, he would just not separate [more than a drop]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the Yisrael could have exempted the entire harvest [mid'Oraisa] by separating just one wheat kernel, like Shmuel taught, but did not do so, we trust him [to give it to the Kohen].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> This is a decree lest a Kohen will keep Tamei Terumah (which may not be eaten) around [until it is time to plant it], one might come to eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What were some other decrees?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Ami):</span> They decreed that one who was carrying his wallet in Reshus ha'Rabim when Shabbos entered should [not carry it less than four Amos at a time, rather,] ask a Nochri to carry it home for him (17).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the last decree?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beili):</span> They decreed against bread, wine, oil and [seclusion with] daughters of Nochrim (18). (These are counted like one, for all were decreed for one reason, as we will explain.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like R. Meir - according to R. Yosi (who does not count vessels under a pipe (16B)), there are only 17!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There was another decree, like Rav Acha taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Ada):</span> They decreed against Nochri bread, lest one consume Nochri oil; they decreed against Nochri oil, lest one drink Nochri wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says that the decree against Nochri bread was on account of Nochri oil - what is worse about Nochri oil than Nochri bread?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they decreed against Nochri bread and oil, lest one drink Nochri wine; they decreed against Nochri wine, on account of [seclusion with] Nochri girls; they decreed against Nochri girls, on account of another matter (idolatry); another matter was on account of another matter (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this 'other matter [on account of another matter]'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> They decreed that Nochri boys are Tamei like Zavim, so Yisrael boys will not regularly be with them, lest they come to homosexuality.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, there are 19 according to R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He counts food and Kelim that became Tamei through liquids (they are Posel Terumah) like one decree (at the end of 13B, we counted them like two).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>STARTING <i>MELACHAH</i> BEFORE SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> On Erev Shabbos, one may not soak dye, ingredients [for dye] or vetch (horsebean, for animals to eat) unless it will get soaked before Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel permit [in any case].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Shamai forbid putting bundles of combed flax in an oven unless they will get warm before Shabbos, or wool in a pot [of dye] unless it will absorb the color [before Shabbos];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Beis Hillel permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Beis Shamai forbid setting traps for animals, birds or fish unless they might catch something before Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Beis Hillel permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Beis Shamai forbid selling to a Nochri, or helping him load a donkey or himself unless he can reach his destination before Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Beis Hillel permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Beis Shamai forbid giving skins to a [Nochri] tanner, or garments to a launderer unless there is enough time [to tan or launder them] before Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Beis Hillel permit all of these anytime before nightfall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</span> My father's house used to give white garments (which are hard to launder) to a Nochri launderer three days before Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai agree that one may put beams on top of olives or grapes in the olivepress or winepress [any time before Shabbos].</p>
