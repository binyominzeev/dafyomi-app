<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW THE <i>CHACHAMIM</i> PREPARED FOR SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Chanina would dress nicely at the coming of Shabbos, and say 'Come, let us go to greet Shabbos the queen!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yanai would get dressed and say 'Come bride, come bride!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rabah bar Rav Huna visited the house of Rabah bar Rav Nachman; they brought three Sa'im of wafers with oil (so he could choose the nicest).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar Rav Huna:</span> Did you prepare because you knew that I was coming?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar Rav Nachman:</span> Are you more important than Shabbos?! (We prepared to honor Shabbos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Aba bought 13 Dinars of beef from 13 butchers (to taste from the best); he would pay them at the door (alternatively - he would bring meat to the door of his house, and before going to buy more, he would command his servants) and say 'Hurry up'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Avahu would sit on an ivory chair and fan the fire;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Anan would wear black garments on Erev Shabbos (to show that we do not consider ourselves too important to engage in cooking);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'vei R. Yishmael):</span> One should not mix a cup for his master in the same garments he wore while cooking food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Safra would roast the head of an animal, Rava would salt a fish, Rav Huna would light the lamp, Rav Papa would twine wicks, Rav Chisda would cut beets, Rabah and Rav Yosef would chop wood, R. Zeira would kindle the fire with twigs;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak would go back and forth carrying nice Kelim and foods to get ready - he said, if R. Ami and R. Asi were coming, I would toil like this for them (all the more so, I should do so for Shabbos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>A certain man Yosef was known to cherish Shabbos; astrologers told a rich Nochri in his neighborhood that Yosef will consume all of his wealth (Maharsha - he already spent the amount of your wealth to honor Shabbos, he will be paid back). The Nochri sold all his possessions and bought a gem; he made a setting for it in his hat and put it there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>When the Nochri was crossing a bridge; a wind blew his hat into the river; a fish ate the gem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>The fish was caught on Erev Shabbos; people told the one who caught it to see if Yosef would buy it. He did; he found the gem inside, he sold it for gold coins that filled 13 attics.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">An elder:</span> He who borrows to honor Shabbos is paid back by Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HONORING SHABBOS THROUGH EATING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rebbi):</span> What is the merit of rich people in Eretz Yisrael?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> They take Ma'aser - it says "Aser Te'aser" - tithe in order that Tis'asher (you will become rich).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rebbi):</span> What is the merit of rich people in Bavel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> They honor Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rebbi):</span> What is the merit of rich people in other places?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> They honor Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> I was once hosted by a man in Ludkiyah; they brought in front of him a gold table which had to be carried by 16 people. Sixteen silver chains were fixed in it, bowls, cups, flasks and plates were fixed in it, and all kinds of special foods and spices.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When they bring it they say "La'Shem ha'Aretz u'Mlo'ah"; when they remove it they say "Ha'Shomayim Shomayim la'Shem veha'Aretz Nosan li'Vnei Adam".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>I asked him how he merited this. He told me that he was a butcher; he would save every nice animal for Shabbos. I blessed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Kaiser):</span> Why do Tavshilim of Shabbos smell so nice?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> We have a special spice called Sheves (dill) which we put into it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Kaiser:</span> Give us some of it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Yehoshua:</span> It only works for one who guards Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Galusa):</span> [It already says "V'Korasa la'Shabos Oneg" -] what does "Li'Kdosh Hash-m Mechubad" refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Hamnuna):</span> This refers to Yom Kipur, on which we do not eat or drink - the Torah tells us to honor it with clean clothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "V'Chibadto" - you should honor Shabbos by eating the meal earlier than on a weekday;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> You should eat later than on a weekday. (He and Rav do not argue, both hold like Rav Papa below.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Benei Rav Papa bar Aba):</span> We have meat and wine all week long - how should we make Shabbos different?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> If you normally eat early, eat later on Shabbos; if you normally eat late, eat earlier.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>In summer, Rav Sheshes would seat Talmidim [on Shabbos] in a place where the sun would beat on them [at a proper time to leave to eat; Ben Yehoyada - they would not leave, just they would move around, so Rav Sheshes (who was blind) would realize that it was time to stop teaching]; in winter he sat them where they would be in the shade [and get cold].</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">119b----------------------------------------119b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>When R. Zeira would see pairs of Talmidim learning on Shabbos, he would tell them not to Mechalel Shabbos (by neglecting to eat).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER WAYS TO HONOR SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Even someone praying alone on Shabbos night must say "Va'Ychulu [ha'Shomayim veha'Aretz...]"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> If one says "Va'Ychulu" on Shabbos night, the Torah considers him a partner in creation - we read it 'Va'Yichlu' - they (Hash-m and this person) finished. Maharsha - he publicizes that Hash-m created the world.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> What is the source that speech is like an action (Anaf Yosef - so one's speech is restricted on Shabbos, just like his actions)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Bi'Dvar Hash-m Shomayim Na'asu".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If one says "Va'Ychulu" on Shabbos night, the two angels that accompany a person on Shabbos put their hands on his head and say "V'Sar Avonecha v'Chatosecha Techupar". (Ben Yehoyada - his sins are forgiven in order that he will be considered a Kosher witness; Etz Yosef - it is very difficult to guard oneself from transgressing Shabbos - he merits help from Shomayim not to sin, even b'Shogeg.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> On Shabbos, when a person leaves synagogue he is accompanied by one good angel and one bad angel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If when he comes home the Ner is lit, the table and beds are set, the good angel prays that it should be this way next Shabbos - the bad angel must answer 'Amen' against his will; if not, the bad angel prays that it should be this way next Shabbos - the good angel must answer 'Amen' against his will.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One should always set his table on Erev Shabbos [for the evening meal], even if he only plans to eat k'Zayis;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> One should always set his table on Motzei Shabbos [for a meal, like one escorts a king when he leaves], even if he only plans to eat k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>[On Motzei Shabbos, drinking and washing with] hot water, and eating hot bread heal;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>On Motzei Shabbos they would prepare a calf that was a third grown (alternatively - third born from its mother) for R. Avahu - he would eat the kidney;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>When his son Avimi grew up he suggested that they could spare this expense by saving a kidney [from what was prepared for the sake of Shabbos] for Motzei Shabbos. They did so - a lion came and ate it (i.e. a calf, in place of what he normally slaughtered on Motzei Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If one answers 'Amen Yehei Shmei Raba' will all his Ko'ach (concentration), harsh decrees against him are torn up (Rashi; Maharsha - if one answers 'Amen Yehei Shmei Raba', Hash-m uses all His Ko'ach ("Yigdal Na Ko'ach Hash-m" - Bamidbar 14:17) to tear harsh decrees against him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Bi'fro'a Pera'os b'Yisrael b'Hisnadev Am Borachu Hash-m" - the reason the decrees were cancelled is because they blessed Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Even if he did idolatry, he will be forgiven - it says here "Bi'fro'a", like [it says regarding the golden calf], "Ki Faru'a Hu".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If one answers 'Amen' with all his Ko'ach, gates of Gan Eden are opened for him [to enter] - "Pischu She'arim v'Yavo Goy Tzadik <i>Shomer Emunim</i> - we read this 'she'Omrim Amen'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'Amen' mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> It is the acronym of 'Kel Melech Ne'eman'. (Tosfos - one should have this in mind when saying it.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CAUSES OF THE <i>CHURBAN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah brei d'Rav Shmuel):</span> Fires are common only in a place where Shabbos is desecrated - "V'Im Lo Sishme'u Elai Lekadesh Es Yom ha'Shabbos...v'Hitzati Esh...v'Lo Sichveh".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "V'Lo Sichveh"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It will be at a time when people are not around to extinguish it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Yerushalayim was destroyed on account of Chilul Shabbos - "Umi'Shabsosai Helimu Eineihem va'Echal b'Socham".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Yerushalayim was destroyed because they neglected to say Shma morning and evening - it says "Hoy Mashkimei va'Boker Shechar Yirdofu", and "V'Hayah Chinor va'Nevel...v'El Po'al Hash-m Lo Yabitu" (they do not declare His unity over His creations) - "Lachen Golah Ami mi'Bli Da'as".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> Yerushalayim was destroyed because they stopped children from learning from their Rebbi - "Shefoch Al Olal ba'Chutz" - the anger was poured out because children were outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Yerushalayim was destroyed because people felt no shame in front of each other - "Hovishu Ki So'evah Asu Gam Bosh Lo Yevoshu".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Yerushalayim was destroyed because they equated small people to important people - "V'Hayah Cha'Am ka'Kohen; Hibok Tibok ha'Aretz".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Amram):</span> Yerushalayim was destroyed because people did not rebuke each other - "Hayu Sareha k'Ayalim Lo Motz'u Mir'eh" - just like one ram's head is next to another's tail, Yisrael of that generation buried their faces in the ground and did not rebuke each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Yerushalayim was destroyed because they disgraced Chachamim - "V'Yihyu Mal'ivim b'Malachei Elokim u'Vozim Devarav umi'Tate'im bi'Nvi'av Ad Alos Chamas Hash-m..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it "Ad Ein Marpei"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> If one disgraces Chachamim, there is no cure for his affliction.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah):</span> What does it mean "Al Tig'u bi'Mshichai uvi'Nvi'ai Al Tare'u"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The world endures only on account of the breath (words) of children learning from their Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa (to Abaye):</span> Why isn't our Torah good enough?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> You cannot compare breath [from a mouth] that sinned to breath free of sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> We do not interrupt children learning from their Rebbi, even to build the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish (to R. Yehudah Nesi'ah):</span> I have a tradition from my (alternatively - your) fathers that any city without children learning from their Rebbi will be destroyed [with a remnant];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> It will be destroyed without a remnant.</p>
