<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO MAY USE THIS CURE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> A Seris (one who was already castrated) may use this cure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But R. Chiya bar Aba taught that [regarding Menachos,] all agree that one is liable for Mechametz (fermenting) after Mechametz, for it says "Lo Se'aseh Chometz" and "Lo Se'afeh Chometz" [to Mechayev for every step of baking, even if the dough already became Chometz];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree that one is liable for castration after castration - "u'Ma'uch v'Chasus v'Nasuk v'Charus" (the verse discusses blemishes of castration, it ends "... uv'Artzechem Lo Sa'asu");</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one is liable for Kores (disconnecting the testicles), all the more so for Nosek (Tosfos - totally cutting them off, but they are still in the sac; Rashi - removing them from the sac) - why did the Torah need to say "v'Nasuk"?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that one is liable for Nosek after Kores.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Someone too old to have children may use this cure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But R. Yochanan said 'These [cures discusses in Gitin] returned me to my youth (fertility)!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> A woman may use this cure (she is not commanded to have children).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan ben Berokah, who says that "...Va'Yomer Lahem Peru u'Rvu" was also said to women (they are also commanded to have children), how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5:</span> A woman who is sterile or too old to have children may use this cure.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>INGESTING VINEGAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one's teeth hurt, he may not Yigma (ingest) vinegar [on Shabbos];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He may eat vegetables dipped in vinegar - it is no problem if he gets healed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one's loins hurt, he may not anoint with wine or vinegar; he may anoint with oil, but not rose oil;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Princes may anoint their wounds with rose oil;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon says, all of Benei Yisrael are like princes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Acha bar Papa) Question:</span> Our Mishnah forbids vinegar for aching teeth - this implies that vinegar helps teeth - but it says "Ka'Chometz l'Shinayim uche'Ashan la'Einayim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The verse alludes to vinegar that comes from grapes that did not yet ripen; the Mishnah discusses vinegar from proper grapes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Both discuss vinegar from proper grapes - vinegar helps for a wound, but it loosens healthy teeth [from the gums].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may not Yigma vinegar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> He may not Yigma (put in his mouth) and spit out, but he may ingest and swallow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (Abaye):</span> Also the Mishnah forbids [only] to put in his mouth and spit out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2 (Rava):</span> It forbids even to swallow, but only after eating (it is clearly to heal); the Beraisa permits before eating (this is a normal alternative to dipping in vinegar).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Migo (since) it is permitted before eating, it should also be permitted after eating (even though it is clearly to heal) - Rava himself applies Migo!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> [On Yom Kipur, one may not bathe for pleasure. One may immerse in a Mikveh on Shabbos - even though this resembles fixing something, we do not forbid, because it looks like he is merely cooling off. Even though this reason does not apply to Yom Kipur (one may not enter water to cool off), it is permitted even then, for there is nothing permitted on Shabbos that is forbidden on Yom Kipur [on account of Melachah] - since it is permitted in Shabbos, it is permitted on Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava retracted from his explanation of our Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he retracted from saying 'Migo'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely he did not, a Beraisa says so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Anyone who needs to immerse [to become permitted to her husband] may immerse normally on Tish'ah b'Av or Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ANOINTING WITH ROSE OIL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one's loins hurt [...R. Shimon says, all of Benei Yisrael are princes].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Zavda citing Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav does not hold like R. Shimon (Rashi - regarding all laws or all his leniencies of Shabbos; Tosfos - we are thinking that R. Shimon permits when he does not intend to be cured, for it is Davar she'Eino Miskaven)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Simi bar Chiya citing Rav):</span> It is forbidden to wrap a rag tightly in the spout of a barrel on Yom Tov [even though he does not intend to squeeze out liquid]!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">111b----------------------------------------111b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Abaye and Rava both say that R. Shimon agrees about a Pesik Reisha, it is as if he intended.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Chiya bar Ashi said in the name of Rav that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah [regarding Davar she'Eino Miskaven], Rav Chanan bar Ami said in the name of Shmuel that the Halachah follows R. Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chiya bar Avin directly cited these rulings in the name of Rav and Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava and R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> Rav says that the Halachah follows R. Shimon, but for a different reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Shimon holds that rose oil heals [nevertheless it is permitted, for we never permit something to some people and forbid it to others]; Rav permits because he holds that it does not heal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> In the Mishnah, Chachamim permit princes to anoint their wounds with rose oil - this implies that [all agree that] it heals!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon permits, even where rose oil is scarce [and expensive, and it is evident that he anoints to heal]; Rav permits only where it is abundant;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Rav's area, it was abundant.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>KNOTS ONE IS LIABLE FOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is liable for [tying] knots of camel-drivers and sailors (these will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Just like one is liable for tying them, he is liable for untying them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Meir exempts for any knot that one can untie with one hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What are knots of camel-drivers and sailors?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They are the knots tied through the ring in a camel's nose or through the ring in a mast or at the head of a ship.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> These are not permanent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are the rings themselves tied through the nose or through the mast or head of a ship.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> One is exempt for any knot that one can untie with one hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achdevoy):</span> What is R. Meir's opinion about a [tight] bow?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he exempts because one can untie with one hand, he would also exempt for a bow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if he exempts because it is loose, he would Mechayev for a tight bow!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are knots for which one is exempt, unlike those of camel-drivers and sailors:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A woman may tie the straps of her cloak, threads of her hairnet, a belt fastened by straps, laces of shoes and sandals, drawstrings on pouches of wine and oil, and a garment around a pot of meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, one may tie [a rope] in front of an animal to prevent it from going out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> It says that there are knots for which one is exempt, unlike those of camel-drivers and sailors;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One is exempt, but they are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Seifa):</span> A woman may tie the straps of her cloak - this is l'Chatchilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, there are knots for which one is exempt, unlike those of camel-drivers and sailors, e.g. knots tied through rings a camel's nose, in a mast or at the head of a ship;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One is exempt, but they are forbidden (for sometimes one leaves them tied for a while);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Other knots are permitted - a woman may tie the straps of her cloak...</p>
