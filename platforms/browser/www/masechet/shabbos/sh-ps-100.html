<p class="dedicationbox">SHABBOS 100 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the thirteenth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED TO BE AT REST?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The following is obvious to me - water on top of water is considered Nach (if one takes some of the water resting in a Kli or another place, this is considered Akirah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a nut is floating on water, it is not Nach;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If a nut is in a vessel floating on water, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we focus on the nut in the vessel, and consider it Munach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we focus on the vessel in the water, and say that it is not Munach, for it moves?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yochanan ben Nuri and Chachamim argue about oil floating on top of wine:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If [Terumah] oil is floating on top of [Terumah]wine and a Tevul Yom touched the oil, only it is Nifsal (they are not considered connected, we do not consider it as if he touched the wine; the oil is only a Shelishi l'Tumah, it cannot Posel the wine);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan ben Nuri says, they are connected (both are Nifsalim).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS <i>MEVATEL</i> A <i>RESHUS</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If a pit 10 deep and eight Tefachim wide is in Reshus ha'Rabim, and one threw a mattress inside, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the mattress divided it into two halves, he is exempt [because each half is less than four wide. (Me'iri - in this case he intended to leave the mattress there to divide it; in the previous case, even though 10 Tefachim do not remain above the mattress, he had no intent for Bitul. Others explain that really, the pit was deeper than 10, 10 Tefachim remain above the mattress.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Abaye holds that a mattress is Mevatel a Reshus [even though people usually do not leave it there] - all the more so a Chulyah is Mevatel;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yochanan asked whether or not a Chulyah is Mevatel - surely, he holds that a mattress is not Mevatel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If a pit was 10 deep and four wide and one threw something inside:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the pit was full of water, he is liable; if it was full of produce, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Water is not Mevatel a Reshus (Rav Hai Gaon - the Mechitzos are still noticeable), produce is Mevatel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one threw from the sea into an intercity road (from Karmelis to Reshus ha'Rabim) or vice-versa, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Shimon says, if there is a ditch 10 deep and four wide  [in the sea floor] in the place to or from which he threw, he is liable (water is not Mevatel Reshus ha'Yachid).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>CHIYUVIM</i> FOR THROWING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one threw something four Amos at a wall - if this was above 10, it is as if he threw in the air (he is exempt);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If this was below 10, it is as if he threw on the ground;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one threw four Amos on the ground he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> When it was below 10, why is he liable - there was no Hanachah [outside of four Amos, for it bounces back]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The case is, he threw a fat fig-cake [it stuck to the wall].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one threw above 10 and it landed in a small hole [less than four by four], R. Meir and Chachamim argue about whether or not he is liable:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says [regarding Mezuzah, and would also say here] Chokekim Lehashlim (if there is a small hole in something thick, we consider it as if the entire thickness was carved out - therefore, if the wall is four by four, it is as if the hole is four by four);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim do not say Chokekim Lehashlim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one threw above 10 and it landed in a small hole, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If the sides of a mound rise 10 Tefachim over the course of four [horizontal] Amos (they are too steep to walk up, they are considered Mechitzos), and one threw something [in Reshus ha'Rabim] and it landed on top, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a Mavuy is level but the opening to Reshus ha'Rabim is sloped, or if it is sloped but the opening to Reshus ha'Rabim is level, it does not require a Lechi (vertical post) and Korah (horizontal beam) to permit carrying inside it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Chanina ben Gamliel says, if the sides of a mound rise 10 Tefachim over the course of four Amos, and one threw something and it landed on top, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one threw within four Amos and it Nisgalgel (rolled; Rashi - was blown) outside of four Amos he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If he threw outside of four Amos and it Nisgalgel inside of four Amos, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> [In the Seifa,] why is he liable - there was no Hanachah [outside four Amos]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The case is, it rested on something [outside four Amos, then rolled back].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one threw outside of four Amos and the wind blew it back inside four Amos, even if it later took it outside four Amos, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>If the wind held it stationary for a moment, even if it later blew it back inside four Amos, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> According to Chachamim (who do not say Kelutah k'Mi she'Hunchah, they exempt one who threw from Reshus ha'Yachid to Reshus ha'Yachid through Reshus ha'Rabim), if one threw within three Tefachim on the ground he is exempt unless it landed on top of something.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> We already know this from our Mishnah! R. Yochanan established that it rested on something [outside four Amos, then rolled back - he did not simply say that it was within three]!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">100b----------------------------------------100b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mereimar):</span> Our Mishnah is when it Nisgalgel - then, it will not stop (therefore he is exempt unless it rested on something);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava teaches about when it is not Misgalgel - since it will stop, he is liable even if it did not rest on something!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>INCONVENIENT PLACES TO WALK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one throws four Amos at sea, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If many people walk through [gravel covered by] a puddle, one who throws four Amos in it is Chayav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The puddle discussed is less than 10 Tefachim (Ritva - if it is deeper than 10 it is a Reshus ha'Yachid; Rashi - it is Karmelis; Mishnah Berurah (345 48) - perhaps Rashi agrees that mid'Oraisa it is Reshus ha'Yachid);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one throws into a puddle that many people walk through, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We understand why the Mishnah mentions 'walking' twice - this teaches that walking with difficulty is considered walking, but usage with difficulty is not considered usage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But why does it mention 'puddle' twice?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> This is to teach that this applies in summer and winter:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it only taught about summer, we would have thought that that is because people often go there to cool off (but in winter it is not Reshus ha'Rabim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it only taught about winter, we would have thought that that is because people's garments are dirty anyway, so people often go there (but in summer it is not Reshus ha'Rabim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> This is to teach that this is even if it is four Amos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that it is Reshus ha'Rabim only if it is less than four Amos, but if it is four Amos, people go around it and do not go through it - the repetition teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> This is to teach that this is even if it is less than four (Rashi - Amos; Rambam - Tefachim):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that it is Reshus ha'Rabim only if it is four, but if it is less, people step over it and do not go through it - the repetition teaches that this is not so. (Rashash questions Rashi, for even three Amos is too big to step over. Rashi himself (113B) says that the size of a normal step is one Amah. This is not difficult for the Rambam - since a person's foot is about half an Amah, if the puddle is four Tefachim, if one takes normal steps, part of his foot will be in the puddle.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This is like Rav Ashi taught elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> If one threw something and it landed on a plank of a bridge that is not in line with the others, [even though some people skip over it, since others walk on it] he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>TRANSFERRING BETWEEN A SHIP AND THE SEA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one throws from the sea to the land or vice-versa, or from the sea to a ship or vice-versa, or from one ship to another, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If ships are tied to each other, one may carry from one to the other; if they are not tied, even if they are near each other, one may not carry from one to the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> If one extends a ledge of any size out of a Sefinah (ship), he may draw water from the sea (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda and Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> He must extend an area four by four [Tefachim, surrounded by short walls] to permit drawing water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>(All agree that Karmelis extends up to 10 Tefachim, above this is Makom Patur.) Rav Huna says that a ledge of any size suffices - he holds that Karmelis begins at the sea floor, the air above the water is Makom Patur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Letter of the law, he does not need any ledge to draw water - it is required for a mere Heker (so people will not take from a proper Karmelis).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Chisda and Rabah require an area four by four - they hold that Karmelis begins at the surface of the water, all the water is like a thick floor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he will not make an area four by four, he takes from Karmelis to Reshus ha'Yachid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> Rav Huna says that a ledge of any size suffices - sometimes the water is shallow, i.e. less than 10 Tefachim above the sea floor, and he takes from Karmelis to Reshus ha'Yachid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Avuha):</span> We have a tradition - 'Sefinah' refers to a big ship that does not go in water less than 10 Tefachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The prow (front) of the ship is above the water, there the water can be less than 10 (perhaps one will draw from there)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Safra):</span> People at the prow hold poles in the water and feel for the ground to ensure that the ship will not go into water less than 10 [lest it get stuck].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Rav Chisda and Rabah require an area four by four - according to them, how may one dump wastewater out of a ship?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they spill it out of the four by four area for drawing water!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he would despise that place (he would not draw water from there any more)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He pours the water on the side of the ship, it descends to the sea by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even though he does not pour it directly into the sea, his Ko'ach (impetus) causes it to go to the sea!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim did not forbid Ko'ach regarding Karmelis.</p>
