<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE EFFECTS OF AGING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>"Ba'Yom she'Yazu'u Shomrei ha'Bayis" - these are the flanks and ribs; "V'His'avsu Anshei heChayil" - these are the thighs; 'U'Votlu ha'Tochanos" - these are the teeth; "V'Choshchu ha'Ro'os ba'Arubis" - these are the eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Kaiser (to R. Yehoshua):</span> Why don't you go to the debates between Chachamim and Tzedukim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> The mountain turned to snow, it is surrounded by frost (my hair and beard are white, i.e. I am old), my dogs (voice) do not bark, my grinders (teeth) do not grind.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Bei Rav):</span> [In old age, I look for lost objects that I did not lose (Rashi - I am bent, as if I seek a lost object; Etz Yosef - I look for things, mistakenly thinking that they are lost).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi bar Kisna):</span> [Walking on] two [legs, in youth] is better than three [needing to walk with a cane in old age] - woe to the one who was lost and does not return!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is youth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> Youth is like a crown of roses; old age is like a crown of thorns (or nettles, which are painful to touch).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(A Tana citing R. Meir):</span> Chew well (eat much), and it will strengthen your steps - "V'Nisba Lechem va'Nihyeh Tovim v'Ra'ah Lo Ra'inu".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Shmuel (to Rav Yehudah):</span> Eat [much] bread until age 40, until then food is beneficial; after this, drinking is beneficial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">A Tzeduki eunuch (to R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> How far is it from here to Korchina? (He said this to mock R. Yehoshua, who was Kore'ach (bald).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> It is like from here to Gozniya (like Guza (eunuch), alluding to his Mum).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The Tzeduki:</span> Goats are bald (have no wool), they sell for four (Zuzim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> People pay eight for a castrated ram (R. Chananel - for its skin, it is good for a wine pouch)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Tzeduki noticed that R. Yehoshua was barefoot (it was Tisha b'Av or Yom Kipur, or his foot was wounded).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">The Tzeduki:</span> A king rides on a horse, free men ride on donkeys, [regular] people walk with shoes - one who has none of these is worse than one who is buried!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Eunuch! You insulted me three times - you will hear three rebukes;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The radiance of a man's face is a beard; a wife gladdens a man's heart; having children is like an inheritance from Hash-m (Etz Yosef - <i>to</i> Hash-m, to continue serving Him after one dies) - blessed is Hash-m who withheld all three from you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">The Tzeduki:</span> A bald one quarrels with me?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> You, a castrated ram, initiated the quarrel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi (to R. Shimon ben Chalifta):</span> Why didn't I see you during the festival, like your ancestors came to see mine?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Chalifta:</span> The rocks (Anaf Yosef - simple questions) became tall (difficult for me, I am old), what is close became far (Anaf Yosef - I forget what I learned recently, as if it was from long ago - you would not benefit from my Torah), two [legs that used to suffice to walk] became three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>"V'Sugru Delasayim ba'Shuk" - these are the bowels; "Bi'Shfal Kol ha'Tachanah" - on account of the stomach, which does not grind; "Va'Yakam l'Kol ha'Tzipor" - even a bird wakes him; "V'Yishachu Kol Benos ha'Shir" - even singing voices depress him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Barzilai ha'Gil'adi said "Ben Shemonim Shanah Anochi ha'Yom ha'Eda Bein Tov l'Ra" - this teaches that [very] old people's minds fade;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Im Yit'am Avdecha Es Asher Ochal v'Es Asher Eshteh" - this teaches that old people's lips crack;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Im Eshma Od b'Kol Sharim v'Sharos" - this teaches that their hearing deteriorates;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Barzilai lied! Rebbi had a 93 year old Shifchah who would taste the food!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Barzilai lusted for relations, this causes old age to come prematurely.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> When Chachamim get old, they become wiser - "Bi'Shishim Chachmah v'Orech Yomim Tevunah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Amei ha'Aretz get old, they become foolish - "Mesir Safah l'Ne'emanim v'Ta'am Zekenim Yikach".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>"Gam mi'Gavo'ah Yira'u" - even a small mound seems like a mountain; "V'Chaschatim ba'Derech" - when he travels, he is fretful; "V'Yaneitz ha'Shaked" - this is the hip, it juts out in old age; "Va'Yistabel he'Chagav" - these are the buttocks (they feel like a heavy load); "V'Safer ha'Aviyonah" - this is lust (it ceases).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Kahana was learning in front of Rav. When he reached this verse Rav sighed; Rav Kahana concluded that Rav lost his desire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> "Ki Hu Omar va'Yehi" - this is [desire for] a woman (Hash-m decreed it - it defies logic); "Hu Tzivah va'Ya'amod" - these are children (Maharsha - Hash-m gave men desire for women, so that a man will satisfy his wife's desire for him and so he will have children);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A woman is a pouch full of excrement, brimming with blood [Nidah] at its mouth, yet everyone pursues her!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REWARD AND PUNISHMENT AFTER DEATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Ki Holech ha'Adam El Beis <i>Olamo</i>" - this teaches that [in the world to come] every Tzadik has a dwelling according to his honor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A parable - a king entered a city with his servants - all enter through the same gate, but each lodges in accommodations according to his honor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak):</span> What does it mean "Ki ha'Yaldus veha'Shacharus Hevel"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Things that a person does in his youth (excessive relations) blacken his face (weaken him) in his old age.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Ach Besaro Alav Yich'av v'Nafsho Alav Te'eval" - worms (consuming a Mes) hurt it like a needle hurts live flesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A person's Nefesh mourns [over his death] all seven days - it says "V'Nafsho Alav Te'eval", and it says "Va'Ya'as l'Aviv Evel Shiv'as Yomim".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If there are no mourners over a Mes, 10 men go to where he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A man died in Rav Yehudah's neighborhood; there were no mourners. Each day (of the seven days of mourning) Rav Yehudah led 10 men to where he died.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">152b----------------------------------------152b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>After the seven days, he appeared to Rav Yehudah in a dream and said 'You gave me serenity, you should have serenity.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> A Mes knows everything that is said in front of him until the Golel (Rashi - the coffin cover; Tosfos - a rock left on the coffin cover) is sealed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya or R. Shimon b'Ribi):</span> A Mes knows what is said in front of him until Stimas ha'Golel;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Chiya and R. Shimon b'Ribi):</span> He knows until the flesh is consumed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The latter opinion learns from "Ach Besaro Alav Yich'av v'Nafsho Alav Te'eval" (as long as there is flesh, the Nefesh is alive enough to understand);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The first opinion learns from "V'Yashov he'Afar El ha'Aretz keshe'Hayah [veha'Ru'ach Tashuv El Elokim]".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Veha'Ru'ach Tashuv El Elokim Asher Nesanah" - just like it was Tahor when it was given to you, return it Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like a king who distributed royal clothing to his servants. The smart ones folded it and put it in a box (Maharsha - it was given for working - they only used it for clean jobs, and put it away immediately afterwards); the foolish ones wore it while doing [dirty] work. Later, the king asked for the clothing - the smart ones returned it in nice condition, the foolish ones returned it dirty. The king was pleased with the smart ones - he put their clothing in the treasury, and let them go. He was angry at the foolish ones - he sent their clothing to be laundered, and imprisoned them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, Hash-m says about the bodies of Tzadikim "Yavo Shalom Yanuchu Al Mishkavosam", and about their Neshamos "V'Haysah Nefesh Adoni Tzerurah bi'Tzror ha'Chayim" (under Kisei ha'Kavod, the 'treasury').</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He says about the bodies of Resha'im "Ein Shalom Omar Hash-m la'Resha'im", and about their Neshamos "V'Es Nefesh Oyvecha Yekal'enah b'Soch Kaf ha'Kela" (they must be cleansed through punishments).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The Neshamos of Tzadikim are stored under Kisei ha'Kavod - "V'Haysah Nefesh Adoni Tzerurah bi'Tzror ha'Chayim [Es Hash-m Elokecha]";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Neshamos of Resha'im are fettered - two angels are at opposite ends of the world, they repeatedly sling the Neshamah to each other - "V'Es Nefesh Oyvecha Yekal'enah b'Soch Kaf ha'Kela".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> What happens to Neshamos of Beinonim (intermediate people)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Had I died [before you asked this], there would be no one to tell you!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> Neshamos of Beinonim and Resha'im are both handed over to Dumah (an angel) - Beinonim get a rest, Resha'im do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mari):</span> In the future Tzadikim will be dirt - "V'Yashov he'Afar El ha'Aretz keshe'Hayah".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A DEAD BODY THAT DID NOT ROT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Some diggers were digging in the area of Rav Nachman; someone who was buried there snorted at them; they told Rav Nachman, who came to talk to him. The buried man identified himself to be Rav Achai bar Oshaya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> But Rav Mari taught that in the future Tzadikim will be dirt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Achai:</span> I do not recognize Rav Mari (I am not concerned for his opinion).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> A verse supports him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Achai:</span> The teacher who taught you Koheles did not teach you Mishlei! It says "U'Rkav Atzamos Kin'ah" - bones rot only if the person was jealous.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Nachman felt Rav Achai - he was tangible. Rav Nachman suggested that he go to his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Achai:</span> You haven't learned Nevi'im - "Vi'Datem Ki Ani Hash-m b'Fischi Es Kivroseichem [uv'Ha'alosi Eschem mi'Kivroseichem]" (we must wait for Hash-m to take us out).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> But it says "Ki Afar Atah v'El Afar Tashuv"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Achai:</span> That will be fulfilled shortly before revival of the dead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (a Tzeduki):</span> You say that Neshamos of Tzadikim are stored under Kisei ha'Kavod - if so, how did the Ba'alas Ov conjure up Shmuel [to speak with Sha'ul (Shmuel 1:28)]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> That was within 12 months of his death;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> For 12 months after death, the body exists and the Neshamah goes up and down; after this, the Guf is Batul, and the Neshamah goes up and does not come down [unless it wants to - Tosfos].</p>
