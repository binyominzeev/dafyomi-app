<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FOODS PEOPLE DO NOT NORMALLY EAT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not clear out Tevel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches that even Tevel mid'Rabanan may not be moved, e.g. it grew in a flowerpot without a hole (it does not nurture from the ground).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Nor Ma'aser Rishon from which Terumah was not taken.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, a Levi received Ma'aser Rishon from a Kri; Terumas Ma'aser was taken but Terumah Gedolah was not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought [that it is exempt from Terumah Gedolah] like Rav Papa's question - the Mishnah teaches, this is not so, like Abaye's answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Nor Ma'aser Sheni or Hekdesh that was not redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they were redeemed, but improperly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ma'aser Sheni was redeemed on an Asimon (a slug), the Torah requires "V'<i>Tzar</i>ta ha'Kesef b'Yadecha", a [minted] coin with a Tzurah (form).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hekdesh was redeemed onto land, not money;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It says that one will give the money "V'Kam Lo" (then the Hekdesh will be [redeemed, and hence] his).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> And not Luf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may move Chatzav (squill) because deer eat it, and mustard because doves eat it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, one may even move broken glass, because ostriches eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Noson):</span> If so, you should also permit moving bundles of twigs, because elephants eat them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Ostriches are common, elephants are rare.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel permits broken glass only if he has an ostrich.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> If so, why did R. Noson ask about bundles of twigs - if he has an elephant, indeed he may move them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, R. Shimon ben Gamliel permits broken glass to everyone, for it is fitting to have an ostrich - R. Noson asks the same should apply to bundles of twigs, it is fitting to have an elephant!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The following Tana'im hold that all of Benei Yisrael are princes - R. Shimon ben Gamliel, R. Shimon, R. Yishmael and R. Akiva:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We already discussed R. Shimon ben Gamliel (he permits Luf and broken glass, since it is fitting for princes to have ravens and ostriches).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon - (Mishnah):</span> Princes may rub rose oil on their wounds on Shabbos, for they anoint themselves with it even when they have no wound;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Shimon says all Benei Yisrael are princes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael and R. Akiva - (Beraisa):</span> If Shimon owed 1000 Zuz, and was wearing a garment worth 10,000, we make him sell it and buy something fitting for himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael and R. Akiva):</span> Any Yisrael is fitting for such a garment (he need not sell it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Bundles of straw, wood...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If bundles of straw, wood and soft pruned reeds were prepared for animals to eat, one may move them; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if a bundle can be moved with one hand, he may move it; if it requires two hands, he may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span>Bundles of Se'ah, Ezov and Koranis (these will be explained):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one gathered them for fuel, he may not eat them on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he gathered them for (animal - Gra deletes this from the text) food, he may eat them on Shabbos, but he must cut them by hand, not with a Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He rolls them between his fingertips [to crush them], but he may not roll a lot, as he does on a weekday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The same applies to mint, rue and all spices.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Se'ah is pennyroyal (a kind of mint);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Ezov is hyssop, and Koranis is thyme.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But a man announced that he was selling Koranis, and he was found to be selling savory!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Se'ah is pennyroyal, Ezov is hyssop, and Koranis is savory.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MOVING FOODS WE DO NOT EAT ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>One may move salted meat;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> One may move unsalted meat;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> One may not move it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Huna was a Talmid of Rav, and Rav holds like R. Yehudah, who forbids Muktzeh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav forbids eating Muktzeh like R. Yehudah, but he permits moving it like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Chisda forbids moving unsalted meat - but Rav Yitzchak bar Ami visited Rav Chisda's house, and Rav Chisda commanded to move a [slaughtered] goose from the sun to the shade, lest it spoil!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An unsalted goose is different, for it is fitting to eat it raw.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may move salted fish, but not unsalted fish (people cannot eat it at all, and one would not feed it to an animal);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>One may move meat whether or not it is salted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Beraisa is R. Shimon, who permits Muktzeh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may move bones, for dogs eat them;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">128b----------------------------------------128b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>One may move rotten meat, for Chayos eat it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>One may move water that was left exposed (perhaps a snake drank from it and inserted poison), for one can give it to cats (it does not harm them);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel forbids leaving around exposed water, lest a person drink it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MOVING ANIMALS ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may tilt a basket on its side in front of chicks to enable them to climb or descend on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a hen fled, one may push it [with his hands] until it enters [the coop];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may Medadeh calves and colts (hold them and make them to walk);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A woman may Medadeh her son;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah says, this is if he picks up his feet and steps - but if he drags his feet, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> If an animal fell into an irrigation ditch, one puts pillows and blankets under it - if it climbs out, fine (but one may not take it out).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If an animal fell into an irrigation ditch, one brings food to it so it will not die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One brings food to it, not pillows and blankets!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One may put pillows and blankets only if it is impossible to bring food to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This will make the pillows and blankets Muktzeh (they may not be moved when the animal is on them - one may not make a Kli Muktzeh, for this is like breaking it or plastering it in place)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that the Isur to make a Kli Muktzeh is only mid'Rabanan, and mid'Oraisa we are concerned for pain to animals - the mid'Oraisa concern overrides the mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a hen fled [one may push it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One may push it, one may not Medadeh it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Our Mishnah teaches like the following Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may Medadeh Chayos, Behemos and birds in a Chatzer, but not in Reshus ha'Rabim, but not a hen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a hen forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It lifts itself off the ground (then, the person is really carrying it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One may Medadeh Chayos, Behemos and birds in a Chatzer, but not in Reshus ha'Rabim; a woman may Medadeh her son in Reshus ha'Rabim, there is no need to say it is permitted in a Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> One may not Oker (lift off the ground) Chayos, Behemos or birds in a Chatzer, but one may push them, until they enter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says one may not Oker - implying that one may Medadeh; then it says one may push them - implying that one may not Medadeh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Seifa applies to a hen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If one slaughters a hen, he should bend its feet against the ground or lift it totally off the ground (lest it dig its feet into the ground, and the Simanim will be uprooted).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HELPING ANIMALS GIVE BIRTH ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not pull the fetus from an animal on Yom Tov, but he may help it give birth (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may pull the fetus from a woman on Shabbos, call a midwife from another place, Mechalel Shabbos for her (the mother), and tie the umbilical cord;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, one may even cut it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One may do all needs of Milah (circumcision) on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How may one help an animal give birth?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> One holds the baby so it does not fall to the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> One presses on the mother to help push the fetus out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yehudah - Beraisa):</span> To help an animal give birth, one holds the baby so it does not fall to the ground, and blows into its nose (it is clogged with mucus), and puts the udder into its mouth so it will nurse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, on Yom Tov we would make a Tahor mother love her calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What would they do?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> They put a handful of salt in the womb, so it will remember its pain of birth, and sprinkle on the calf water in which the placenta was soaked, so it will smell it and love it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We do this for Tehorim, not for Teme'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Teme'ah does not normally distance her child - if she does, she will not love it afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>CHILUL SHABBOS FOR A YOLEDES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may pull the fetus from a woman... on Shabbos, call a midwife from another place, Mechalel Shabbos for the mother, and tie the umbilical cord;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah permits to extract the fetus and call a midwife from another place - what is added by saying 'We may Mechalel Shabbos for her'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If she needs a lamp, others may light a lamp for her; if she needs oil, they may bring oil for her in the palm (a Shinuy (deviation) from the normal way (in a Kli));</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they cannot bring enough oil in the palm, they bring in their hair (they anoint their hair with oil, the Yoledes will wipe herself on their hair); if this will not suffice, they may bring in a Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa permits lighting a lamp for her if she needs it - this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is she is blind;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought, since she cannot see it is forbidden - the Mishnah teaches that this is not so, it calms her to know that it is light and others can see her needs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If she needs oil [...if not, they bring in their hair].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [Why is this better than bringing in a Kli -] this is also Chilul Shabbos, i.e. squeezing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> Squeezing does not apply to hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Even if squeezing applies to hair, she brings a Kli in her hair - whenever possible, we use a Shinuy.</p>
