<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LAWS OF BATHING IN THE RIVER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> I saw R. Avahu swim in a bath [on Shabbos] - I do not know whether or not he was Oker (Rashi - picked his feet off the ground; Me'iri - splashed water).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, he did not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not swim in a pool of water, even in a Chatzer (where we are not concerned for splashing water four Amos - the concern is that he will make a flotation barrel to support himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is permitted when there are steep banks (Rashi - then it does not resemble a river, the decree does not apply; Me'iri - then, water does not splash to another Reshus), it is forbidden if the banks are not steep.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> I saw R. Avahu put his hands over his Ever - I do not know whether or not he touched it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, he did not touch it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> One who holds his Ever while urinating causes [thoughts that can cause emissions of semen, like the sin of the generation punished by] a Mabul (flood)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Here there was no concern, like the case of soldiers:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If soldiers entered a city in peacetime, open barrels of wine are forbidden [lest they were Menasech (poured) it to idolatry], closed barrels are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In wartime, all barrels are permitted because they do not have time to Menasech.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Because they are nervous, they do not Menasech.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Likewise, because R. Avahu was nervous, he would not have thoughts!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was R. Avahu nervous?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was afraid of the river.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Aba taught that putting one's hands over the Ever is like denying (showing that he is ashamed of) Bris Milah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That applies to one who descends to the river (he does not face anyone) - but when he returns from the river [he faces people on the bank,] it is proper to cover it for modesty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rava use to bend over (Rashash - even when descending, this does not show shame like covering it), R. Zeira walked upright (he was concerned for R. Aba's law).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rabanan of Rav Ashi's academy would descend upright, and bend over when returning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Zeira wanted to go to Eretz Yisrael, therefore he was avoiding Rav Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One who goes from Bavel to Eretz Yisrael transgresses an Ase - "Bavelah Yuva'u v'Shamah Yihyu Ad Yom Pokdi Osam" (Yisrael should remain there until Hash-m redeems them; R. Zeira held that the verse refers to Klei ha'Mikdash).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Zeira decided to hear another teaching of Rav Yehudah before leaving. He found him in the bathhouse, and heard him tell his servant [in Lashon ha'Kodesh] to bring soap and a comb; he also said 'Open your mouths and let the steam in, and drink hot water of the bathhouse (i.e. even if it was heated for bathing).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> It was worth coming just to hear this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand what he learned from the command to bring soap and a comb, i.e. that one may speak secular matters in Lashon ha'Kodesh in a bathhouse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Open your mouths and let the steam in' teaches like Shmuel;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Letting heat into the body causes one to emit heat (sweat, this is healthy).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But what do we learn from 'Drink hot water of the bathhouse'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If one ate and did not walk four Amos before going to sleep (Rambam - if one did not walk four Amos [or exert himself in another way] before eating), the food [will not be digested properly, it] will rot [inside him] - this will lead to bad breath;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who eats when he needs to move his bowels is like an oven ignited with the old ashes inside - this will lead to a persistent odor of sweat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who bathed in hot water and did not drink hot water is like an oven ignited externally but not internally;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who bathed in hot water and did not rinse in cold water is like iron heated in the fire that was not put in cold water [to solidify it];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One who bathed and did not anoint [with oil (Tosfos - afterwards)] is like water on top of a barrel (it does not enter).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOT WATER FROM A KETTLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Mulyar and Antichi are kinds of kettles, the Gemara will describe them.) One may drink from a Garuf Mulyar on Shabbos (Rashi - the water is not heated [much] on Shabbos; Tosfos - one may mix the water with wine, it cannot cook the wine), but not from an Antichi, even if it was Garuf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is a Garuf Mulyar?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [It has two receptacles;] the coals are on the outside (some say - on top), the water is inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is an Antichi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> It is Bei Kiri (an oven like a Mulyar, it has a receptacle for water next to that for the coals);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is Bei Dudi (a big pot with two floors, coals are on the bottom, the water is on top).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Nachman says that Antichi is Bei Dudi - all the more so he forbids drinking from Bei Kiri (it is hotter, for it is constantly heated for the sake of cooking);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rabah says that Antichi is Bei Kiri - but he permits drinking from Bei Dudi (it is like Mulyar).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Nachman - Beraisa):</span> One may not drink from an Antichi, even if it was Garuf v'Katum, for the floor (some say - copper) radiates much heat.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PUTTING WATER INTO A HOT KETTLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one cleared a [hot] kettle, one may not put water in it to get hot (this entire Mishnah will be explained), but one may put water in it or in a cup to become lukewarm.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ada bar Masnah):</span> If one cleared (emptied) the water out of a kettle, one may not put a small amount of water in it to get hot, but one may put much water in it to become lukewarm.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This (putting cold water in hot metal) is Metzaref (solidifies the metal, this is forbidden on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does not intend to Metzaref - the Mishnah is like R. Shimon, who permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven (something which may result in a transgression, if one does not intend for it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah does not say that he cleared <i>out of</i> a kettle, rather, he cleared a kettle!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> If one cleared a kettle [off a fire], one may not put a small amount of water in it to get hot, but one may put much water in it to become lukewarm;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one emptied the water out of a kettle, one may not put any amount of water in it, for it is Metzaref;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah is like R. Yehudah, who forbids Davar she'Eino Miskaven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> It is permitted to put water in it to become lukewarm, but not [in order] to Metzaref.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is permitted even to Metzaref.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, one may not intend to Metzaref!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Rav permits only a Shi'ur [amount] of water which will become lukewarm, but not a Shi'ur to Metzaref;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel permits even a Shi'ur to Metzaref.</p>
