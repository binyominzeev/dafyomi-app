<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TRANSGRESSIONS IN THE HOUSE OF THE <i>REISH GALUSA</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rabah and R. Zeira visited the Reish Galusa's house; they saw a slave put a flask of [cold] water on top of a kettle. Rabah rebuked him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> It is permitted to put a kettle on top of a kettle!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> It is permitted to keep the top kettle warm in that way - here, he heats cold water for the first time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The slave spread a turban over a flask and put a ladle on top; Rabah rebuked him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> What is wrong with this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> See what will happen!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The slave later squeezed out water absorbed in the turban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Since people may come to squeeze, why do Chachamim permit spreading a cloth over a flask?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> We are not concerned lest one squeeze a cloth, for people do not care if it is wet; people do not want a turban to be wet.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MOVING MATERIALS USED FOR <i>HATMANAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [Hatmanah in the following is permitted if they are dry and forbidden if they are moist -] straw...[tufts].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Masnah):</span> If one did Hatmanah in tufts, may he move them on Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> If someone has no straw, will he squander tufts [to dedicate them for Hatmanah?! Even if he used them now for Hatmanah, surely they are still destined to be used to make felt, they are Muktzeh.]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Hatmanah is permitted in wool shearings, or pieces of combed wool, or in strips of purple wool, and in tufts, but we may not move them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Beraisa means, if one was not Matmin in them, they may not be moved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that they may be moved because one can lie on them - the Beraisa teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Chisda permitted returning tufts to a pillow [from which they fell out].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chanan bar Chisda - Beraisa):</span> One may untie the neck-opening of a garment [tied by a launderer], but one may not open it for the first time;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not insert tufts in a pillows or blanket on Yom Tov, there is no need to say it is forbidden on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is forbidden to insert tufts for the first time (this if Makeh b'Patish, finishing a Kli), but one may return them if they fell out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One may not insert tufts [for the first time] in a pillow or blanket on Yom Tov, there is no need to say it is forbidden on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they fell out one may return them on Shabbos, there is no need to say it is permitted on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>UTENSILS</i> THAT ARE CONSIDERED CONNECTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one opens the neck-opening of a garment for the first time, he must bring a Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> Why is this different than a cork of a barrel (one may puncture it)?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The garment is all connected, the cork is separate from the barrel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah - Mishnah #1):</span> Clothes tied together for the sake of laundering (so small items will not get lost), or garments tied with Sha'atnez (e.g. wool garments connected by a thread of linen) are connected regarding Tum'ah (if Tum'as touches one, all become Tamei) until one begins to untie them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It is connected even when not in use.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #2):</span> If a stick was used for a handle for an axe, it is connected [regarding Tum'ah] while it is being used.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It is not connected when it is not in use!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An axe handle is not connected when not in use because one normally throws it in the wood pile - clothes tied together are connected when not in use because one leaves them connected, in case they will get dirty and he will have to wash them again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana says that anything connected is like what it is connected to [regarding Tum'ah]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda or Rav Kahana or Rava, citing Rav Yehudah):</span> It is R. Meir:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> A receptacle in the wall of a Kirah for oil (to warm it), spices or a Ner is Mekabel Tum'ah through Maga [if something touches the Kirah], not through the airspace [of the Kirah];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon is Metaher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand R. Shimon - he does not consider these like [part of] the Kirah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But if R. Meir considers them like the Kirah, they should Mekabel Tum'ah even through the airspace; if they are not like the Kirah, they should not Mekabel Tum'ah through Maga!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mid'Oraisa, they are not like the Kirah; mid'Rabanan, they are.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, they should Mekabel Tum'ah even through the airspace!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim decreed that they are not, so people will know that the Tum'ah is only mid'Rabanan and therefore we do not burn Terumah or Kodshim on account of it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Scissors that come apart, and a [carpenter's] plane (the blade can be removed from the wood) are connected regarding [Kabalas] Tum'ah, but not regarding Haza'ah (one must sprinkle Mei Chatas on each part by itself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they are considered connected, they should be connected even for Haza'ah; if they are not connected, they should not be connected for Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Mid'Oraisa, when they are being used, they are connected, at other times they are not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim decreed [to consider them connected for] Tum'ah when they are not being used on account of when they are being used, and they decreed [to consider them disconnected for] Haza'ah when they are being used on account of when they are not.</p>
