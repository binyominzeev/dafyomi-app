<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A TUFT IN THE EAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She may go out with a tuft in her ear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Yechezkeil - Beraisa):</span> It must be tied in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She may go out with a tuft in her sandal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Yechezkeil - Beraisa):</span> It must be tied in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She may go out with a tuft to absorb Dam Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> It must be tied between her thighs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> It need not be tied - since it is repulsive, we are not concerned lest she remove it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If it has a handle, what is the law? (Rashi - he asks about the tuft for Dam Nidah, she can remove it without touching it. Rashba - he asks about tufts in the ear or shoe, the handle keeps them in place.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> It is permitted [even if it is not tied].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Yochanan also permitted this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Yochanan went to the Beis Medrash [on Shabbos], with a tuft in his ear (it was not tied) - his colleagues objected (Rashi - he passed through Reshus ha'Rabim;Tosfos ha'Rosh - he passed through a Chatzer).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Yanai went in Karmelis with a tuft in his ear (it was not tied) - his entire generation objected.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (against both of them):</span> But Rami bar Yechezkeil's Beraisa requires it to be tied!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is if it does not fit tightly - their tufts fit snugly.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CARRYING THINGS IN THE MOUTH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She may go out with a pepper or salt crystal...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A pepper is to counter bad breath, a salt crystal is to heal teeth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Or anything in her mouth [is permitted].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>[This includes] ginger or cinnamon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Meir permits to go out with an artificial [or] golden tooth; Chachamim forbid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> They argue only about a golden tooth. (Chachamim forbid, lest she will show it to others, or she will remove it to avoid ridicule, or it will fall and she will carry it), but all permit a silver tooth (it is not so special that she will show it off, or carry it if it falls; it is inconspicuous, people will not mock her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> All permit a silver tooth;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi permits a golden tooth, Chachamim forbid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The following Tana'im are not concerned lest a woman remove something that will cause shame to herself - Rebbi (regarding a gold tooth), R. Eliezer and R. Shimon ben Elazar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> She is exempt if she went out with Koveles (spices bound together) or a flask of balsam oil (it is even permitted - she will not show it off, for it is worn to cover up body odor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> The general rule is - she may go out with anything under the headdress (she would not remove it, lest she expose her hair or lack of hair), not with something over the headdress.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>GOING OUT WITH A COIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She may go out with a coin on Tzinis (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Young girls may go out with strings [through holes pierced in their ears], or even with chips of wood;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Benos Yisrael in Arab lands may go out with their faces totally covered, except for their eyes; Benos Yisrael in Madai may go out with a cloak buttoned [closed];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Women anywhere may go out this way - Chachamim merely discuss the normal practice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>She may button on a stone, nut or coin, but she may not button on Shabbos (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is Tzinis?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a wound on the sole of the foot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a coin good for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is hard (it protects the wound, in case she will walk on thorns or pegs).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, a piece of earthenware could be used (this would be better, for it would be permanently designated for this - but a coin is normally Muktzeh!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Moisture exudes from coins, it helps cure Tzinis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, any piece of silver could be used (it need not be a coin)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The image jutting out of the coin helps cure it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, one could make an image on a piece of wood and use it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion (Abaye):</span> We must say that all of these properties of coins are beneficial.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>STRINGENCIES OF SHMUEL'S FATHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Young girls may go out with strings...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Shmuel's father forbade his daughters to go out with strings [on Shabbos], nor to lie together [before they got married];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He made Mikva'os for them in springtime, and put mats for them in fall (Rashi - lest mud be a Chatzizah in their feet; Tosfos - the mats were for privacy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah permits going out with strings - why did he forbid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His daughters had colored strings (perhaps they will show them off).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He did not let them lie on each other because he holds like Rav Huna.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If women rub [the Ervah of] each other, they are disqualified from Kehunah (Tosfos - they are Zonos; Rashi - they are not full virgins, they may not marry a Kohen Gadol - this shows that it is improper to do so, even when there is no Kohen Gadol.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">65b----------------------------------------65b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No - he stopped them lest this arouse their desire for men.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>He made Mikva'os for them in springtime, for he was concerned lest the river is mostly rainwater. (Rashi - rainwater is Metaher only if it is gathered, not if it is flowing - only Zochlim (flowing spring water) is Metaher when flowing. Ran - perhaps rainwater widened the river, immersion is valid only where it normally flows.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This is like Rav, who says that an increase in the water level of the Peras River shows that there was much rain in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>It is unlike Shmuel, who says that most of a river's water comes from its [banks and] source.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Shmuel also said that the only time one may immerse in a river is the Peras in the days of Tishrei (otherwise, we are concerned that it is mostly rainwater)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>BUTTONING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She may button on a stone, nut or coin, but she may not button on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah contradicts itself! (Since it already taught that Mediyos may go out with a buttoned cloak, surely 'She may button on a stone...' comes to permit on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Seifa forbids to button on a coin on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> May a woman scheme and use a nut to button on, in order to take it out to her son [to eat]?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He asks according to the opinion that permits scheming [to wear multiple garments at once to save them from a fire], and also according to the opinion that forbids;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Perhaps [R. Meir] permits only regarding a fire, for if we would be stringent, perhaps he will extinguish - but if we forbid here, she will not carry the nut!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Perhaps [R. Yosi] forbids only there, for that is how some people (clothing salesmen) normally carry garments, but he permits here, for no one normally carries a nut by using it for a button!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
