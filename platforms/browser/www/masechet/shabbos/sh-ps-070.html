<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN ONE BRINGS A KORBAN FOR EACH MELACHAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he remembered that the day is Shabbos...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the Reisha (Shigegas Shabbos and Zadon Melachos, he is only liable once) and the Seifa (Shigegas Melachos and Zadon Shabbos, he is liable for each Melachah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Safra):</span> In the Reisha, had he been told that it is Shabbos he would have refrained; in the Seifa, had he been told that he is doing a Melachah he would have refrained.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> He would refrain upon hearing that it is Shabbos only because he knows that he is doing a Melachah; he would refrain upon hearing that he is doing a Melachah only because he knows that it is Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> The Torah obligates a Korban on account of Shegegah - forgetting that today is Shabbos is one Shegagah, forgetting the Melachos is many Shegagos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...He is liable one Korban for every Av Melachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Chiluk Melachos (that one is Chayav a Korban for each)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> "Mechalaleha <i>Mos Yumas</i>" - the Torah obligates many deaths for one desecration (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse discusses Mezid transgression!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we do not need it to teach about Mezid (we know this from "Kol ha'Oseh Vo Melachah Yumas"), we use it to teach about Shogeg;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Mos Yumas" refers to [Korbanos, which cost] money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel should learn from R. Noson's source for Chiluk Melachos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Noson) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Lo Seva'aru Esh b'Chol Moshvoseichem b'Yom ha'Shabbos"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Eleh ha'Devarim...Sheshes Yomim Te'aseh Melachah" - this alludes to 39 Melachos told to Moshe on Sinai (Devarim (plural) teaches two, the 'Hei' teaches one more, the Gematri'a of Eleh is 36);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if one did all of them in one Helam he brings only one Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> "Be'Charish uva'Katzir Tishbos" (it is as if there are separate commands to cease from plowing and from reaping).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps one who plowed and reaped brings two Korbanos, but one does not bring separate Korbanos for other Melachos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 - Question:</span> "Lo Seva'aru Esh..." - why is this needed (all Melachos are forbidden)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was taught by itself to teach about the other Melachos - burning is an Av Melachah, one is liable for it by itself, the same applies to all Avos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel holds like R. Yosi, who says that the verse teaches that burning is only a Lav:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Burning was taught by itself to teach that it is only a Lav (without Misah or Kares);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Noson says, it was taught by itself to Mechalek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel should learn from R. Yosi's source for Chiluk Melachos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> "V'Asah me'Achas me'Henah" - sometimes one is liable Achas (one Chatas) for many transgressions, sometimes he is liable Henah, a Chatas for each transgression. (This does not explain why it says "<i>Me</i>'Achas <i>me</i>'Henah".)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> He also expounds the 'Mem' in "me'Achas" and the 'Mem' in "me'Henah" (this will be explained in (ii) - (iii)):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Achas is sometimes Henah (he is liable many times for one transgression), Henah is sometimes Achas (he is liable once for many transgressions);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Achas alludes to [a full Melachah, e.g. writing] 'Shimon'; me'Achas alludes to [a partial Melachah, e.g. writing] 'Shem' (the first two letters of Shimon; Rashi - he is liable because this is also a name or word Me'iri - he would be liable even if it was not a word);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">70b----------------------------------------70b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Henah alludes to Avos Melachah, me'Henah alludes to Toldos.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>Achas is sometimes Henah (many Korbanos for one transgression, e.g. Chilul Shabbos) - Zadon Shabbos and Shigegas Melachos; Henah is sometimes Achas (one Korban for many transgressions) - Zadon Melachos and Shigegas Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel holds that "me'Achas me'Henah" does not justify expounding like R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO FORGOT BOTH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one was Shogeg about both (Shabbos and the Melachos), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Because he was Shogeg about Shabbos, he is only liable once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> [It is just as reasonable to say that] he was Shogeg about the Melachos, he should be liable for each Melachah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> If he ceased [to do the Melachah, and now seeks atonement] because he found out that it is Shabbos, this is Shigegas Shabbos, he is liable only once;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he ceased because he found out that the Melachah is forbidden, this is Shigegas Melachos, he is liable for each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Ravina):</span> He ceased upon hearing that it is Shabbos only because he also remembers that the Melachah is forbidden; he ceased upon hearing that the Melachah is forbidden only because he remembers that it is Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it makes no difference why he ceased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mishnah):</span> There are 39 Avos Melachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need to know the number?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> This teaches that is one did all of them in one Helam, he is liable for each.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what case is he liable for each Melachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If he is liable for each when he forgot both, we can say that he forgot both;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But if he is liable only once when he forgot both, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It was Zadon Shabbos and Shigegas Melachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan obligates a Korban for one who remembered the Lav but forgot that there is Kares - he could say, this was the case;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But Reish Lakish obligates only when he was Shogeg even about the Lav - if he forgot all the Melachos, how did he remember Shabbos?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of answer:</span> We must say that Reish Lakish learns like Answer #1; we have no source that R. Yochanan argues about forgetting both!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #3 to Question (f:3)):</span> He remembered that it is forbidden to leave the Techum - the Mishnah is like R. Akiva, who forbids this mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>GREIRAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one reaped and grinded k'Grogeres (the volume of a dried fig, the Shi'ur to be liable for Melachah involving food) amidst Zadon Melachos and Shigegas Shabbos, and later reaped and grinded k'Grogeres amidst Zadon Shabbos and Shigegas Melachos, and then found out about [one or both of] his first transgressions (amidst Shigegas Shabbos), and separated a Korban (it atones for both Melachos):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he later found out about his latter transgressions (Shigegas Melachah, before offering the Korban), the first reaping is <i>Gorer</i> the second (causes it to get atonement along with its atonement); the first grinding is Gorer the second.</p>
