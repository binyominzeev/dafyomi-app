<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT SHOULD BE USED FOR <i>KINU'ACH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna (to his son Rabah):</span> You should learn from Rav Chisda, his teachings are very sharp!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> When I go to him, he discusses secular matters, e.g. when one goes to the Beis ha'Kisei, he should not make too fast nor press too hard, for the rectum rests on three 'teeth', either of these could uproot the teeth and endanger him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> This is essential for life, and you call it secular matters?! All the more so you should learn from him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> [On Shabbos] if one has a pebble and Cheres, he should Mekane'ach with the pebble, not with the Cheres [lest it uproot the teeth];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> He should Mekane'ach with the Cheres, not with the pebble [it is not a Kli].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> If one has a pebble and Cheres, he should Mekane'ach with the Cheres, not with the pebble.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Huna is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for Rav Huna - Rafram bar Papa):</span> The Beraisa discusses the brim of a Kli (it is smooth, it will not uproot the teeth).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda or Rav Hamnuna):</span> [On Shabbos] if one has a pebble and [attached] grass, he should Mekane'ach with the pebble, not with the grass [lest it cut him; alternatively, lest he detach the grass];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Chisda and Rav Hamnuna):</span> He should Mekane'ach with the grass (this is not considered moving Muktzeh, for it is attached), not with the pebble [it is not a Kli].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (against the latter opinion - Beraisa):</span> Doing Kinu'ach with something that can burn causes the anal teeth to fall out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The latter opinion discusses wet grass, it does not burn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda or Ravina):</span> If one needs to eliminate but does not, he will get bad breath;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Chisda and Ravina):</span> He will be sweaty and smelly:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who eats when he needs to move his bowels is like an oven ignited with the old ashes inside - this will lead to a persistent odor of sweat;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If one needs to eliminate but cannot, he should stand and sit and stand and sit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan of Neharda'a):</span> He should move to the side.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> He should use a pebble in the anus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> He should divert his mind.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If so, all the more so, he will not eliminate!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> They mean, he should divert his mind from other things.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah mi'Difti):</span> I saw a Yishmaeli stand and sit and stand and sit, until the waste flowed out like from a pot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Before beginning a proper meal, one should walk four Amos 10 times, or 10 Amos four times, and relieve himself. (It is a disgrace to have to leave in the middle for one's bowels.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>SHI'UR</i> FOR <i>HOTZA'AH</i> FOR EARTHENWARE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> The Shi'ur for Cheres is to put between pillars [so they will not lean];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, it must be big enough to stoke coals;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, it must hold a Revi'is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> There is a hint, not a proof for my opinion - "V'Lo Yimatzei vi'Mchitaso Cheres Lachtos Esh mi'Yakod".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> That is not a proof (the verse says that even my Shi'ur is important) - "V'Lachsof Mayim mi'Geve"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Whose Shi'ur is bigger, R. Meir's or R. Yosi's?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reasoning dictates that R. Yosi's Shi'ur is bigger (even a tiny piece can be used to stoke) - but the verse suggests that R. Meir's Shi'ur is bigger!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is unreasonable to curse that he will not find [even] a small Kli, and then to curse that he will not find a big Kli!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> R. Meir's Shi'ur is bigger - he discusses stoking a big fire (a big piece is needed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> That is not a proof...!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Meir answer this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He says, the Seifa increases the curse:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Not only will he not find something important to people, he will not even find something unimportant to people!</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK AMAR REBBI AKIVA</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE <i>TUM'AH</i> OF IDOLS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(Mishnah - R. Akiva) (The first Mishnayos of our Perek are unrelated to Shabbos, there were taught because they resemble the Mishnah (86A) which discusses the source to Mechalel Shabbos for a recently circumcised baby.) Question: What is the source that an idol has Tum'as Masa (one who moves it becomes Tamei)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Tizrem Kemo Davah Tzei Tomar Lo" - just like a Nidah has Tum'as Masa, also an idol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> If a wall of Reuven's house separated his house from a house of an idol, and the wall fell, he may not rebuild it (for this would benefit the idolatry);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, he retreats four Amos into his own property, and rebuilds it. (He fills the vacated space with thorns, so the idolatry will not benefit from it.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">82b----------------------------------------82b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he and the idolaters jointly owned the wall [and its place], half of its place counts towards four Amos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Its stones and dirt are Teme'im like a Sheretz - "Shaketz Teshaktzenu".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, they are Teme'im like a Nidah - "Tizrem Kemo Davah" - just like a Nidah has Tum'as Masa, also idols.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> [Chachamim say,] "TiZRem" teaches one to make idols foreign to himself, like a Zar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Tzei Tomar Lo" - do not tell it to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> All agree that it has Tum'as Masa, on account of the Hekesh; they argue about Even Misma. (If a Nidah sits on a rock she is Metamei garments underneath it, even if she does not weigh down on the garments [because the rock is very heavy or is supported on pegs]; alternatively, even though the rock is too big to be moved; alternatively, if her Mishkav is under a rock, it is Metamei a Tahor who sits on the rock.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva equates idols to Nidah - just like a Nidah has Tum'as Even Misma, also idols;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim equate idols to Sheretz - just like a Sheretz lacks Tum'as Even Misma, also idols.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Akiva learn from the Hekesh to Sheretz?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches about Meshamsheha (Kelim used for idol worship, they have only Tum'as Maga).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from the Hekesh to Nidah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches about Tum'as Masa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should have equated it to Nevelah (then we would not need the Hekesh to Sheretz to teach that there is no Tum'ah Even Misma)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is equated to Nidah to teach that just like Tum'as Nidah does not apply to a limb [that separated from a Nidah], the Tum'ah of idols does not apply to a 'limb' (a component part of an idol).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chama bar Gurya asked whether or not [the Tum'ah] of idols applies to limbs - he should learn from here that it does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Chama asks according to R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> All agree that idols do not have Tum'as Even Misma;</p>
