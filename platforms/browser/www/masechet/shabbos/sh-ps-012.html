<p class="dedicationbox">12TH CYCLE SHABBOS 12-14 - These Dafim have been dedicated by Ari Friedman and family of Lawrence, N.Y., l'Iluy Nishmas Ari's late father, Reb Yakov Yosef ben Rav Nosson Neta Z'L Friedman, who passed away unexpectedly this past 30 Nisan. Always brimming with joy and generosity, Jack Friedman exemplified true Ahavas Yisrael and Ahavas Chesed. May he be a Melitz Yosher for his children and grandchildren and for all of Klal Israel. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CHIYUV FOR CARRYING IN RESHUS HA'RABIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The pouch will keep his [other] garments clean (it should be considered carrying for this reason)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> This Tana holds that anything worn to shield from filth is not considered carrying.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man placed a bowl on a wall in order that the bowl should get wet, and water fell on it, the water is "Ki Yutan" (it is Machshir produce);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he placed a bowl so the wall should not get wet, water that falls on the bowl is not Ki Yutan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There is different, he does not need the water at all - here, he needs the pouch to shield from filth! Our case resembles the Seifa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If water was dripping into a bowl, drops that splash outside or float on top are not Ki Yutan (he does not want them), water in the bowl is Ki Yutan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye and Rava):</span> (Melachah she'Einah Tzericha l'Gufah is a Melachah done for a different purpose than in the Mishkan (Tosfos 94A), or one done to avoid something undesired, without producing something desired (Rashi).) Beraisa #2 is like R. Yehudah (who obligates for Melachah she'Einah Tzerichah l'Gufah), Beraisa #1 is like R. Shimon (who exempts).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'vei R. Yishmael):</span> A person may walk outside wearing Tefilin on Erev Shabbos close to dark (we are not concerned that he will forget to remove them before Shabbos and carry them in Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah bar Rav Huna taught that one must constantly touch Tefilin (when he wears them), we learn from a Kal V'Chomer from the Tzitz (that the Kohen Gadol wears on his forehead):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tzitz has Hash-m's name on it only once, yet the Torah says "V'Hayah Al Mitzcho Tamid", the Kohen Gadol may not cease to be aware of it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hash-m's name is written 21 times in each Tefilah, all the more one must constantly be aware of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Since he is constantly aware of Tefilin, he will not forget.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chananya):</span> A person must check his garment on Erev Shabbos [lest there is something in the pocket, he will carry it in Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> This is a great law of Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DELOUSING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not delouse clothing [or read by light of a lamp].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Possibility #1:</span> One may not delouse [even] during the day, lest he kill a louse - it is like R. Eliezer;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If one kills a louse on Shabbos he is [liable] like one who killed a camel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may not read by light of a lamp lest one tilt the lamp [an oil lamp is prone to get dim, tilting it brings more oil to the wick, making it burn better].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Possibility #2:</span> Delousing and reading by light of a lamp are both forbidden lest one tilt it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> One may not delouse nor read by light of a lamp.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why is this different than the Mishnah, which can be understood either way?! (Tosfos - the one who gave Answer #1 thought that the wording of the Beraisa is more like Possibility #2; alternatively, a Beraisa must explain more than a Mishnah, if the concern was killing a louse it should have said so.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> One may not delouse by light of a lamp nor read by light of a lamp - these are some of the laws said in the attic of Chananyah ben Chizkiyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Both are forbidden lest one tilt the lamp.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may not distinguish between his clothes and his wife's (which are similar) [by lamplight].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This applies only to city dwellers - farmers' clothes [are narrower, for one works in them] are easily distinguished, it is permitted by lamplight.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even city dwellers' clothes may be distinguished from young women's clothes (which are very wide) - it is forbidden only to distinguish from clothes of older women (which are also moderately wide).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should not delouse in Reshus ha'Rabim, for it is dishonorable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Similarly, R. Yehudah or R. Nechemyah taught that one should not make himself vomit in Reshus ha'Rabim for it is dishonorable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who delouses his clothes [on Shabbos] may roll the lice between his hands (to weaken them, so they will not return to him) and cast them down, but he may not kill them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Aba Sha'ul says, he may remove them and cast them down, but he may not roll them (lest he kill them - Aba Sha'ul obligates for killing them, like R. Eliezer).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah permits rolling them, but not kill them - even during the week it is dignified to do so (not to kill them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rabah and Rav Sheshes used to kill them (Rashi - on Shabbos; Riva - on a weekday); Rava would cast them into a vessel of water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman (to his daughters):</span> Kill them, so I will hear the death of my enemies! (R. E.M. Horowitz - he wanted to in publicize that the Halachah follows Beis Hillel [in the following Beraisa], who totally permit killing lice, even in a vengeful way, i.e. Tzericha l'Gufah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Beis Shamai forbid killing lice on Shabbos; Beis Hillel permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Beis Shamai forbid the following on Shabbos - to arrange marriages for daughters, to hire teachers to teach sons Torah or a trade, to console mourners, and to visit the sick;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Beis Hillel permit them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>BIKUR CHOLIM</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who is Mevaker (investigates the needs of) a Choleh (sick person) on Shabbos says 'It is Shabbos, so we do not pray [for a cure - in any case,] the cure will come soon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, the merit of honoring Shabbos [by not feeling pained] will cause Hash-m to have mercy (and cure him)!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, [he says] 'Hashem will have mercy on you and all Cholei Yisrael.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi says, 'Hashem will have mercy on you amidst all Cholei Yisrael.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Shevna of Yerushalayim says, when he enters [visits a Choleh on Shabbos] he says 'Shalom', when he leaves he says 'It is Shabbos, so we do not pray - the cure will come soon, His mercy is great - rest peacefully.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like which Tana is the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> If there is a Choleh in one's house, he must request mercy for him amidst all Cholei Yisrael.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> With difficulty, Chachamim permitted Bikur Cholim and consolation of mourners on Shabbos (for these sadden people).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> When we would go in back of R. Elazar to Mevaker a Choleh, sometimes he would say 'Hashem should bring Shalom upon you', sometimes he would say 'Rachmana (this is Arame'ic for 'the merciful one', i.e. Hash-m) should guide you to Shalom'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yochanan taught that if one prays for his needs in Arame'ic, the angels do not deal with his prayer (Rashi - to take it up to Hash-m), for they don't know Arame'ic! (Tamim De'im, brought in Etz Yosef in Sotah - if it is with great Kavanah, Hash-m heeds it in any case.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A prayer said in front of a Choleh is different, for the Shechinah is with him:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Anan):</span> The Shechinah is So'er (Mevaker) a Choleh - "Hash-m Yis'adenu Al Eres Devai", we read this 'Yis'arenu'. (We prefer this text, for according to our text (So'ed, sustains), this is virtually identical to Rava's teaching (below), they should have been taught together.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One who is Mevaker a Choleh should not sit on a bed or chair (some texts - or a high place), rather, he should cloak himself and sit [in awe] in front of him, for the Shechinah is at the head of a Choleh - "Hash-m Yis'adenu Al Eres Devai".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Shechinah sustains a Choleh - "Hash-m Yis'adenu Al Eres Devai (He will sustain us on the bed of the sick)".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>READING BY LIGHT OF A LAMP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not read by light of a lamp.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> This is forbidden even if it is twice the height of an [average] person above the floor (he is unlikely to tilt it to make it burn better), or two plowshare lengths above the floor, even the height of 10 houses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One person may not read, but two may (for one will remind the other if he goes to tilt it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> It is forbidden for one or two people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (R. Elazar):</span> If two people are learning the same matter, it is permitted; if they are learning different matters, it is forbidden (neither pays attention to the other).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> It is forbidden to read by light of a bonfire, even if there are 10 people (everyone is by himself, he will not notice if someone else goes to fix the fire).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> An important person may read by light of a lamp (he normally does not tilt it even on a weekday).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One may not read by light of a lamp, lest he tilt it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael ben Elisha said, I will read, I will not tilt it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Once, he was reading, and was about to tilt it - he said, how great are the words of Chachamim, who forbade to read by a lamp!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Noson says, he tilted the lamp, and wrote on his ledger 'I, Yishmael ben Elisha, read by a lamp on Shabbos and tilted it - when the Mikdash is rebuilt, I will bring a fat Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> We cannot learn from R. Yishmael, he would [waive his honor] and  act like a commoner for the sake of Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> A servant may check [the cleanliness of] cups and bowls by light of a lamp.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> A servant may not check cups and bowls by light of a lamp.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #1:</span> A regular [permanent] servant may not check (he is concerned to check very well), a temporary servant may check.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> Both refer to a regular servant - it is forbidden with an oil lamp, it is permitted with a kerosene lamp (it smells foul, he will not tilt it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May a temporary servant check with an oil lamp?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It is permitted, but we do not in publicize this (lest people will be too lenient).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> It is permitted, and we publicize this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>R. Yirmeyah bar Aba came to Rav Asi's house; R. Yirmeyah's servant checked by light of a lamp.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rav Asi's wife (to Rav Asi):</span> You do not do so!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Rav Asi:</span> Do not protest, he holds like his master.</p>
