<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OTHER TEACHINGS OF MAR ZUTRA BAR TUVYA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra bar Tuvya citing Rav):</span> If one learns anything from an Amgushi (this will be explained), he is Chayav Misah [bi'Dei Shomayim].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one knows how to calculate [the times of] Tekufos and Mazalos, but does not do so, others may not talk with (Ben Yehoyada - highly about) him. (Tekufos are solstices (when the sun reaches its northernmost and southernmost extremes) and equinoxes (when the noon sun is directly over the equator); Mazalos refers to the 12 constellations - the constellations have a fixed rotation, the same constellation is the first to 'rise' each night for about 30 consecutive days.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> Amgushi [discussed by earlier Chachamim] is a witch;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> It is a blasphemer [who constantly entices people to serve idolatry].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that Rav holds that it is a blasphemer, for he said that one learns anything from an Amgushi is Chayav Misah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This cannot refer to a witch - "Lo Silmad La'asos", but it is permitted to learn [witchcraft] in order to understand it and give Halachic rulings about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> It says about one who knows how to calculate Tekufos and Mazalos, but does not, "V'Es Po'al Hash-m Lo Yabitu u'Ma'ase Yadav Lo Ra'u".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> It is a Mitzvah to calculate Tekufos and Mazalos - "U'Shmartem va'Asisem Ki Hi Chachmaschem u'Vinaschem l'Einei ha'Amim" - Tekufos and Mazalos is the Chachmah that can be shown to Nochrim (through them, one can predict the overall weather for the coming year).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HUNTING AND KILLING ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Hunting a deer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one hunts a Chilazon and bruises [or presses] it with his hands to extract its blood, he is liable only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah is Mechayev twice;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> Extracting the blood is included in threshing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> It is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Chachamim hold that threshing applies only to Gidulei Karka (things that grow from the ground).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should also be liable for killing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> The case is, he bruises it after it died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We can even say that he bruises it while it was alive - he is Mis'asek regarding killing it (he is engaged in something else).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Abaye and Rava both say that R. Shimon agrees about a Pesik Reisha (it is as if he intended)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here is different, he prefers that it stay alive, for then the blood makes a clearer dye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Slaughtering.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is one liable for slaughtering?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> He is liable for dying (the blood colors the skin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> He is liable for killing.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">75b----------------------------------------75b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rav holds that he is liable only for dying, but not for killing?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, he is liable even for dying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> If I do not explain myself, later generations will mock my words!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>[One is not liable unless he desired the outcome -] he wants the place of slaughter to be bloodstained, so people will see [that it was slaughtered today] and come to buy.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TANNING, SMOOTHING AND <i>MAKEH B'PATISH</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Salting and tanning [the hide].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Salting is [a step in] tanning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> Indeed, we must delete one of these, and replace it by Sirtut (scratching a line where one wants to cut).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> If one salted meat, he is liable for tanning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> [He is exempt -] tanning does not apply to food.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Even Rabah bar Rav Huna is Mechayev only if he salted [very heavily,] for a journey [so it will last a long time], not if he salted it [normally] for the house, for then one does not salt so heavily to make food as hard as wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Memachek (scraping the skin) and cutting [it into strips].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Chanina):</span> If one scrapes skin against a pillar (Tosfos; Rashi - he smoothes the ground between pillars), he is liable for Memachek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If one scrapes the ends of poles [to make them smooth and sharp], he is liable for cutting;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one smears a bandage on a wound, he is liable for Memachek;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one smoothes a rock [that was quarried from a mountain], he is liable for Makeh b'Patish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Kisma):</span> If one makes a picture on a Kli or blows glass, he is liable for Makeh b'Patish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one cuts off excess strands from a curtain, he is liable for Makeh b'Patish;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if he is insistent to remove them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Writing two letters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one wrote a big letter in the space needed to write two [normal] letters, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one erased a letter big enough to write two letters in its place, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Menachem b'Rebbi Yosi says, this is a stringency of erasing over writing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Building,...Makeh b'Patish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah and R. Zeira):</span> One who finishes any Melachah is liable for Makeh b'Patish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> These are 39 Melachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>'These' teaches unlike R. Eliezer, who is Mechayev [a second Chatas] for a Toldah done with its Av.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Thirty-nine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>This teaches unlike R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Yehudah also obligates for Shovet (evening the warp threads) and Medakdek (hitting the woof so it will not be too taut);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, Shovet is included in Meisach, and Medakdek is included in weaving.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FOR WHAT ITEMS IS ONE LIABLE FOR <i>HOTZA'AH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Another great general rule of Shabbos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If an item is fitting to store away, if one was Motzi a quantity that people [normally] save, he is Chayav Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If an item is not fitting to save, or if it was less than a Shi'ur that people save, only one who saves it is liable if he was Motzi it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does 'If an item is fitting to store' come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> It excludes Dam Nidah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar Ukva):</span> It excludes wood from an Asherah (it is despised and forbidden to benefit from it, on account of idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Papa excludes Dam Nidah - all the more so he excludes Etzei Asherah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Mar Ukva excludes Etzei Asherah - he would not exclude Dam Nidah, for people save it to feed to a cat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Papa disagrees - since one [whose blood is fed to a cat] becomes weak, people do not save it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Shimon - he says that the Shi'urim are for one who saves them (but one who does not save them is always exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an item is not fitting to save...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Shimon ben Elazar:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> The general rule is - if an item is not fitting to save, or if it is less than people save, and Reuven decided to save it, and Shimon was Motzi it, he is liable on account of Reuven's intent.</p>
