<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW TO EXPLAIN THE MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If one threw something from Reshus ha'Rabim to Reshus ha'Rabim and it passed through Reshus ha'Yachid, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Rebbi is Mechayev two Chata'os (if he was Shogeg), one for Hotza'ah and one for Hachnasah</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(Surely, this is because Kelutah k'Mi she'Hunchah -) - this shows that he does not require Akirah or Hanachah to be from (or on) a place four by four!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No - Rav and Shmuel explained, Rebbi is Mechayev only in a Reshus ha'Yachid with a ceiling over it, he considers it to be filled (with articles, therefore it is as if the thrown object rests on something), but he exempts if there is no ceiling.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps [in our Mishnah] a ceiling covers [the Oni and Ba'al ha'Bayis]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That would explain Akirah and Hanachah in Reshus ha'Yachid, but one would not be liable for transferring to or from such a Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> One who carries four Amos in a Reshus ha'Rabim with a ceiling is exempt, for this is not like Machane Yisrael in the Midbar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(Rav Yosef (Answer #2, 4B 2:g) is rejected.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 2:b, 4B - R. Zeira):</span> Our Mishnah is like Others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Others):</span> If Reuven threw something and Shimon stood still and caught it (in a different Reshus or at least four Amos away in Reshus ha'Rabim), Reuven is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon moved and caught it, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that Others do not require Hanachah on a place four by four!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Perhaps Others do not require four by four for Hanachah, but they require it for Akirah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Perhaps Others require four by four even for Hanachah - the case is, Shimon spread a [four by four] garment to catch it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (to Question 2:b, 4B - R. Aba):</span> The case (in our Mishnah) is, the object was put in on a basket that is four by four.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah says that he put it in the other's hand!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, he put it in a basket in the other's hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This explains Hanachah in Reshus ha'Yachid, but in Reshus ha'Rabim, such a basket is a Reshus ha'Yachid (so why is the Ba'al ha'Bayis Chayav for Hotza'ah?)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> If one inserted a pole in Reshus ha'Rabim with a basket (four by four) on top, and one threw something (from Reshus ha'Rabim) and it landed on the basket, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to R. Yosi, such a basket is Reshus ha'Yachid, the Ba'al ha'Bayis cannot be Chayav for Hotza'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah can be even like R. Yosi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He considers the basket to be Reshus ha'Yachid only if [the top of] it is above 10 Tefachim - in the Mishnah, it is below 10 (and is Batul to Reshus ha'Rabim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (to Answers (j) and (h) - R. Avahu):</span> The Mishnah does not say that he put it in a basket, rather, in the other's hand!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (R. Avahu):</span> The case is, the receiving hand was within three Tefachim of the ground (therefore it is Batul to the ground and is considered to be four by four.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that the Oni is standing outside (surely, his hand is above three!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answers:</span> The case is, he is bending down; alternatively, he is standing in a pit; alternatively, he is a midget.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Did the Tana teach Hotza'ah only in such unusual cases?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Rava, and Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> A person's hand is considered to be four by four.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CATCHING IN THE HAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin citing R. Yochanan):</span> If Reuven threw something and it landed in Shimon's hand, Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Chidush cannot be that a person's hand is considered to be four by four, for R. Yochanan explicitly taught this (he would not teach it again in different words!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, that is the Chidush;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought, a hand is like four by four only when a person specifically intended [to put something in the hand] - here, R. Yochanan teaches that even if he did not care where it lands, the hand is considered four by four.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin citing R. Yochanan):</span> If Shimon stood still and caught it, Reuven is liable; if Shimon moved and caught it, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - Others):</span> If Shimon stood still and caught it, Reuven is liable; if Shimon moved and caught it, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> If Reuven threw an object and ran to catch it, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yochanan unsure about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> He asks about one person who did two distinct actions (that together comprise a Melachah):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If we consider him like one person, he is liable; if we consider him like two, he is exempt [like two who did a Melachah together].</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Chananel):</span> If we consider him like two, he is liable; if we consider him like one, he is exempt (it is as if the Akirah and Hanachah are in the same place). (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS WATER <i>NACH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin citing R. Yochanan):</span> If Shimon put his hand into Reuven's Chatzer (Reshus ha'Yachid), received [falling] rainwater and withdrew his hand (to Reshus ha'Rabim), he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Surely, it makes no difference whether someone else fills Shimon's hand or if Shamayim (falling rain) does - he did not do Akirah, he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Avin means, he gathered rainwater (he hit falling rain, diverting it, and caught it with his other hand).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Akirah was not from a place that is four by four, he should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya brei d'Rav Huna):</span> He gathered rainwater from on top of a wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Such water is not considered to be Nach (at rest, for it would have run off the wall!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the wall is slanted - this is like Rava said elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was reading a Sefer [of rolled up parchment] on a porch (a Karmelis) and it became unraveled (and the other end fell to Reshus ha'Rabim), he may roll it back to himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was on the roof (Reshus ha'Yachid) and it became unraveled:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Before the end comes within 10 Tefachim of the ground, he may roll it back;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Once the end is within 10 Tefachim, he [may not roll it back, this is a decree lest he grab it when it fell totally from his hand, he would be Chayav for this; rather, he) should turn it over so the writing is not seen (lest Kisvei ha'Kodesh be disgraced.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is there a decree? Even if it fell from his hand, he would not be Chayav for retrieving it, for it is not Nach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, the wall is slanted (and we decree, lest it rest on the wall.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rava considers a Sefer on a slanted wall to be Nach, but he would not say so about water, for it runs off!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The case is, he took water from a ditch.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, obviously he is liable, what is the Chidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (He only took some of the water, i.e. on top -) one might have thought that it is not considered to be Nach (for water constantly mixes) - Rava teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rava's answer is like the reasoning behind a question he asked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If a nut is in a vessel floating on water:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we focus on the nut in the vessel, and consider it Munach (at rest?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we focus on the vessel in the water, and say that it is not Munach, for it moves [through the water]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Yochanan ben Nuri and Chachamim argue about oil floating on top of wine:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If (Terumah) oil is floating on top of (Terumah) wine and a Tevul Yom touched the oil, only the oil is Nifsal (for it is not considered connected to the wine);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan ben Nuri says, they are connected (both are Nifsalim).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE IS NOT LIABLE UNTIL HE STOPS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin citing R. Yochanan):</span> If Reuven was laden with food and drink, and went back and forth between Reshus ha'Rabim and Reshus ha'Yachid all day, he is exempt until he stops.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> He is not liable until he stops to rest. (If he stops to adjust the load, this is not considered Hanachah, he is exempt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Abaye's source to say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah taught, if one carried four Amos in Reshus ha'Rabim, but stopped in the middle to rest, he is exempt (this is Hanachah, it ends his Ha'avarah (transport) before he did a Shi'ur to be Chayav);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he stopped to adjust, he is liable (when he finishes);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If after four Amos he stopped to rest, he is liable; if he stopped to adjust, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught the same Chidush (as (a)) in different words!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Safra citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one moved objects from one corner to another, and reconsidered to take them out, he is exempt, since his initial intention was not to take them out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Amora'im argue about which of these R. Yochanan really said.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was Motzi from a store (Reshus ha'Yachid) to the market (a Reshus ha'Rabim) via a Stav (a place of platforms where merchants sit, it is a Karmelis), he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Ben Azai exempts.</p>
