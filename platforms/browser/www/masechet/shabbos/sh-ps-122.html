<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SPECIAL LAWS THAT WERE OBSERVED IN REBBI'S HOUSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> Candlesticks of Rebbi's house may be moved on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Is this only if they can be moved with one hand, or even if they require two hands?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> They are like those of your father's house (Rashi - small, but one fixes a place for big ones; Tosfos - they are large, or are small and have grooves and look like they must be assembled (but small ones without grooves are obviously permitted). Ramban - R. Zeira's father was the king's overseer, it was known that his are big.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> Wagons of Rebbi's house may be moved on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Is this only if one person can move them, or even if they require two people?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> They are like those of your father's house (they require two).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> R. Chanina permitted Rebbi's house to drink wine (R. Chananel - brought) in wagons of Nochrim with one seal [on the barrel].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I do not know if this was because he holds like R. Eliezer (who requires only one seal for wine), or because Nochrim feared Rebbi (the kingdom backed him).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SOMETHING A <i>NOCHRI</i> DID FOR HIMSELF ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri lit a Ner, a Yisrael may use it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he lit it for the Yisrael, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If a Nochri drew water [from a well in Reshus ha'Rabim] for his animals, a Yisrael may use it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he drew for the Yisrael, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If a Nochri made a ramp [to descend from a ship], a Yisrael may descend on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If he made it for the Yisrael, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Once, R. Gamliel and Chachamim were on a ship, and a Nochri made a ramp to descend - R. Gamliel and Chachamim descended on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> We must teach all the clauses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we only taught about a Ner, one might have thought that this is because a Ner for one person is also good for 100, but we forbid regarding water, lest he draw extra for the Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need the clause about the ramp?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is taught in order to bring the episode with R. Gamliel and Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN WE ARE CONCERNED THAT IT WAS DONE FOR A JEW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri gathered grass [for his animals to eat], a Yisrael may let his animals eat it afterwards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he gathered for the Yisrael, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he drew water for his animals, a Yisrael may use it; if he drew for the Yisrael, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is if he does not know the Yisrael - but if he recognizes him, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Huna taught that one may lead his animal to eat from [attached] grass on Shabbos (we are not concerned lest the Yisrael will detach it), but not to eat from Muktzeh (grass detached on Shabbos, lest the Yisrael will give it to the animal - what the Nochri gathered is Muktzeh)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa does not permit the Yisrael to lead his animal there, rather, he stands in front of it [and does not let it go anywhere else] so it goes by itself and eats.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This is if he does not know the Yisrael - but if he recognizes him, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Nochri who made a ramp for R. Gamliel knew him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> R. Gamliel was not there at the time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Even if R. Gamliel was there at the time, it is permitted - a Ner for one person is also good for 100 (the same applies to a ramp. Tosfos - Abaye normally agrees with this - however, because R. Gamliel was so important, if it was made in front of him we would assume that it was made primarily for him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Gamliel):</span> Since he made it when we were not there, we may descend on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, since he made it, we may descend on it. (R. Gamliel happened to mention 'We were not there at the time', but the Heter does not depend on this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye and Rava - Mishnah):</span> If Yisraelim and Nochrim are in a city, and there was a bathhouse open on Shabbos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the majority [of the residents] are Nochrim, one may bathe in the bathhouse immediately [on Motzei Shabbos];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the majority are Yisraelim, one must wait the time needed to heat the water [after Shabbos, even though it was not done in front of Yisraelim, and heating the bath for one heats it for everyone]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The bath is heated for the majority of residents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye and Rava - Beraisa):</span> If a Ner was lit at a party:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the majority are Nochrim, one may use the light;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the majority are Yisraelim, or even half, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There also it is lit for the majority.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">122b----------------------------------------122b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Shmuel visited the house of Avin Torin; a Nochri came and lit a lamp, and Shmuel turned away;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Shmuel saw the Nochri read a document, and realized that he lit it for himself - Shmuel faced the lamp.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK KOL HA'KELIM</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MOVING DOORS OF <i>KELIM</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Kelim may be moved on Shabbos, and their doors may be moved with them, even if the doors came off;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Doors of the house [that came off on Shabbos] are different, for they are not prepared [to be moved].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may take a hammer to break nuts, an axe to break a ring of figs (it is hard and thick), a saw to cut cheese, a shovel to sweep figs, a pitchfork to feed a child, a spindle or Karkar (Kli used to separate threads on a loom) to insert into food [for eating], a hand needle (used to sew garments) to remove a thorn, or a thick needle (used to sew sackcloth, to substitute for a key) to open a door.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> It means, all Kelim may be moved [with their doors], even if the doors came off on Shabbos (some forbid Kelim that broke on Shabbos on account of Nolad), all the more so if they came off on a weekday!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Just the contrary! If they came off on Shabbos, at the start of Shabbos they were Muchanim (prepared for use) as part of the Kelim, but not if they came off before Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Indeed, it means, all Kelim may be moved with their doors; even if the doors came off on a weekday, they may be moved on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may take the door of a chest, box or cupboard, but may not return it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>One may not take nor return the door of a chicken coop.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why the Tana forbids the coop - he holds that since it is attached to the ground, building and destroying apply to it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why does he forbid returning the door of a Kli?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he holds that building applies to Kelim, destroying should also apply (it should also be forbidden to take it); if he holds that destroying does not apply to Kelim, building should not apply either!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> He holds that building and destroying apply to Kelim - the Beraisa means, if the door was removed, one may not return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rava):</span> It says 'One may take'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rava):</span> It says '...but [one may not return]'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He holds that building and destroying do not apply to Kelim - he decrees to forbid returning, lest one will firmly insert it [and be liable for Makeh b'Patish].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>KLI SHE'MELACHTO L'ISUR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may take a hammer [to break nuts].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may take a hammer special for breaking nuts to break nuts, but not a smith's hammer;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He holds that Kli she'Melachto l'Isur (it is used for something forbidden on Shabbos) may not be moved, even if it itself is needed [for something permitted].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah - Seifa):</span> ...A pitchfork to feed a child.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>People do not designate these to feed children!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> The Mishnah permits a smith's hammer to break nuts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>He permits moving Kli she'Melachto l'Isur if it itself is needed.</p>
