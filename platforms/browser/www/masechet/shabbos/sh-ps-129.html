<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Ashi - Rav Yehudah):</span> As long as the womb is open, we Mechalel Shabbos for her, whether or not she says that she needs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After the womb is closed, we do not Mechalel Shabbos for her, even if (Rosh's text - unless) she says that she needs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mar Zutra - Rav Yehudah):</span> As long as the womb is open, we Mechalel Shabbos for her, whether or not she says that she needs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After the womb is closed, we Mechalel Shabbos for her if she says that she needs, not if she says that she does not need (Rosh's text - we Mechalel unless she says that she does not need).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Mar Zutra's version is more lenient than Rav Ashi's - whom does the Halachah follow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mereimar):</span> We follow Mar Zutra's - we are lenient regarding Safek Piku'ach Nefesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From when is the womb open?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It is open from when she sits on the birthing stool.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> It is from when blood exudes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> It is from when she [cannot walk and] needs to be carried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Until when is the womb open?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It is open for three days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It is open for seven days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> It is for 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Neharda'a):</span> The Halachos of a Yoledes depend on whether she is in the first three days, or seven days, or 30 days:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Within three days, we Mechalel Shabbos for her, whether or not she says that she needs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Within seven days, we Mechalel if she says that she needs, but not if she says that she does not need;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Within 30 days, we do not Mechalel for her, but we get a Nochri to do her needs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ula brei d'Rav Ilai):</span> All needs of a Choleh may be done through a Nochri on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> One may tell a Nochri to do something for a Choleh who is not in mortal danger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> For a Yoledes, 30 days (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Chachamim of Neharda'a):</span> She should not immerse before this (the chill could harm her. Seemingly, she should be able to immerse in a heated Mikvah in a heated house, or in summer. A Beraisa (Nidah 29B) discusses a woman immersing many times within 30 days on account of Safek, before she is permitted to have relations - this is not a real proof, perhaps it merely teaches that it <i>would</i> be a Mitzvah to immerse, if not for the danger - <b>PF</b>.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is only if her husband is not with her - if he is there, he will warm her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Chisda's daughter (Rava's wife) immersed before 30 days and got sick - they carried her in her bed to Rava in Pumbadisa.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>RECOVERY AFTER BLOODLETTING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> We may make a bonfire for a Yoledes on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> This is permitted for a Yoledes, not for a Choleh; it is permitted only in winter, not in summer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is permitted for a Yoledes or Choleh; it is permitted in winter and summer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> If someone let blood and got chilled, we may make a bonfire for him, even in summer [on Shabbos].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>They burned a chair of precious wood for Shmuel [after he let blood, for they could not find other wood], a precious table for Rav Yehudah, and a bench for Rabah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Abaye (to Rabah):</span> Isn't this Bal Tashchis (being wasteful)? (Maharsha - if we make a fire on Shabbos for Piku'ach Nefesh, surely it is not Bal Tashchis! Rather, we discuss making a fire on a weekday - he deletes 'and got chilled' from the text of R. Chiya bar Avin's teaching.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> It is preferable not to be wasteful with my health!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One should have shoes, even if he must sell the rafters of his house (Rashi - going barefoot is disgraceful; Maharsha - it is better to suffer heat of the sun than the cold of the ground);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If someone let blood and does not have what to eat, he should sell his shoes to buy the needs of the [post-bloodletting] meal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the needs of this meal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> He must eat meat, to replace the lost blood - meat and blood are both [called] Nefesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> He must drink wine - redness replaces redness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Shmuel would have a dish with a [whole] cooked spleen on the day he had a bloodletting;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Yochanan would drink until the scent of wine would come out of his ears; Rav Nachman would drink until his spleen floated in wine, Rav Yosef would drink until wine left the bloodletting wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Rava would seek to drink wine three years after the grapes were picked and the vine grew three new leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak told his Talmidim, when you let blood, tell your wives that I am coming [so they will prepare a great meal].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>All schemes are forbidden except for one - if someone let blood and cannot afford wine, take a bad coin (which people do not accept) and go to seven wine salesmen and taste the wine before buying it (the seller will cancel the deal when he sees the coin), until tasting a Revi'is in all;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, he should eat seven black dates, rub oil on his temples and sleep in the sun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Avlet (to Shmuel, who was sleeping in the sun):</span> Chacham of the Yehudim! Good will not come from bad (this harms the body)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> I let blood today.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This was not true - rather, there is one day a year when it is good to be in the sun, i.e. the summer (some texts - winter) solstice - Shmuel did not want to reveal this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>GUIDELINES FOR BLOODLETTING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> If one is lenient about eating well after bloodletting, Hash-m will provide less food for him - he is not concerned for himself, why should Hash-m be concerned for him?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> If one let blood, he should not sit in a windy room, lest the doctor left only a Revi'is of blood (the minimum with which one can survive), and a wind will draw some out of him, and he will be in danger!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Shmuel would let blood in a house with [thick] walls of seven and a half layers of bricks (no wind enters).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once, he felt some wind - he found that the wall was a half-brick less thick than it should be.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> If one let blood, he should taste something before leaving [the house] - if not, if he encounters a Mes, his face will turn yellow; if he encounters a murderer, he will die; if he encounters a pig, he is prone to get Tzara'as.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">129b----------------------------------------129b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> If one let blood, he should wait before getting up;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was taught, if one does any of five things and immediately stands up, he is closer to death than life - eating, drinking, sleeping, letting blood, and relations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The proper interval for letting blood is once in 30 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>One should cut down Bein ha'Perakim (after 40 years, only half as often), and cut down again Bein ha'Perakim (after 60 years, only once in three months).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The proper days for bloodletting are Sunday, Wednesday and Friday;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Monday and Thursday are bad, unless he wants to rely on merits of his ancestors, for earthly and Heavenly Batei Din both judge then (Midas haDin is great in the world);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Tuesday bad?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Damaging spiritual forces have more power at times or over things that are even numbers. The five closest planets, sun and moon are called Kochvei Lechet; every hour, one of them dominates (has a supernatural influence on earth), according to a fixed rotation.) On Tuesday, Mars (which is appointed over the sword) is dominant in [the eighth,] an even hour (Rashi - of the daytime, when people normally let blood; R. Chananel - it dominates in two even hours, eight and 22).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also on Friday it is dominant in the sixth (R. Chananel - and 20th) hour(s)! (Tosfos - even though it is dominant in the 12th hour on Wednesday, people do not let blood so close to night.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since many people regularly let blood then, "Shomer Pesa'im Hash-m" (He guards people who do not know to guard themselves).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Wednesday is dangerous if it is the fourth, 14th or 24th of the month, or if it is the last Wednesday of the month.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If one lets blood on Rosh Chodesh or the next day, he is prone to get (extra) weak; on the third of the month, it is dangerous.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Chachamim decreed not to let blood on any Erev Yom Tov on account of Erev Shavu'os, for then blows a wind called Tavu'ach which would have slaughtered everyone had Yisrael not accepted the Torah (and it is dangerous for one who let blood).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Bloodletting after eating wheat only removes the heaviness caused by eating wheat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>It is futile only if he lets blood then to be cured - but if he lets to lighten himself, it is fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>It is good to drink immediately after bloodletting, and to eat after [the time to walk] half a Mil (nine or 11 minutes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one drinks later, is this bad, or just ineffective?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one eats more or less than the given time afterwards, is this bad, or just ineffective?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One should not spend more than one Zuz for 100 gourds or 100 heads of animals (they are not healthy); one should not pay anything for Shefam (the flesh between the mouth and nose) of an animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> In Rav Huna's academy, if Rabanan did not come to learn they would call it 'a day of Shifmi' - I did not understand this [until now].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THINGS ALLOWED ON SHABBOS FOR A BIRTH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may tie the umbilical cord.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may tie the umbilical cord;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, we may even cut and wrap the placenta - this warms the baby;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, princesses wrap it in flasks of oil; rich girls wrap it in [Menupatz] wool, poor girls wrap it in tufts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Chachamim agree that if twins are tied together by their umbilical cords, we cut them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The twins might separate, and it will be dangerous for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Everything said in the Tochachah (Yechezkeil's rebuke of Yisrael, a recount of Hash-m's Chasadim for them) may be done for a birth on Shabbos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"U'Moldosayich b'Yom Huledes" permits taking the fetus out;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Uv'Mayim Lo Ruchatzt l'Mish'i" permits washing the baby (to smooth its skin);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"V'Hamle'ach Lo Humlachat" permits salting (to harden his skin);</p>
