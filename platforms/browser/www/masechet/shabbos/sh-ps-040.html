<p class="dedicationbox">12TH CYCLE SHABBOS 40 (4 Sivan) - Dedicated by Rabbi Kornfeld's father, Mr. David Kornfeld, in memory of the members of his family, Hashem Yikom Damam, who perished at the hands of the Nazi murderers in the Holocaust and whose Yahrzeit is observed today: his mother (Mirel bas Yakov Mordechai), brothers (Shraga Feivel, Aryeh Leib and Yisachar Dov, sons of Mordechai), grandfather (Reb Yakov Mordechai ben Reb David [Shpira]) and aunt (Charne bas Yakov Mordechai [wife of Reb Moshe Aryeh Cohen z'l]). </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW MUCH MAY ONE BATHE ON SHABBOS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav):</span> If water was heated from before Shabbos, one may bathe his whole body in it on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He may wash only his hands, feet and face. (The following questions are against Rav.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> On Shabbos, one may wash his face, hands and feet in water heated from before Shabbos, but not his whole body.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for Rav):</span> It means, he may not wash his whole body at once, only one limb at a time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says, one may wash [only] his face, hands and feet!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for Rav):</span> It means, he may wash his whole body only like face, hands and feet [i.e., only one limb at a time].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #2):</span> If water was heated from before Shabbos, on Shabbos one may wash only his face, hands and feet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for Rav):</span> Also this means, he may wash his whole body only like face, hands and feet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> If water was heated from before Shabbos, on Shabbos one may wash his face, hands and feet, but not his whole body one limb at a time - all the more so regarding water heated on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rabah - (Rav):</span> If water was heated from before Shabbos, on Shabbos one may bathe his whole body in it, except for one limb.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The same questions were asked against Rav - he was refuted (the answer given above on his behalf does not apply).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef of Abaye):</span> Did Rabah conduct according to what he said in the name of Rav?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, Rabah did not, for Rav was refuted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps he (Rabah - alternatively, Rav Yosef) did not hear the Beraisa that refutes him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he did not hear the Beraisa, surely he followed Rav's teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Wherever Rav and Shmuel argue, Rabah always followed Rav, except for three Halachos in which he followed Shmuel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may remove Tzitzis from a garment to attach them to another garment, one may light a Ner Chanukah from another Ner Chanukah, the Halachah follows R. Shimon regarding dragging [a bed, chair or bench on a dirt floor, as long as he does not intend to make a furrow].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Rabah always followed the stringencies of Rav, he did not follow all of his leniencies.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DECREES AGAINST BATHING ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the holes of a bathhouse were plugged up from before Shabbos [to store the heat; alternatively, so the fire will not heat the water on Shabbos], one may bathe in it on Motzei Shabbos immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the holes were plugged up from before Yom Tov, one may Mezi'a (take a steambath) in it on Yom Tov and shower in the outer room.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> A case occurred in Benei Berak, the holes were plugged up from before Yom Tov, R. Elazar ben Azaryah and R. Akiva were Mezi'a in it on Yom Tov and showered in the outer room - however, the hot water was covered with boards (Rashi - ensuring that the water was not heated on Yom Tov; Tosfos- so people would not suspect that they bathed in hot water).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> It is permitted even if the hot water was not covered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>After many people transgressed, Chachamim began to forbid [bathing] - but one may walk through a city bathhouse [without intent to sweat].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did the transgressors do?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> At first, people bathed on Shabbos in water heated from Erev Shabbos; bathhouse attendants started to heat water on Shabbos (Ran, based on Yerushalmi - they were Meshaheh water to get hot on Shabbos - Yisraelim are not suspected of transgressing Shabbos mid'Oraisa) and say that it was hot from before Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim forbade [bathing], but still permitted Zei'ah. People would bathe in hot water and claim that they were Mezi'a - Chachamim decreed to forbid Zei'ah, but still allowed hot springs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>People would bathe in hot water and claim that they bathed in hot springs - Chachamim forbade hot springs, but still allowed bathing in cold water;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Chachamim saw that people could not abide by the decree against hot springs - they permitted hot springs, but Zei'ah remains forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one transgresses mid'Rabanan laws, others may call him a transgressor. (Me'iri - it is a Mitzvah to debase him, do deter others from transgressing.).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">40b----------------------------------------40b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This is like this Tana (he calls people who violated the decrees 'transgressors').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may walk through a city bathhouse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Bathhouses of cities are permitted, those of villages are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since they are small, they get very hot (he will Mezi'a).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> [On Shabbos] one may heat himself in front of a fire and shower in cold water, one may not shower in cold water and then heat himself in front of a fire, for this makes the water lukewarm (and it is forbidden to wash [Rosh - even part of; Rambam - all of] the body in water heated on Shabbos; Tosfos ha'Rosh - the Yerushalmi forbids on account of cooking the water).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>One may heat a towel and put it on an aching stomach;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>One may not put a kettle of hot water on the [Tosfos - towel on the] stomach [lest water drip out, causing him to wash in water heated on Shabbos (or he may come to squeeze water from the towel); Tosfos - this looks like a cure, which is forbidden on Shabbos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is forbidden even on a weekday on account of danger (lest he burn the stomach).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HEATING OIL ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> [On Shabbos] one may leave a kettle of water in front of a fire, not long enough to (Rashi; Rif - not in a place where it could) get hot, only to blunt its chill.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, a woman may leave a flask of oil in front of a fire, not to get cooked, only to get warm;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, she may anoint her hand with oil, heat it in front of a fire and anoint her son (a minor) without any concern.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the first Tana's opinion about oil?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> He permits [Rashi - heating it to Yad Soledes Bo (so hot that it makes one withdraw his hand); Rashba - to put it where it could become Yad Soledes Bo];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> He forbids this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah and Rav Yosef say that he permits even Yad Soledes Bo - he holds that cooking does not apply to oil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says that cooking applies to oil, but warming it is not cooking it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says that cooking applies to oil, and warming it is cooking it (therefore it may be warmed only through a Shinuy, e.g. on the hand)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rav Nachman says that the first Tana forbids even below Yad Soledes Bo - he holds that cooking applies to oil, and warming it is cooking it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yehudah says that cooking applies to oil, but warming it is not cooking it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says that cooking applies to oil, and warming it is cooking it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon does not argue with the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon permits through a Shinuy, the first Tana does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The law is the same for water and oil - Yad Soledes Bo is forbidden, less than this is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How hot is Yad Soledes Bo? (Rashi - it is different for different people; Me'iri - when she puts her anointed hand near the fire, how can she gauge if the oil would make her hand recoil?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rachbah):</span> It is hot enough to scald a baby's stomach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> I once went to bathe in back of Rebbi; I wanted to warm oil in the water and anoint him with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Put the [flask of] oil in water in a Kli Sheni (do not heat it in the bath, it is like a Kli Rishon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>We learn three things from this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Cooking applies to oil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Kli Sheni does not cook;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Warming oil is (our text, Rashi; Rashba - is not) cooking it. (Rashi - this is why he did not allow in a Kli Rishon; Rashba's text - this is why he allowed warming it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could Rebbi say this in the bath - Rabah bar bar Chanah taught that one may think about Torah anywhere (Me'iri - even if is he is unsure if the place is clean) except for a bathhouse or bathroom [even if it is clean]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is forbidden only in Lashon ha'Kodesh (and he said this in another language).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Abaye taught that secular matters may be said even in Lashon ha'Kodesh, Torah is forbidden in any language!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One may stop someone from transgressing [even if this implicitly teaches Halachos].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that a Talmid followed R. Meir into a bathhouse and wanted to wash the floor and apply scented water to it - R. Meir said that these are forbidden [lest one even out holes in a dirt floor].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>This shows that the Isur does not apply to preventing transgression. (Ritva - this is a clearer proof than the case of Rebbi, for R. Meir explicitly said that they are forbidden; Maharshal - one might have thought that Rebbi requested a Kli Sheni because he did not want the oil to be so hot.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> We learn that one who cooks in hot spring water on Shabbos is liable - the episode with Rebbi was after the decree (against bathing in hot water, we must say that it was in hot spring water), and he told R. Yitzchak to put the oil in a Kli Sheni!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Chisda taught that one who cooks in hot spring water on Shabbos is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ravina meant, he is lashed mid'Rabanan.</p>
