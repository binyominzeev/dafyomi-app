<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE HONOR OF GARMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "V'Sachas Kevodo Yekad Yekod ki'Kod Esh" - [the bodies of Sancheriv's army, which are] under their Kavod (garments) were burned - their garments themselves were not burned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan does not explain Kavod literally (their bodies) - he calls his garments Machbedosai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Tachas (in place of) their actual Kavod (bodies, which were burned, will be ashes);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> [Their Neshamos, which are] under their Kavod (bodies) were burned (but not their bodies), like the death of Nadav and Avihu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like there, the Neshamos were burned and the bodies were intact, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha):</span> What is the source that changing garments shows honor to Hash-m?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "U'Foshat Es Begdav v'Lovash Begadim Acherim" (inferior garments are used to take ashes from the Mizbe'ach outside);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'vei R. Yishmael):</span> The Torah teaches proper conduct - one should not mix a cup for his master in the same garments he wore while cooking food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It is disgraceful for a Chacham to go out with patched shoes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Acha bar Chanina went out with patched shoes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Nachman):</span> It is disgraceful only if there is a patch on top of a patch.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If Revav (Rashi - a stain of fat; Rif - of wax or pitch) is found on a Chacham's garment, he is Chayav Misah [bi'Dei Shomayim] - "Kol Mesan'ai Ohavu Maves" - we read this 'Masni'ai' (those who make people hate 'me' (Torah)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (Ravina):</span> This applies to Revad (a stain of semen).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They do not argue - one is liable for Revav only on the outermost garment, one is liable for semen even on an inner garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Ran - (Ravina):</span> This applies to Revad (dry blood, people will suspect that he had relations with a Nidah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They do not argue - one is liable for blood only on the outermost garment, but on an inner garment people will attribute it to a louse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 - Tosfos Avodah Zarah 33a - (Ravina):</span> This is called Revad. (end of Version #3)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> What do we learn from "Ka'Asher Holach Avdi Yeshayahu Arum v'Yachef [Shalosh Shanim]"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was naked, i.e. in worn out garments; he was barefoot, i.e. in patched shoes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Revav on a [donkey] saddle is a Chatzitzah [regarding immersion];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, the Shi'ur to be Chotzetz is an Italian Isar (a coin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Revav on both sides of a garment is a Chatzitzah, on one side it is not a Chatzitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>R. Yehudah says, even from one side it is Chotzetz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> On a saddle, is it a Chatzitzah only from both sides, or even from one side?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> I did not hear about this, but we can learn from a related law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> A stain on a garment of Bana'im (this will be explained) from one side is Chotzetz, on a boor's garment it is Chotzetz only if it is on both sides.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A saddle should not be more prestigious than a boor's garment (on one side it is not Chotzetz)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CHACHAMIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are the Bana'im mentioned in the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> They are Chachamim, who engage in building the world all their days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> Which Chacham is believed to say that he recognizes that a lost object is his [even though he cannot give a sign]?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is one who is particular about his garment, that if he put it on inside-out he reverses it (Rashi; Maharsha - he is concerned for a stain even from one side, even if it will not show (therefore a stain on one side is Chotzetz). Shulchan Aruch also requires that he never lies, with only three exceptions, based on Bava Metzi'a 24A.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> Which Chacham is qualified to be appointed over the Tzibur?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> He must know everything so well that he can answer questions on it, even 'Kalah' (a minor tractate, it can be found after Maseches Avodah Zarah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer:</span> He must know <i>something</i> so well that he can answer questions on it, even 'Kalah' (laws of the festival that are learned 30 days beforehand, most people are familiar with it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> For which Chacham must residents of the city do his work?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is one who abandons his business and engages [only] in spiritual matters.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>He must know something so well that he can answer questions on it, even 'Kalah'.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This refers only to things like digging, i.e. essentials that he cannot do himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A Chacham is one who can answer a question about any Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the application of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is to be appointed over the Tzibur - if he knows one Maseches, he can be appointed where they are learning that Maseches; if he knows everything, he can be appointed Rosh Yeshivah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> Bana'im are bathhouse attendants, they have Ulyarim (special towels for important people).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> [Since a small stain is a Chatzitzah,] this implies that Ulyarim are white (people are not concerned for small stains on colored clothing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yanai told his children 'Do not bury me in black clothing - perhaps I will merit to be in Gan Eden, I will look like a mourner among Chasanim (people rejoicing);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, do not bury me in white clothing - perhaps I will be in Gehinom, I will be like a Chasan among mourners!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, bury me in Ulyarin garments of overseas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Outer Ulyarin garments are red, inner Ulyarin garments are white.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS SHABBOS MORE KODESH THAN YOM KIPUR?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> One may fold...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "Olas Shabas b'Shabato" (we expound as if it says 'b'Shabas'), Chelev of [Korbanos of] Shabbos may be offered on [another Shabbos, i.e.] Yom Kipur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva says, it teaches that Chelev of Shabbos may be offered on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it may be offered even on Yom Kipur!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "B'Shabat<i>o</i>" excludes this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yishmael holds that we may bring Nedarim and Nedavos on Yom Tov - we do not need a verse to permit Chelev of Shabbos on Yom Tov, therefore it teaches about Yom Kipur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva holds that we may bring Nedarim and Nedavos on Yom Tov, so we need the verse to permit Chelev of Shabbos on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">114b----------------------------------------114b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When Yom Kipur is on Erev Shabbos, they do not Toke'a (blow the Shofar at the beginning of Shabbos (35B) - Teki'ah shows that the coming day is more Kodesh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Yom Kipur is on Motzei Shabbos, we do not say Havdalah [in Shemoneh Esre - Havdalah shows that the day that ended was more Kodesh].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> In Bavel, we used to say that all agree to this Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Eretz Yisrael, Yehudah the son of R. Shimon ben Pazi said that it is like R. Akiva - but R. Yishmael would say that we Toke'a (when Shabbos follows Yom Kipur; R. Chananel - when Yom Kipur follows Shabbos), to publicize that [Shabbos is more Kodesh, i.e.] we may offer Chelev of Shabbos on Yom Kipur</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>I told him that Kohanim are zealous (they already know this; we need not Toke'a for them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Kashisha brei d'Rav Chisda):</span> We do not say that Kohanim are zealous!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [The Teki'os in the Mikdash on Erev Shabbos include] three to cease people from Melachah, and three to separate Kodesh from profane.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Elsewhere, Abaye answered, they are for others (not Kohanim) in Yerushalayim - here also, they are for others in Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [According to everyone] we should Toke'a to publicize that Kenivas Yerek (Rashi - cutting vegetables; Ran - rinsing them) is permitted on Yom Kipur from the time of Minchah [to be eaten at night, on account of Inuy (Rashi - he deals with food but may not eat it, increasing anguish; Ba'al ha'Ma'or - to lessen his anguish that he will not have food ready to break his fast after dark) - this is forbidden on Shabbos]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> We do not override Shevus (the Isur mid'Rabanan of Teki'ah) to publicize that something is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> We override Shevus only for something that applies right away, but not for Kenivas Yerek (R. Chananel - it is not permitted until Minchah; Rashi - the suggestion was to Toke'a when Shabbos begins on Motzei Yom Kipur, to teach about future years).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We do not always override Shevus for something that applies right away!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When Yom Tov is on Motzei Shabbos, they do not Toke'a, we say Havdalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Rav Shisha, we should Toke'a to publicize that one may slaughter immediately!</p>
