<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WEARING RINGS AND NEEDLES ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Mishnah #1 discusses two different cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A ring with a stamp is a Tachshit for a man, a ring without a stamp is a Tachshit for a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The laws of Tum'ah and [carrying on] Shabbos are different!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tum'ah depends on "Kli Ma'aseh" - in either case it is a Kli;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shabbos depends on whether or not it is a load - if it has a stamp, it is considered a load [for a woman]; if not, it is a Tachshit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...Or a needle without a hole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does a woman wear such a needle [even during the week]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> She wraps around it hairs sticking out from her braids [and inserts it under the headdress (Rashi; Tosfos - she uses it to hold down the headdress, so hair will not go out).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> If so, it should be like a garter belt [to hold up socks], which is Tahor (i.e. not a Tachshit) and permitted (Rashi - it is immodest to remove it; Tosfos - the decree against Tachshitim on Shabbos should not apply)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ada Narsha'ah):</span> She uses it to part her hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does she use it for on Shabbos? (Rashi - one may not part hair on Shabbos; Tosfos - it is not a Tachshit nor a garment, it should be a load!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It has a gold plate at the other end - on a weekday she parts her hair with the needle, on Shabbos she wears the plate on her forehead.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DECREE AGAINST WEARING NAILED SANDALS ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not go out [on Shabbos] with nailed [wooden] sandals, nor with [only] one sandal, unless he has a wound on his foot;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may not go out with Tefilin, a Kemi'a that is not from a Mumcheh, armor, a helmet or iron boots;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one went out with any of these, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is a nailed sandal forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> Yisraelim were hiding in a cave on account of a royal decree; people were allowed to enter (for one may see that no one is looking at the time), but not to leave (lest the kingdom will see where they are hiding);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(A nailed sandal can be worn reversed.) Someone had entered wearing a reversed nailed sandal, his footprints (seemingly) indicated that someone had left - everyone was panicking, expecting the enemy to attack. They pushed and shoved each other, this killed more people than the enemy killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Ila'i ben Elazar):</span> They were in a cave [on account of a decree]; they heard sounds [of nailed sandals] above the cave. They panicked; more people were killed by the pushing and shoving than by the enemy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rami bar Yechezkeil):</span> They were in a synagogue; they heard voices outside; they panicked, pushing and shoving; more people were killed by their nailed sandals (which are thick at the front) than by the enemy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>[According to all three answers,] at this time, it was decreed not to wear a nailed sandal on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should be forbidden even during the week!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The episode occurred on Shabbos, so only Shabbos was forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why is it forbidden on Yom Tov?!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may send garments to a friend on Yom Tov, whether or not they are sewn [as long as they can be used on a weekday], but not a nailed sandal or a sandal that was not sewn. (This is a special stringency of a nailed sandal - even though it is usable on weekdays, one may not even send it on Yom Tov, lest one come to wear it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shabbos was forbidden, for it is a day when everyone gathers [in synagogues and Batei Medrash, like the episode] - the same applies to Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">\Question:</span> If so, also fast days should be forbidden, for everyone gathers then!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They forbade only days when everyone gathers and it is forbidden to do Melachah, like the episode - Melachah is permitted on fast days (R. Akiva Eiger - at night, in any case - Ta'anis 12B);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(A case occurred, ashes of the Parah Adumah were being taken across the Yarden in a boat; Tum'as Mes was found in the bottom of the boat, the ashes became Tamei and hence disqualified. Chachamim decreed not to take the ashes across a river, not in a boat or over a bridge or to swim across with them, not across the Yarden or any other river.) Even R. Chanina ben Akiva, who says that the decree was only not to take them across the Yarden in a boat, could agree here [that Yom Tov is also forbidden];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He holds that they did not decree about other rivers, for the [depth or width of the] Yarden is unlike other rivers - but Yom Tov is just like Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only difference between [what is forbidden on] Shabbos and Yom Tov is Melachah done to prepare food.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW MANY NAILS FORBID A SANDAL?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A sandal is considered nailed only if the nails are to keep it together - if they are for decoration, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How many nails are allowed [for decoration]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> Five nails are allowed on each sandal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina):</span> Seven are allowed on each.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> I allow five - two on the inside (facing the other sandal, i.e.) one by the toes and one by the sole, two on the outside (one by the toes, one by the sole), and one on the strap;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Chanina allows seven - three on the inside, three on the outside, and one on the strap.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1 - R. Noson):</span> If a sandal is uneven (one side is thicker than the other), one may insert seven nails [and it is still not considered a nailed sandal];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi permits 13 nails.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Chanina is like R. Noson - but R. Yochanan is not like either Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan holds like R. Nehurai:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Nehurai):</span> Five nails are permitted, seven are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Eifah (a Chacham, to Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> You Talmidim of R. Yochanan must follow his opinion - we follow R. Chanina's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna):</span> Are five permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Even seven are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna):</span> Are nine permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Even eight are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>NAILED SANDALS THAT WERE NOT FORBIDDEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (a shoemaker):</span> If a [leather] lining was sewn into a nailed sandal, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> [R. Yochanan taught that] it is permitted, but I do not know why.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Surely, you know - it is considered a shoe on account of the lining, the decree was only regarding a sandal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba bar Zavda):</span> If he fastened it with nails bent in a semicircle, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba bar Avina):</span> It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina also permitted this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> If one inserted nails sticking out underneath the sole so it will not get worn out, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa #3):</span> One may not go out with a nailed shoe, even from house to house, even from bed to bed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may use it to cover a Kli or to support legs of a bed (for it is a Kli);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon forbids (lest one will come to wear it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If most of the nails fell out and four or five remained, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rebbi permits until seven remain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If it was covered with leather on bottom and they were fastened with nails from above, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>If he made the heads of the nails wide or very pointy, or covered the entire bottom with nails so it will not wear out, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> 'If most of the nails fell out' implies that any minority is permitted, even if many remain - but then it says that only four or five are permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">\Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> If the tops of the nails fell out but it is evident that more used to be there, any minority is permitted (one can see that it changed);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>If the nails were totally uprooted and there is no trace that more used to be there, only four or five are permitted. (Some permit any minority in this case, but only four or five when the tops fell out.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3):</span> Four or five are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It suffices to permit five, all the more so four are permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> Four are permitted in a small sandal, five in a large sandal.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>HOW MANY NAILS ARE PERMITTED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3 - Rebbi):</span> It is permitted until seven remain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #1):</span> Rebbi permits 13 nails.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #1 discusses an uneven sandal, it is different (its nails are to make it even).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Masnah):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious, the Halachah is not like an individual against the majority!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Halachah follows him because his reasoning is sound - Rav Masnah teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> If they didn't call me 'The Babylonian that permits', I would permit even more!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How many [nails] does he permit?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Pumbadisa):</span> He permits 24.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chachamim of Sura):</span> He permits 22.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> A way to remember the opinions - on the way from Pumbadisa to Sura, Chaser (were lost - this sounds like Sura) two [nails].</p>
