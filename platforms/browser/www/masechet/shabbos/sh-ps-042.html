<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Shmuel holds like R. Shimon (who permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Shmuel holds that we may extinguish (on Shabbos) a metal coal in Reshus ha'Rabim, in order that people will not be harmed (normally, this is forbidden mid'Rabanan), but not a coal of wood (for this is forbidden mid'Oraisa);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he held like R. Shimon, he should permit extinguishing even a wooden coal (this is Melachah she'Einah Tzerichah l'Gufah, it is forbidden only mid'Rabanan)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like R. Shimon regarding Davar she'Eino Miskaven, but he is Mechayev for Melachah she'Einah Tzerichah l'Gufah like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Shmuel teaches that Isurim mid'Rabanan are permitted to prevent damage to the public - therefore, if a thorn is in Reshus ha'Rabim, one may carry it less than four Amos at a time [to the side of Reshus ha'Rabim];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is in a Karmelis, one may carry it [to where people do not walk] without stopping.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MIXING HOT AND COLD WATER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> But one may put...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> One may pour hot water into cold water, but not vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Hillel permit both of these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This refers to a cup (a Kli Sheni used for drinking, people do not make it so hot);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, in a bath (Tosfos - a Kli Sheni; alternatively, a Kli Rishon - Tosfos ha'Rosh), one may put only hot into cold [for people make it very hot].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon ben Menasiyah forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> A bucket (used for bathing) is like a bath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye - R. Chiya's Beraisa):</span> A bucket is not like a bath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could Rav Yosef have thought that a bucket is like a bath - Rav Nachman taught that the Halachah follows R. Shimon [ben Menasiyah, who forbids mixing bath water in every case] - it there no way to bathe in hot water on Shabbos?! (Water on the fire is too hot, one must mix it with cold water; it is unfeasible to wait until it cools down.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Tosfos - Rav Yosef thought that] R. Shimon does not discuss the Seifa (a bath), rather, the Reisha - Beis Hillel permit hot into cold and cold into hot;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon forbids [cold into hot].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Shimon hold like Beis Shamai?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he says that there is no argument about this (all forbid cold into hot).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> I saw that Rava was not particular about the Kli (Rishon or Sheni) - he relied on R. Chiya's Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> One may put a flask of water into a bucket, whether hot into cold or vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna):</span> Perhaps this is permitted only because a Kli separates the hot and cold water!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The Beraisa permits <i>pouring</i> a flask of water into a bucket, whether hot into cold or vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT COOKS SALT AND SPICES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one removed a frying pan or pot from the fire, one may not put spices into it [on Shabbos]; (R. Akiva Eiger - Rashi suggests that Bein ha'Shemashos this is permitted - perhaps he holds [like Tosfos] that cooking spices is not forbidden mid'Oraisa, and our Mishnah is like Rebbi, who permits Shevus (Rabbinic decrees of Shabbos) Bein ha'Shemashos.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may put spices into a bowl (a Kli Sheni).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, one may put [spices] into any [food], except for one with vinegar or brine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does R. Yehudah discuss?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps he discusses the Reisha (putting spices in a Kli Rishon off the fire, compared to the first Tana), he is lenient;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Perhaps he discusses the Seifa (putting in a Kli Sheni), he is stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> One may put [spices] into any simmering pot or pan, except for one with vinegar or brine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Salt is like spices, [according to the first Tana] it is cooked only in a Kli Rishon, not in a Kli Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Objection (Abaye - R. Chiya's Beraisa):</span> Salt is unlike spices, it is cooked even in a Kli Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Beraisa also argues with Rav Nachman:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Salt needs much cooking, like ox meat (it gets cooked only in a Kli Rishon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Objection (Abaye - R. Chiya's Beraisa):</span> Salt is unlike spices, it is not cooked even in a Kli Rishon [off the fire].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This supports Rav Nachman:</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FOR WHAT WE MAY MOVE A KLI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not put a Kli under a Ner to catch dripping oil;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one put a Kli there from before Shabbos, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not benefit from the oil, for it is nor prepared [for use on Shabbos, it is Muktzeh].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Chisda):</span> Even though it was taught that one may not put a Kli under a hen to catch an egg it will lay (e.g. it is about to lay an egg on an incline, it is prone to roll and break), one may put a Kli over an egg to prevent it from getting broken.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> He holds that hens often lay eggs in wasteheaps (where they are in danger of getting broken), they rarely lay eggs on inclines;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Chachamim permitted moving a Kli to save [something Muktzeh, like an egg laid on Shabbos] in a common case, not in an unusual case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> Chachamim permitted exertion to prevent a loss in a common case, not in an unusual case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If a barrel [of Tevel - Tosfos deletes this from the text] broke on the roof, one may bring a Kli underneath it [to catch the contents].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses a new barrel [it is prone to break].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Mishnah):</span> One may put a Kli under a Ner to catch sparks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Ner often emits sparks.</p>
