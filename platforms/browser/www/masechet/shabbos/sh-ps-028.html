<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS MEKABEL TUM'AS OHALIM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Nothing from a tree is Mekabel Tum'as Ohalim (i.e. when it is an Ohel over Tum'as Mes, it becomes Tamei), except for linen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Ohel-Ohel" from the Mishkan (the bottom curtains, made of wool and linen);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Adam Ki Yamus b'Ohel", and it says "Va'Yifros Es ha'Ohel Al ha'Mishkan" - just like the latter Ohel had nothing from a tree except for linen, also the first verse does not apply to anything from a tree other than linen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like the latter Ohel was twined and each thread was six-fold, also the first verse applies only to such an Ohel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ohel" is repeated [in the Parshah of Tum'as Mes] to include an Ohel without these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should include an Ohel from any material!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn to, for then the Gezerah Shavah would not teach anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say, just like in the Mishkan there were beams with the linen, also Tum'as Ohalim is only when there are beams with the linen (Tosfos; Rashi - we should say that beams are also Mekabel Tum'as Ohalim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Asisa Es ha'Kerashim la'Mishkan" - the beams are <i>for</i> the Mishkan, they themselves are not called Mishkan (Ohel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (On top of the bottom curtains of wool and linen were curtains of goat's hair, and on top of them one or two curtains of skins of rams and Tachashim, as we will explain.) If so, we should expound "V'Asisa Michseh la'Ohel" - the covering [of ram and /or Tachash skins] is for the Ohel (of goat curtains), they themselves are not called Ohel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But R. Elazar asked whether or not skin of a Tamei animal is Mekabel Tum'as Ohalim - if even [the Michseh, made of] skin of Tahor animals is not Mekabel Tum'as Ohalim, all the more so skin of Teme'im is not! (Our only source for Tum'as Ohalim is the Mishkan - if the Tachashim were Tehorim, no Tamei skins were in the Mishkan!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Another verse teaches that they are called Ohel - "V'Es Ohel Mo'ed Michsehu u'Michse ha'Tachash Asher Alav" - the upper covering is equated to the lower one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the lower covering (of goat curtains) is called Ohel, also the upper covering [of skins over it].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SKIN OF AN ANIMAL THAT IS <i>TAMEI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> Is skin of a Tamei animal Mekabel Tum'as Ohalim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he ask (Tum'as Ohalim applies only materials used for an Ohel in the Mishkan, only Tahor animals were used)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> He asks whether or not the Tachash in the days of Moshe was Tahor or Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> He should know this from a Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Only skin of Tahor animals is Kosher for Meleches Shamayim (i.e. the Mishkan).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Aba - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> There were two covers [over the goat curtains], one of [skin of] red rams, one of Tachashim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Nechemyah says, there was one covering (half of ram skins, half of Tachash skins), it was like a squirrel.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>A squirrel is Tamei! (R. Nechemyah argues with Rav Yosef's Beraisa, therefore it is reasonable that R. Elazar was unsure!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [R. Nechemyah means,] it was multicolored like a squirrel, but it was Tahor, unlike a squirrel, which is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Yosef):</span> The Targum (translation) of Tachash is Sasgona - it Sas (rejoices) over its many Gavanim (colors).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> (We learn Tum'as Ohel from Tzara'as.) A Beraisa teaches that skin of a Tamei animal is Mekabel Tum'as Tzara'as:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Regarding Tzara'as it says] "O <i>b</i>'Or" to include skin of a Tamei animal, or a garment that developed a Nega while the Kohen was looking at it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include a garment made of pieces of all of the materials [mentioned in the verse]?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "O b'Chol Meleches Or" includes this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from Tzara'as, even Shesi or Erev (threads) are Teme'im (even though they are not Mekabel other Tum'os).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from [Tum'as] Sheratzim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "Or" - perhaps only skin of Tahor animals is Mekabel Tum'ah (from a Sheretz) - what is the source to include skin of a Tamei animal?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "O Or".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from Tum'as Sheretz, even k'Adashah (the size of a lentil) is Tamei (but Tum'as Mes requires a k'Zayis)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tzara'as Yochi'ach (shows that this is not the determining factor) - we learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Each has its own stringency; the Tzad ha'Shavah (common side) of them is that skin is Mekabel Tum'ah, even skin of a Tamei animal - the same applies to Tum'as Ohalim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava of Barnish):</span> We cannot learn from them, neither requires a k'Zayis for Tum'ah, unlike Tum'as Mes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava of Barnish):</span> We learn from a Kal va'Chomer from goats' hair - it is not Mekabel Tum'as Tzara'as, yet it is Mekabel Tum'as Ohalim - skin of a Tamei animal is Mekabel Tum'as Tzara'as, all the more so it is Mekabel Tum'as Ohalim!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yosef's Beraisa taught that only skin of Tahor animals is Kosher for Meleches Shamayim - if this does not Metaher skin of a Tamei animal from Tum'as Ohalim, what does it teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Posel skin of a Tamei animal for Tefilin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A verse explicitly teaches that!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lema'an Tihyeh Toras Hash-m <i>b'Ficha</i>" - Tefilin must be made from something permitted to your mouth, i.e. skin of a Tahor animal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> [The verse only discusses the parchments, on which Divrei <i>Torah</i> are written -] the Beraisa is Posel Teme'im for the boxes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Abaye taught that a tradition from Moshe from Sinai mandates that [head] Tefilin have [a protrusion on the box shaped like] a Shin (it is part of 'Shakai', a name of Hash-m, so the verse also teaches about the boxes)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it teaches that hair [and sinews] of Teme'im may not be used to wrap the parchments [and sew the boxes].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also this we know from tradition</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A tradition from Sinai teaches that Tefilin must be square, and [the parchments must be] wrapped with 'their' hair (i.e. of animals Kosher for parchments), and [the boxes must be] sewn with 'their' sinews!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, it is Posel Teme'im for the straps.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yitzchak taught that a tradition from Sinai requires the straps to be black! (Tosfos - if the Torah mandates what color they must be, all the more so it mandates that they be from a Tahor animal, just like the boxes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The tradition requires them to be black, it does not require them to be from Tahor animals [nor can we learn from a Kal va'Chomer]. (On 62A, it says that a tradition from Sinai requires the straps to form a Dalet and Yud to complete 'Shakai'; Tosfos deletes this from the text, for our Gemara finds no source to require straps from Tahor animals other than the Beraisa. Rashba defends the text - since these letters are not written, merely formed, this would not mandate being from Tehorim.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE <i>TACHASH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion about the Tachash in the days of Moshe?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ila'a):</span> It was a species unto itself; Chachamim did not determine if it is a Chayah or Behemah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It had a horn on its forehead, it existed only at that time, for the sake of the Mishkan, afterwards it was hidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Since it had a horn, it must be Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The ox that Adam offered had one horn on its forehead - "V'Sitav la'Shem...Makrin".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Makrin" is plural (suggesting at least two)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is written missing the 'Yud', suggesting the singular (mi'Keren).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since it had a horn, it must be a Behemah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Keresh (giraffe) has a horn, it is a Chayah - perhaps also the Tachash was a Chayah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A WICK MADE FROM A GARMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If one twined a garment to make a wick but did not singe it, [if it is three fingers by three fingers] it is Tamei, one may not light with it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Akiva says, it is Tahor, one may light with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We understand the argument regarding Tum'ah - R. Eliezer holds that twining does not Mevatel it from being a garment, R. Akiva holds that it does;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the argument regarding lighting?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The case is, the garment was exactly three by three, Erev Shabbos was Yom Tov;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Both hold like R. Yehudah, who says that we may light with a Kli, but not with a Kli that broke [on Yom Tov, for it is Nolad];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Both hold like Ula, who says that [before removing his hand] one must light the majority of the Yotzei (the part of the wick outside of the Ner);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Eliezer holds, the wick is still considered a garment - once a bit burns, it is a broken Kli, it is forbidden to continue to light the majority of the Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Akiva holds, the garment was Batul was it was folded, it is like a piece of wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I had heard that a Mishnah discusses exactly three by three - I did not understand this until now.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, Rav Ada explains that all hold like R. Yehudah because he holds like him - but this is not so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> A Yisrael may burn his log on Yom Tov, even if a Nochri carved out a [cavity holding a] Kav in it [that same day].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> This is Nolad (firewood became a Kli)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Rav Ada explains that R. Eliezer and R. Akiva hold like R. Yehudah, but he himself does not.</p>
