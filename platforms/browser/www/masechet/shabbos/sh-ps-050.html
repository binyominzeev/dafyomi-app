<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DESIGNATION FOR PERMITTED USES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Hatmanah is permitted in wool shearings, one may not move them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one was not Matmin in them, they may not be moved - if they were used for Hatmanah, they may be moved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (a new Talmid - Mishnah):</span> Hatmanah is permitted in wool shearings, one may not move them - how may one take the food? One lifts the cover, the wool falls (but one may not directly move the wool)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rava really said, the Mishnah discusses when one did not designate the wool for Hatmanah - if he designated it, it may be moved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Ravin citing Rebbi):</span> The Mishnah discusses when one did not designate the wool for Hatmanah - if he designated it, it may be moved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> The Mishnah discusses wool stored to be sold (Rava discusses regular wool).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One may not move wool stored to be sold; if the owner prepared it for use, it may be moved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah - Beraisa #1):</span> If one cut Chariyos (hard, leafless Lulav branches) for the sake of [fire]wood, and then decided to use them to sit on, he must tie them (to show that they will be used for sitting - if not they are Muktzeh);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he need not tie them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> He must tie them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It suffices to intend to sit on them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> It suffices to sit on them [before Shabbos], even if he did not tie them or intend to sit on them [on Shabbos].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand Rav - he holds like the first Tana; we understand Shmuel - he holds like R. Shimon ben Gamliel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But Rav Asi is not like either Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may go out with combed flax or unraveled wool on a wound (Rashi; Rav Hai Gaon - a toupee), if it was dyed [Rashi's text - with oil] and tied on with a string - if it was not dyed or tied, one may not go out with [or even move] it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one went out with it before Shabbos, even if it was not dyed or tied, one may go out with it on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Asi - Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> One may not use his hand to move straw on a bed, but he may move it with his body;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the straw was food for animals, or if a sheet or blanket was spread over it (Rashi - and he slept on it; Rambam - it is as if he slept on it; Me'iri - the Beraisa discusses a normal case, normally one would not sleep directly on straw - the Heter depends only on sleeping) before Shabbos, he may move it with his hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana that argues with R. Shimon ben Gamliel [in Beraisa #1]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Chanina ben Akiva:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> R. Chanina ben Akiva once came to a place and found Chariyos that had been cut for the sake of wood; he told his Talmidim to intend to sit on them on the morrow (Shabbos) - I don't know if they were involved with a [wedding] celebration or consoling mourners.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This was permitted because they were busy with a celebration or consoling mourners - otherwise it is forbidden unless they were tied!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DESIGNATING DIRT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may bring a box of dirt into his house [before Shabbos] for all his needs on Shabbos (e.g. to cover spit or excrement).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> This is only if he designated a corner [of the house for the dirt].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rabanan):</span> This is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel (no action need be done to the dirt)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> It is even like Chachamim - they require an action only when it is possible - but nothing can be done to dirt to prepare it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One may rub Kelim with anything to polish them, except for silver Kelim, which may not be rubbed with alum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It is permitted to use nitre or sand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> It is forbidden to use nitre or sand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana #2 requires an action, Tana #1 does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No, neither Tana requires an action - Beraisa #2 is like R. Yehudah, who forbids Davar she'Eino Miskaven (he might scrape the Kli, this is Memachek (smoothing)); Beraisa #1 is like R. Shimon, who permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Seifa of Beraisa #1 is unlike R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> One may not shampoo his hair with them (nitre or sand).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon permits this!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">50b----------------------------------------50b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Nazir may shampoo his hair and separate the hairs [even though he might pull out hairs], but he may not comb his hair (Rashi - this surely pulls out hairs; Rashba - one who combs intends to remove dangling hairs).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Both Beraisos are like R. Yehudah - the Tana'im argue about R. Yehudah's opinion about scraping:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tana #1 holds that one might scrape, Tana #2 is not concerned for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot establish Beraisa #1 like R. Yehudah, on account of its Seifa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> One may wash his face, hands and feet [with nitre or sand, on Shabbos].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This might remove [facial] hair!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answers:</span> The Beraisa refers to a child, woman or Seris (they do not have beards).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT MAY BE USED TO WASH ONE'S SELF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A ground up brick (R. Chananel - frankincense) is permitted [for washing the face on Shabbos. Me'iri - hair of the head comes out easier than beard hairs].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The waste of sesame is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Ground up pepper is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Barda is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Barda?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It is one third aloe, one third myrtle [leaves], and one third violets.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Nechemyah bar Yosef):</span> As long as aloe is not the majority, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> On Shabbos, may one bruise olives (Rashi - on a rock, to temper their bitterness; Tosfos Yeshanim - on one's face, hands and feet, for the sake of washing - are we concerned lest they remove hair)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> This is always forbidden, on account of ruining food (Bal Tashchis).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Sheshes argues with Shmuel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may use bread for any need.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Bread is different, it does not get ruined like olives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Barda was brought in front of Ameimar, Mar Zutra and Rav Ashi - Ameimar and Rav Ashi washed with it, Mar Zutra did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Ameimar and Rav Ashi:</span> Rav Sheshes permits it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rav Mordechai:</span> Mar Zutra does not use it even during the week [on account of Beged Ishah, adorning oneself like a woman]:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A man may scrape hardened filth or scabs on account of pain, but not to beautify himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ameimar and Rav Ashi permit Barda - which Tana do they rely on?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> One should wash his face, hands and feet every day in honor of Hash-m (in whose 'form' he was made) - "Kol Po'al Hash-m la'Ma'anehu".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>RETURNING SOMETHING TO ITS STATE OF BEING <i>TAMUN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> One tilts the box and takes from the pot, lest he remove... [Chachamim say, he takes [the pot] and returns it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> All agree that if he removed the pot and the pit caved in, it is forbidden to return the pot (Rashi - one may not move the wool; Rambam - this is like new Hatmanah on Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> He takes [the pot] and returns it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the pit did not cave in, this is obvious (alternatively - R. Elazar would not argue)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The pit caved in, nevertheless Chachamim permit returning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question (c:1)):</span> Really, it did not cave in;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> They argue about whether or not we are concerned that it will cave in [and he will return it anyway] - R. Elazar is concerned for this, Chachamim are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashba):</span> They argue about whether or not we are concerned that it caved in - R. Elazar is concerned (one may not return unless he knows that it did not cave in) Chachamim are not (one may return unless he knows that it caved in).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If Slikusta (an herb) was inserted into moist dirt, removed and re-inserted before Shabbos, one may remove it (e.g. to smell it) and re-insert it on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If not (it was not removed and re-inserted before Shabbos), it is forbidden [even to remove it on Shabbos, for he will move dirt].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos (43B-44A), Rashba):</span> If not, it is forbidden [to return it on Shabbos, for this will widen the hole].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a knife was inserted between rows of bricks in a wall, removed and re-inserted before Shabbos, one may remove it and re-insert it on Shabbos; if not, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> One may insert a knife between branches coming out of a date stamp for the first time on Shabbos (we are not concerned lest he scrape off bark).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ketina, against Rav Huna and Shmuel - Mishnah):</span> If one is Tomen (Ramban, citing Yerushalmi - a bunch of) turnips or radishes under a vine, leaving some of the leaves (Rav Hai Gaon - some of them) exposed, we are not concerned for Kil'ai ha'Kerem, Shemitah, or Ma'aser; one may remove it on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Huna and Shmuel are refuted. (Tosfos ha'Rosh - surely, they knew the Mishnah! They established the case to be that the turnip was inserted, removed and re-inserted before Shabbos - the Gemara rejects this, and says that they are refuted.)</p>
