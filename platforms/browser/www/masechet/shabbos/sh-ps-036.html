<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MOVING A <i>SHOFAR</i> OR TRUMPET ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Abaye):</span> Surely, one may move an individual's shofar because it can be used to give water to a child to drink - likewise, the shofar of the Tzibur can be used to give water to an Oni to drink (the Tzibur must provide for needs of the poor)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Abaye - Beraisa #3):</span> Just like one may move a shofar, one may move a trumpet.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not like Beraisa #1 nor Beraisa #2!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> You must say that Beraisa #2 (which permits only a shofar) is like R. Yehudah (who forbids Muktzeh - he permits a shofar because it has a use, it is a Kli), Beraisa #3 (which permits both of them) is like R. Shimon (who permits Muktzeh), and Beraisa #1 (which forbids both of them) is like R. Nechemyah (who permits Kelim only for their designed use).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Implied question:</span> Beraisa #3 forbids a trumpet, just like a shofar - it is a bigger Chidush that a shofar is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer):</span> Beraisa #3 switches the words trumpet and shofar [from our usual understanding], like Rav Chisda taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The meanings of three [pairs of] words changed after the Churban - one is trumpet and shofar;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> On Rosh Hashanah we must blow [what was initially called] a shofar (but commoners now call it a trumpet).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Aravah (willow) and Tzaftzefa (which has white branches with round leaves) were switched;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> On Sukos, one of the four species we must take is [what was initially called] Aravah (but commoners now call it Tzaftzefa).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Petora (a big table) and Petorsa (a small table) were switched;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one says 'I sell to you Petorsa' (and the buyer does not see it, e.g. he bought it through Chalifin), he must give a big table (according to the present usage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Another pair has switched - Huvlila (Masas, the roundest stomach of a Kosher animal) and Bei Kasi (Beis ha'Kosos, the end of the Keres (the first stomach)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If a needle is found in the [wall of the] Beis ha'Kosos - if only one layer of the wall is punctured, it is Kosher; if both are punctured, it is Tereifah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Another pair has switched - Bavel and Borsif (another place in Chutz la'Aretz).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One must write the [current] name of the city on a Get (document of divorce - Rashi; Tosfos - it was enacted that when a Shali'ach brings a Get from Chutz la'Aretz, he must testify that he saw it written and signed - the enactment does not apply to Bavel (which is called Borsif today).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LEAVING A POT ON THE OVEN OR RETURNING IT TO THE OVEN ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kirah (oven) was heated with straw or stubble, one may put a Tavshil (cooked food) on it; (Maharam - Rashi says that one [also] cooks <i>in</i> it, to teach that it is unlike our ovens; we shall learn (37A) that the Mishnah discusses putting on top of it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If it was heated with Gefes (the waste of olives or sesame after the oil was extracted) or wood, one may not put in it unless it was Garuf v'Katum (the coals were swept [out; Ba'al ha'Ma'or - to the side] or ashes were put on the coals). (Whenever we discuss a Kirah that was not Garuf v'Katum, it was heated with Gefes or wood; putting food in is forbidden [Rashi - for it is Hatmanah in something that adds heat] lest one come to stoke coals.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Shamai permit hot water [for it does not require further cooking], but not a Tavshil (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Beis Hillel permit both of these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Beis Shamai permit removing from the Kirah, but not returning to it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Beis Hillel permit both of these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does it mean 'one may not put'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does it mean, one may not return to the Kirah - but Shehiyah (leaving in it when Shabbos begins) is permitted, even if it was Garuf v'Katum - this would be like Chananyah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chananya):</span> Shehiyah of anything k'Ma'achal Ben Drusai (a third or half cooked) is permitted, even if the stove was not Garuf or Katum (since it is edible, we are not concerned lest he stoke the coals).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps it refers to Shehiyah - this is permitted only if it was Garuf v'Katum, if not it is forbidden, all the more so returning is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> In the Mishnah, Beis Shamai permit hot water, but not a Tavshil - Beis Hillel permit both; Beis Shamai permit removing, but not returning - Beis Hillel permit both;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Reisha discusses Shehiyah, we understand this - it permits Shehiyah of a Tavshil on a Kirah heated with straw or stubble. If Gefes or wood was used, it is forbidden unless it was Garuf v'Katum;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Beis Shamai permit Shehiyah of hot water and forbid a Tavshil, Beis Hillel permit even a Tavshil;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>They also argue about returning - Beis Shamai permit removing and forbid returning, Beis Hillel permit both.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if the Reisha discusses returning, we must explain as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One may return a Tavshil to a Kirah heated with straw or stubble, if Gefes or wood was used, it is forbidden unless it was Garuf v'Katum;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Beis Shamai permit returning hot water and forbid a Tavshil, Beis Hillel permit even a Tavshil;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Beis Shamai permit removing and forbid returning [a Tavshil], Beis Hillel permit both.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The last clause is unnecessary!</p>
