<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CHAROSES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even though Charoses is not a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is not a Mitzvah, why do we bring it?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> It is on account of Kapa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> The cure for [one who got sick from] Kapa of lettuce is [to eat] radish;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The cure for Kapa of radishes is leeks; the cure for Kapa of leeks and all vegetables is hot water;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In the meantime, he should say 'Kapa, Kapa - I remember you and your seven daughters and eight daughters-in-law.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer b'Ribi Tzadok):</span> It is a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Mitzvah is it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Levi):</span> It [is made with apples, and] commemorates apple trees ("Tachas ha'Tapu'ach Orarticha" - in Mitzrayim, women gave birth painlessly to sextuplets under apple trees, out of sight of the Mitzriyim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It commemorates working in the mud.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Therefore [to fulfill both opinions], it must have [apples, which give a tinge of] sourness, to commemorate apple trees; and it must be thick, to commemorate mud.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> Charoses is made with spices to commemorate the straw [used to make bricks; cinnamon and ginger resemble straw]; it is ground finely, to commemorate mud;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>R. Eliezer b'Ribi Tzadok says, grocers in Yerushalayim used to say 'Come buy spices for the Mitzvah!'</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE FOUR QUESTIONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They mix a second cup of wine; the son asks his father [why we prepare to drink more before eating]; if the son does not know by himself, his father teaches him [the four questions]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>How different is tonight from all other nights! On all other nights we eat Chametz or Matzah - tonight we eat only Matzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>On all other nights we eat other vegetables - tonight we eat Maror!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>On all other nights we eat roasted, overcooked or cooked meat - tonight we eat only roasted! (This is asked when the Mikdash stands; it is like Ben Teima, who says that also Chagigah of the 14th is eaten roasted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>On all other nights we dip once - tonight we dip twice!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>His father teaches him according to what he can understand; we start with detriment, and end with praise (this will be explained); we expound from "Arami Oved Avi" (the account of Yetzi'as Mitzrayim one says when bringing Bikurim) until the end of the Parashah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> The son asks if he is clever; if not, the wife asks; if not, he asks himself;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Even two Chachamim who know laws of Pesach ask each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On all other nights we dip once - tonight we dip twice!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> We do not necessarily dip even once on other nights!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> It means that, on other nights we need not dip even once - tonight we [must] dip twice!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Safra):</span> Also tonight dipping is not an obligation - it is merely to arouse children!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Safra):</span> It should say, on other nights we do not dip even once - tonight we dip twice!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We start with detriment, and end with praise.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> With what detriment do we begin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> At the beginning our ancestors were idolaters.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> We were slaves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman (to his slave Daro):</span> If a master freed his slave and gave to him gold and silver, what must the slave say?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Daro:</span> He must thank and praise him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> You have exempted us from asking the four questions!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>Rav Nachman proceeded to say 'We were slaves...' (like Shmuel, his Rebbi).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HAGADAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Gamliel):</span> Anyone who did not say [why we eat] the following three things was not [properly] Yotzei [eating them, or Hagadah - see note in Appendix] - Pesach, Matzah and Maror;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">116b----------------------------------------116b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We eat Pesach because Hash-m Posach (skipped over; alternatively, had mercy - Rashi Shemos 12:23) on the houses of our ancestors in Mitzrayim [when He killed their firstborn] - "Va'Amartem Zevach Pesach Hu la'Shem Asher Posach..." ("Va'Amartem" commands to tell about Pesach; Matzah and Maror are equated to Pesach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We eat Matzah to commemorate the redemption of our ancestors from Mitzrayim -  "Va'Yofu Es ha'Batzek Asher Hotzi'u mi'Mitzrayim [Ugos Matzos]." (It shows the speed of the redemption - the journey to Sukos was 120 Mil (Rashi Shemos 12:37), and Yisrael arrived before the dough fermented, i.e. within the time to walk one Mil!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>We eat Maror to commemorate how the Mitzriyim embittered the lives of our ancestors in Mitzrayim - "Va'YMaRaRu Es Chayeihem."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>In every generation one must view (Rashbam - display) himself as if he left Mitzrayim - "V'Higadta l'Vincha...Ba'avur Zeh Asah Hash-m Li b'Tzeisi mi'Mitzrayim";</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Therefore, we are obligated to thank, praise, exalt, glorify and bless He who did all these miracles for our ancestors and for us:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He took us from slavery to freedom, from sighing to joy, from mourning to a Yom Tov, from darkness to great light, and from slavery to freedom, and we will say Halleluyah [in Hallel].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much of Hallel do we say [before the meal]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beis Shamai):</span> We say until "Em ha'Banim Semechah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beis Hillel):</span> We say until "Chalamish l'Mayno Mayim."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>We end Hagadah with [a Berachah of] redemption:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Tarfon says, [we bless] 'Who redeemed us and our ancestors from Mitzrayim' - there is no Chasimah (it does not end with Baruch...);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva says, 'So Hash-m...will bring us to more festivals waiting to greet us in Shalom; we will rejoice in the building of Your city and in Your service and eat [Pesachim and Chagigah]...Baruch Atah Hash-m Go'al Yisrael'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava):</span> One must say 'And He took us out of there'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One must lift the Matzah and Maror for everyone to see [when he says 'this Matzah that we eat' and 'this Maror...'; nowadays, if one or both of the cooked foods are meat,] one need not lift the meat;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Moreover, one should not do so, for it looks like he eats Kodshim outside the Mikdash (Rashbam - it looks like he is Makdish the meat)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> A blind person is exempt from saying Hagadah - it says "[V'Higadta...] Ba'avur Zeh," like it says "Benenu Zeh" [regarding Ben Sorer u'Moreh, a son killed for theft and gluttony];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like there it excludes someone (a parent) who is blind ("Zeh" connotes that one can see the matter discussed), also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Ameimar was told that Rav Yosef and Rav Sheshes [who were blind] used to say Hagadah in their houses [and others were Yotzei through their recitation]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They hold that nowadays the obligation of Hagadah is only mid'Rabanan [and it applies even to blind people].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that Rav Acha bar Yakov holds that nowadays it is mid'Oraisa - but he himself said that [not only Maror, but even] Matzah is mid'Rabanan today! (The Hagadah learns from "Ba'avur Zeh" that the Mitzvah of Hagadah is when Matzah and Maror are in front of you - if mid'Oraisa they do not apply, neither does Hagadah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that mid'Rabanan laws are patterned after mid'Oraisa (Chachamim would not obligate one who is exempt mid'Oraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, Rav Yosef and Rav Sheshes agree that mid'Rabanan laws are patterned after mid'Oraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Regarding Ben Sorer u'Moreh, it should have said 'Benenu Hu' - rather, it says "Benenu <i>Zeh</i>" to exclude blind parents;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Hagadah, there was no alternative to "Ba'avur Zeh" - [it does not include a blind person, rather,] it explains why we eat Matzah and Maror.</p></div>
