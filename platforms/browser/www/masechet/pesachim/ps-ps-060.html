<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DOES THE MISHNAH DISCUSS ONE OR TWO AVODOS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Papa) Question:</span> Does the Mishnah discuss different intents in one Avodah, or in different Avodos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it discusses different intents in one Avodah, it is like R. Yosi, who says that we are concerned even for a person's final words;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is unlike R. Meir, who says that we follow [only] his initial words (if he intended Lishmah and then Lo Lishmah, it is fully Lishmah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it discusses different intents in two Avodos, it is even like R. Meir;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Meir says that we follow [only] his initial words regarding one Avodah - he agrees that intents in two Avodos are Posel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which case of two intents does Rav Papa discuss?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he intended Lo Lishmah and then Lishmah, whether this was in one or two Avodos, R. Meir and R. Yosi agree that the first intent was already Posel!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yosi holds that we are concerned [for his first words, and] <i>even</i> for his final words.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He intended Lishmah and then Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If Pesach was slaughtered Lo Lishmah, and also Kabalah, Holachah and Zerikah were Lo Lishmah [it is Pasul].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If this is simply like it says, why must all four Avodos be Lo Lishmah - it is Pasul from the first Avodah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, it was slaughtered Lo Lishmah; alternatively, it was slaughtered Lishmah, and Kabalah, Holachah and Zerikah were Lo Lishmah; or slaughter, Kabalah and Holachah were Lishmah, and Zerikah was Lo Lishmah - i.e. intent in two Avodos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa - really, this is the middle clause):</span> Lishmah and then Lo Lishmah [is also Pasul].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it is in two Avodos, this is just like the Reisha!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is in one Avodah; the Mishnah is R. Yosi, who is concerned even for his final words!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question c:1):</span> No, the Seifa also discusses intent in two Avodos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Reisha discusses when each intent is for the Avodah he is currently doing; the Seifa discusses intent in an Avodah for a subsequent Avodah, e.g. he slaughters Lishmah, with intent to do Zerikah Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It teaches that intent from one Avodah to another takes effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> [Elsewhere] Rav Papa was unsure [also] about this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Conclusion:</span> This is why Rav Papa asked about the Mishnah (it can be explained either way)! (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (the actual Seifa):</span> If he intended Lo Lishmah and then Lishmah, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it is in two Avodos, even Lishmah and then Lo Lishmah is Pasul, it need not teach about Lo Lishmah and then Lishmah (the first Avodah was Posel)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is in one Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like the Seifa discusses one Avodah, also the Reisha (middle clause, of Lishmah and Lo Lishmah; the Mishnah is R. Yosi)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question e:1):</span> No, the Seifa also discusses intent in two Avodos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Indeed, it is not a Chidush - it was taught along with the case of Lishmah and then Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (the coming Mishnah):</span> If Pesach was slaughtered for people who cannot eat it (they are sick or old; or, if they are forbidden to eat it, e.g.), were not Menuyim on it (did not own a share), Arelim (uncircumcised; see note in Appendix) or Temei'im, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Clearly, this discusses one Avodah - since the Seifa discusses one Avodah, also the Reisha (our Mishnah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is not necessarily so - the Seifa discusses one Avodah, but the Reisha could discuss one or two Avodos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (the coming Mishnah):</span> If Pesach was slaughtered for people who can eat it and people who cannot, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It discusses two Avodos - it is Kosher because he intended for people who cannot eat it during Zerikah, and intent for who will eat it does not affect Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, we would infer that such intents in one Avodah in which intent for who will eat takes effect, e.g. slaughter, is Posel;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>But the Halachah is that intent for some people who can eat and some who cannot is not Posel!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it discusses one Avodah - since the Seifa discusses one Avodah, also the Reisha (our Mishnah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is not necessarily so - the Seifa discusses one Avodah, but the Reisha could discuss one or two Avodos!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PESACH LISHMAH AND LO LISHMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (If Pesach was slaughtered any day other than Erev Pesach Lo Lishmah, i.e. l'Shem Shelamim, it is Kosher; if it was Lishmah, it is Pasul.) If Pesach was slaughtered any other day of the year Lishmah and Lo Lishmah, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps the intent Lo Lishmah uproots the intent Lishmah, so it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps it does not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Dimi):</span> Pesach is Kosher Lishmah in its proper time, and Kosher Lo Lishmah any other time;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like Lishmah in its time does not uproot Lo Lishmah (if it was slaughtered with both intents it is Pasul), Lo Lishmah in its time does not uproot Lishmah, therefore it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yirmeyah):</span> No - Lo Lishmah is not uprooted, for it [is more prevalent, it] applies to all Korbanos [one does not fulfill his obligation if the Avodah was Lo Lishmah - sometimes this even disqualifies the Korban];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But Lishmah can be uprooted, for it is Pasul only regarding Pesach [outside its time].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If Pesach was slaughtered any other day Lishmah and Lo Lishmah, it is Kosher, for Stam (without specifying) it is [destined to be slaughtered in its time] Lishmah, nevertheless slaughter Lo Lishmah is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that Lo Lishmah uproots its normal Lishmah status - likewise, when it is slaughtered Lishmah and Lo Lishmah, the Lo Lishmah uproots the Lishmah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> Perhaps we distinguish when he explicitly said that he slaughters Lishmah to when he did not!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Slaughter for Ochlav (people who may eat it) and Lo l'Ochlav (for people who may not eat it) is Kosher, even though slaughter Lo l'Ochlav is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Stam it is l'Ochlav - even Lo l'Ochlav should be like l'Ochlav and Lo l'Ochlav!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows that explicitly saying the intent is unlike Stam.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> These are very different!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>As long as one does not specify Lo Lishmah in slaughter, Stam it is Lishmah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We cannot say that Stam it is for Ochlav - perhaps its owners will be Menuyim on another Korban, and others will be Menuyim on this!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may be Manuy on a Korban or retract from Minuy until it is slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Pesach was slaughtered any other day b'Shinuy Ba'alim (with intent for people other than its owners), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Is Shinuy Ba'alim like intent for another Korban (Lo Lishmah), and it is Kosher, or not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> Shinuy Ba'alim is Posel in its time, just like Lo Lishmah - just like Lo Lishmah is Posel in its time and is Machshir at other times, also Shinuy Ba'alim!</p></div>
