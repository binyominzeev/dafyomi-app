<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it permitted these [invalid] Matzos after eating [valid] Matzah with appetite, one might have thought that he may not eat these first, lest eating Matzas Mitzvah will be Achilah Gasah (gorging himself) - therefore the Beraisa permits even to eat them first.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IS MATZAH MID'ORAISA NOWADAYS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Nowadays Matzah is a Mitzvah mid'Oraisa; Maror is only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, Maror is mid'Rabanan because "Al Matzos u'Morerim Yochluhu" - it is mid'Oraisa only when there is Korban Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The same applies to Matzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Another verse teaches "Ba'Erev Tochlu Matzos" (in any case).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> Both of them are mid'Rabanan today.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says "Ba'Erev Tochlu Matzos"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That obligates a Tamei or Derech Rechokah [when the Mikdash stands] to eat Matzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since they do not eat Pesach, they need not eat Matzah and Maror - the verse teaches that this is not so. (Ran - Maror is mentioned along with Matzah, but really, [mid'Oraisa] the only Mitzvah to eat Maror is with Pesach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Rava does not need a verse for a Tamei or Derech Rechokah - he holds that there is no reason to exempt them more than an Arel or Ben Nechar:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Chol Arel Lo Yochal <i>Bo</i>" - he may not eat it (Pesach), but he eats Matzah and Maror. (It also says "V'Chol Ben Nechar Lo Yochal Bo.")</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Rav Acha holds that the Torah needs to teach about both of them. (Had it only taught Arel and Ben Nechar, we would have said that they eat Matzah because they will not bring Pesach Sheni - but Tamei and Derech Rechokah, who will bring Pesach Sheni, will eat Matzah then; had it only written "Ba'Erev Tochlu Matzos," we would have said that this refers to Arel and Ben Nechar for the above reason.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Beraisa):</span> "Sheshes Yomim Tochal Matzos uva'Yom ha'Shevi'i Atzeres" - just like eating Matzah on the seventh day is Reshus (the Torah did not command about it), also six days [and a half, i.e. after the first night];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a matter which was part of a Kelal ("Shiv'as Yomim Tochal Matzos"), and the Torah taught about it by itself - the rule is, in every such case we learn to the entire Kelal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps even the first night is Reshus!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Al Matzos u'Merorim Yochluhu."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps that is only when the Mikdash stands - what is the source when the Mikdash does not stand?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ba'Erev Tochal Matzos" - it is an obligation.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MAY ONE RESUME EATING AFTER SLEEPING?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If some of the Chaburah slept, they may resume to eat [Pesach];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the entire Chaburah slept, they may not resume to eat (it would look like eating Pesach in two places).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">120b----------------------------------------120b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yosi says, if they (some of the Chaburah) dozed, they may eat; if they slept, they may not eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Pesach is Metamei the hands after midnight;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Pigul and Nosar are Metamei hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> R. Yosi permits eating if they dozed, but not if they slept - what is considered dozing?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He is half asleep, half awake; if one calls to him, he responds, but cannot give an answer which requires thought; if one reminds him [that he heard this], he remembers (Rashi Ta'anis 12B).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Rabah dozed [after beginning to eat Matzas Mitzvah]; Abaye mentioned this.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE LAST TIME TO EAT PESACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Pesach is Metamei the hands after midnight.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> After midnight it is Nosar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> It is R. Elazar ben Azaryah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> It says "V'Ochlu Es ha'Basar ba'Laylah ha'Zeh," and "V'Ovarti v'Eretz Mitzrayim ba'Laylah ha'Zeh" - just like the firstborn were killed at midnight, also the allotted time to eat Pesach is [until] midnight;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva says, Pesach is eaten "b'Chipazon" (in haste) - until the time of haste (dawn, when Mitzrayim compelled Yisrael to leave.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it did not need to say "ba'Laylah"!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that it may be eaten during the day like other Kodshim - "ba'Laylah" teaches that it may be eaten only at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [According to R. Elazar, "ha'Zeh" (in "V'Ochlu...") is needed for the Gezerah Shavah - but] according to R. Akiva, what do we learn from "ha'Zeh"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is needed to forbid eating Pesach on a second night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought, since Pesach is Kodshim Kalim like Shelamim, just like Shelamim may be eaten for two days and a night, [since the time to eat Pesach begins at night], nights of Pesach are like days of Shelamim, and it may be eaten for two nights and a day!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Ha'Zeh" teaches that it is eaten for only one night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Elazar says, we already know this from "V'Lo Sosiru Mimenu Ad Boker."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Akiva says, we could have understood that to refer to the second morning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Elazar says, whenever it says "Boker," it refers to the next morning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Nowadays, according to R. Elazar, if someone ate Matzah after midnight, he was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious - since Matzah is Hukash (equated) to Pesach, it is like Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Torah uprooted it from the Hekesh [by commanding to eat Matzah even when there is no Pesach] - Rava teaches that this is not so, rather, the Mitzvah to eat Matzah nowadays is like when there is Pesach.</p></div>
