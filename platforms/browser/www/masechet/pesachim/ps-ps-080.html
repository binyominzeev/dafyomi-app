<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN HALF OF YISRAEL ARE TEHORIM (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If Yisrael was half Tehorim and half Temei'im, Tehorim bring by themselves and Temei'im by themselves;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If there were more Temei'im than Tehorim, even one more, they [may all] bring b'Tum'ah, for we do not divide a Korban Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Masya says, the Tzibur is not considered Tamei on account of an individual - "Lo Suchal Lizbo'ach Es ha'Posach <i>b'Echad</i>" (on account of one person).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Shimon says, even if one Shevet is Tamei and the others are Tehorim, Tehorim bring by themselves and Temei'im by themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that each Shevet is called a Kahal (congregation).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if one Shevet is Tamei and the others are Tehorim, Pesach is brought b'Tumah, for we do not divide a Korban Tzibur</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that each Shevet is called a Kehal; it is as if Yisrael is half Tahor and half Tamei, and we do not divide a Korban Tzibur, therefore all bring b'Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Yisrael was half Tehorim and half Temei'im, we Metamei one person with a Sheretz [so Temei'im will be the majority and everyone can bring Pesach together b'Tum'ah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should leave it half-half - Rav holds that in such a case Tehorim bring by themselves and Temei'im by themselves!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, there was one more Tamei than Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we need not Metamei anyone - Temei'im are already the majority, everyone can bring it together b'Tum'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like R. Eliezer ben Masya, who says that the Tzibur is not considered Tamei on account of an individual.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The previous question returns - we should not Metamei anyone; Tehorim will bring by themselves and Temei'im by themselves!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he holds that if there is a Tana who holds like the first Tana, who does not allow everyone to bring together b'Tum'ah when Yisrael is half-half, and like R. Yehudah who holds that we do not divide a Korban Tzibur, then we Metamei one of them with a Sheretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> We send one of the Tehorim to Derech Rechokah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't he say to Metamei him with a Sheretz?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> he holds that we slaughter and Zorek for a Tamei Sheretz [since he can eat at night, therefore he is considered Tahor].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't he say to Metamei him through a Mes?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, he will not be able to bring Chagigah [of the 15th, since he will be Tamei for seven days].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we send him away, he cannot bring Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He can bring Pesach Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Likewise, if we would Metamei him b'Mes, he could bring Chagigah on the seventh day of Pesach, for it will be the eighth day from his Tum'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ula holds that the last six days one may bring Chagigah are compensation for the first day - only one who could have brought it on the first day may bring it later. (Sha'agas Aryeh (65) - we are not concerned that for six days he will be unable to fulfill Simchah by eating Shelamim, for mid'Oraisa one can fulfill Simchah in other ways, e.g. meat and wine.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> Ula's counsel is unreasonable - who will agree to uproot his tent and go away?!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TIMES WHEN TEMEI'IM CANNOT BRING PESACH SHENI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If most of Yisrael were Zavim and the minority were Tamei Mes, [even] those who were Tamei Mes do not bring either Pesach:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They do not bring Pesach Rishon, for they are a minority;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They do not bring Pesach Sheni, for it is brought only when the Tzibur brings Pesach Rishon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel):</span> How do you fulfill "V'Ya'asu Venei Yisrael Es ha'Posach b'Mo'ado"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav):</span> According to you, what happens when all of Yisrael are Zavim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must agree that then we cannot fulfill "ha'Posach b'Mo'ado";</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Likewise, when most are Zavim and the minority is Tamei Mes we cannot fulfill it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If most were Tamei Mes and the minority were Zavim, there is no compensation [on Pesach Sheni for the Zavim [or anyone else] who did not bring] Pesach ha'Ba b'Tumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> There is compensation for Pesach ha'Ba b'Tumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Ada holds that there is compensation because he holds that Tum'ah Hutrah b'Tzibur (it is considered as if Pesach was brought b'Taharah, therefore there is compensation for other Temei'im); Rav Huna holds that there is no compensation because he holds that Tum'ah is Nidcheh b'Tzibur. (Tosfos - the Torah commands a Tamei to bring Pesach Sheni only when "Ish Ish Ki Yihyeh Tamei...," i.e. he is Tamei but the Tzibur is Tahor.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree that Tum'ah is Nidcheh b'Tzibur - Rav Huna holds that only [Pesach brought in] Taharah detains people to Pesach Sheni, Rav Ada holds that even Tum'ah detains people to Pesach Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">80b----------------------------------------80b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Mani bar Patish):</span> If a third of Yisrael were Zavim, a third were Tehorim, and a third were Tamei Mes, [even] those who were Tamei Mes do not bring either Pesach:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They do not bring Pesach Rishon, for they are a minority (the Zavim join with the Tehorim to outnumber them);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They do not bring Pesach Sheni, for the majority did not bring Pesach Rishon, and a majority is not detained to Pesach Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN THERE IS RITZUY FOR TUM'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If blood of Pesach was thrown and then it became known that it (Tosfos - the blood; Rashi - or meat) was Tamei, the Tzitz is Meratzeh;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>It is not Meratzeh if the owner became Tamei (he must bring Pesach Sheni);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It was taught that the Tzitz is Meratzeh Pesach and Korbanos Nazir if the blood became Tamei, not if he was Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he became Tamei through <i>Tum'as ha'Tehom</i>, the Tzitz is Meratzeh. (Rashi - this is a Tum'ah which at the time the person became Tamei, perhaps no one ever knew that there was Tum'ah there; Rambam - at the time, no one knew about it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> It is Meratzeh because he did not find out until after Zerikah - but if he knew at the time of Zerikah, it is not Meratzeh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> The Tzitz is Meratzeh for blood, meat and Chelev that became Tamei, whether [Zerikah was] b'Shogeg or b'Mezid or b'Ones, for a Korban Yachid or a Korban Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (Ravina):</span> The Beraisa discusses the Tum'ah (the Tzitz is Meratzeh even if they became Tamei b'Mezid), our Mishnah discusses the intent during Zerikah (it is not Meratzeh for Mezid. Tosfos - mid'Oraisa, whether it was Shogeg or Mezid, it is Meratzeh - mid'Rabanan, it is not Meratzeh to allow eating the meat, but he does not bring Pesach Sheni.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #2 (R. Shila):</span> There is Ritzuy for Zerikah whether it was Shogeg or Mezid; there is Ritzuy only if the Tum'ah was b'Shogeg.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against R. Shila - Beraisa):</span> ...Whether [Tum'ah was] b'Shogeg or b'Mezid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No - it means that if the Tum'ah was b'Shogeg, whether Zerikah was b'Shogeg or b'Mezid it is Meratzeh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that it is Meratzeh if he did not find out until after Zerikah - but if he knew at the time of Zerikah, it is not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is Meratzeh in either case - it discusses finding out after Zerikah for parallel structure with the Seifa, which teaches that if the owner became Tamei it is not Meratzeh [even] if he did not find out until after Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he became Tamei through Tum'as ha'Tehom...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If a Kohen offering Korbanos [Nazir or Pesach] was Nitma Tum'as ha'Tehom, are they valid?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps the leniency only applies to the owner - or, perhaps it is a law of Zevachim, it applies to the Kohen and owner alike!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - R. Chiya's Beraisa):</span> Tum'as ha'Tehom applies only to Tum'as Mes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It excludes Tum'as Sheretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whose Tum'ah does it discuss?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1A:</span> It discusses Tum'ah of the owner.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>It cannot discuss Nazir, for the only Tum'ah that interrupts Nezirus [or invalidates the Korban] is Tum'as Mes - "V'Chi Yamus Mes Alav"!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rather, it must discuss Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is according to the opinion that we do not slaughter and Zorek for one who is Tamei Sheretz - but according to the opinion that we do, there is no Chidush of Tum'as ha'Tehom - even known Tum'ah is Meratzeh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1B:</span> Rather, it discusses Tum'ah of the Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question (1) - Rav Yosef):</span> Indeed, it discusses Tum'ah of the owner regarding Pesach - however, it comes to exclude Tum'as ha'Tehom of Zivah (retroactive Tum'ah on account of a later sighting - at the time, no one knew about it), it is not Meratzeh.</p></div>
