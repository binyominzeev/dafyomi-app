<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Abaye):</span> You contradict yourself!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah, of Rav Chisda or Rav Huna):</span> If one brought a sheep from the swamp (it does not normally go near people, it is Muktzeh) and slaughtered it for the Tamid (daily offering) on Yom Tov, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> [A verse in Yechezkeil specifies what may be offered (Tosfos - for Pesach) -] "V'Seh" - not a Bechor; "Achas" - not Ma'aser; "Min ha'Tzon" - not a Palgas (a sheep in its 13th month - it is no longer a Keves (lamb), but it is not yet an Ayil (ram));</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Min ha'Masayim" - [regarding Nesachim, if a volume of Orlah fell into a pit, one may bring] from the remaining 200 volumes in the pit [after deducting the amount that fell in];</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One may not bring from something intrinsically forbidden, like Tevel - Muktzeh is not intrinsically forbidden, rather, it is Asur on account of something else (Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>If Muktzeh is mid'Oraisa, is makes no difference whether or not the Isur is intrinsic!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Abaye):</span> You yourself say that the Melachos are separate regarding Shabbos (if one forgot several Melachos and transgressed them, he brings a Korban for each), but not regarding Yom Tov (he is lashed only once for several Melachos - why is he lashed for cooking on Yom Tov <i>and</i> for using Muktzeh?)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 2:m, 47B - Rava):</span> Rather, it should omit burning; the wood was from an Asherah, he transgresses "V'Lo Yidbak b'Yadcha Me'umah Min ha'Cherem"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection: (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If so, he also transgresses "V'Lo Savi To'evah El Beisecha"!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps R.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> Perhaps R. Yehoshua does not say Ho'il because one of them may not be eaten by anyone - but he would permit when everything could be eat by guests!</p></div>
