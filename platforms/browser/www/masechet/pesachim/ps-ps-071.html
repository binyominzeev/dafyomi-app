<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MUST SHALMEI SIMCHAH BE SLAUGHTERED AT THE TIME OF SIMCHAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "V'Hayisa Ach Some'ach" is extra - it includes [in the Mitzvah of Simchah] the last night (Rashi; Tosfos - and day) of Yom Tov (Shemini Atzeres).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it includes the first night of Yom Tov! (If both are equally reasonable, we may learn both!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ach" always limits.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We do not include the first night of Yom Tov for Simchah is not possible then (a Korban slaughtered before Yom Tov is invalid for Simchah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No - the Beraisa itself explains why:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> Why do we include the last night and exclude the first night?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is because Simchah applies before the last night, but not before the first night (see note in Appendix).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> One may fulfill the Mitzvah of Simchah through the Chagigah of the 14th, but not the Mitzvah of [Stam] Chagigah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One fulfills Simchah even though it was slaughtered before the time of Simchah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> The case is, an animal was Hukdash for Chagigah of the 14th, but he did not slaughter it until the 15th.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi):</span> Surely this is the case - Ben Teima taught this Beraisa, and he disqualifies Chagigah of the 14th at dawn [of the 15th, when the Mitzvah of Simchah begins - it does not apply to the first night]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> Hallel and Simchah apply for eight days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If slaughter must be at the time of Simchah, it is not always eight days, i.e. when Yom Tov is on Shabbos (one may not slaughter before the second day! Rather, we must say that one may slaughter on Erev Yom Tov.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehudah):</span> One may fulfill Simchah [on the first day] through the Chatas offered with Musaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rava):</span> On Shabbos, it may be eaten only Chai - one cannot fulfill Simchah [during the day] with meat that is Chai (raw - it may not be cooked at all until night - Rashi; R. Chananel - it is half-roasted on Shabbos, so Kohanim can eat on Shabbos to Mechaper for Yisrael - Simchah requires properly roasted meat).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rava):</span> Only Kohanim may eat from the Chatas (surely, the Mishnah teaches that Simchah applies to Yisrael for eight days)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> [Since it is impossible to eat Shelamim on the first day,] one may fulfill Simchah through clean clothing and old wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> If one slaughtered a Shelamim before Yom Tov, he fulfills Simchah, but not Chagigah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He fulfills Simchah, for we do not require slaughter at a time of Simchah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He does not fulfill Chagigah, because an obligatory Korban must be brought from Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "V'Hayisa Ach Some'ach" - this includes the last night of Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it rather includes the first night of Yom Tov!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ach" divides.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We do not include the first night of Yom Tov for Simchah is not possible then!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No - the Beraisa explains why:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> Why do we include the last night and exclude the first?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is because Simchah applies before the last night, but not before the first night.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE TIME LIMIT FOR CHELEV AND MEAT OF CHAGIGAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana) Question:</span> What is the source that Chelev of Chagigah of the 15th becomes Pasul overnight?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Right after "V'Lo Yalin Chelev Chagi Ad Boker" it says "Reishis," to teach that "Boker" refers to the first morning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> Had it not said "Reishis," would we say that it refers to the second morning?! We never find that the meat becomes Pasul at night [of the 17th] and the Chelev is permitted [longer,] until morning!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> R. Elazar ben Azaryah holds that meat of Pesach is Pasul after midnight, yet the Chelev is Kosher all night!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Rav Yosef asks, without any verse, the Tana [of the coming Beraisa] assumes that "Boker" regarding eating means the first morning, whereas Rav Kahana needs a verse for Chelev, which is more stringent (it is never permitted for two days, whereas some Korbanos may be eaten for two days)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Lo Yalin Min ha'Basar Asher Tizbach ba'Erev ba'Yom ha'Rishon la'Boker" - this teaches that Chagigah of the 14th may be eaten for two days and a night.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">71b----------------------------------------71b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is permitted only for one day and a night!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ba'Yom ha'Rishon" teaches that [it may be eaten the entire first day], hence "la'Boker" refers to the second morning (the 16th).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it really refers to the first morning! (We shall explain this suggestion below.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it was taught that Chagigah may be eaten for two days [and a night]!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This would apply to other Chagigos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Im Neder O Nedavah [...ba'Yom Hakrivo Es Zivcho Ye'achel umi'Macharas]" permits Chagigah of the 14th for two days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> After the Beraisa proved that 'Boker' refers to the second morning, why did it suggest that it refers to the first?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the verse alludes to two Chagigos, of the 14th and of the 15th, and each may be eaten until its [first] morning;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana then asked, this contradicts the Halachah, that Chagigah may be eaten for two days, for we suggest that both Chagigos may be eaten only for one day and a night!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He concludes that "V'Im Neder..." permits Chagigah of the 15th for two days; "Ba'Yom ha'Rishon..." discusses only Chagigah of the 14th, and permits for two days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Reformulation of Rav Yosef's question:</span> The Tana says that "la'Boker" refers to the second morning only because it says "Ba'Yom ha'Rishon" - without this, he assumes that it means the first morning! (This is not answered.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>LIABILITY FOR SLAUGHTERING A PASUL PESACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If [on Erev Pesach on Shabbos] one slaughtered Pesach Lo Lishmah (it is Pasul) he is Chayav Chatas [for Chilul Shabbos];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he slaughtered any other Korban l'Shem Pesach [on this day]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the animal was unfit for Pesach (e.g. a bull or a female), he is Chayav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was fit for Pesach, R. Eliezer is Mechayev Chatas, and R. Yehoshua exempts [because he tried to do a Mitzvah and erred].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> It is permitted to slaughter Pesach Lishmah, nevertheless, if he slaughtered it l'Shem anything else he is Chayav - all the more so, he is liable for other Korbanos Lo Lishmah, for even Lishmah they are forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> You cannot learn from Pesach which was slaughtered l'Shem something forbidden to offer on Shabbos, to slaughtering Korbanos l'Shem something permitted (Pesach)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Korbanos Tzibur (Tamid and Musafim) disprove this - they are permitted Lishmah, yet if one slaughtered another Korban l'Shem them, he is liable!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Those are different, for there is a limit how many must be offered (it is unreasonable to err and offer another) - but everyone offers Pesach (even if he already offered his, perhaps he saw an animal in the Azarah and assumed that it is also a Pesach - nothing else is offered after the Tamid)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Meir says, even one who slaughters l'Shem Korbanos Tzibur is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>If he slaughtered Pesach for the following, he is liable - Lo l'Ochlav, Lo li'Mnuyav (people that do not own a share), Arelim or Temei'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>If he slaughtered l'Ochlav and Lo l'Ochlav, li'Mnuyav and Lo li'Mnuyav, for Mulim and Arelim, or for Temei'im and Tehorim he is exempt (the Korban is Kosher).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>If he slaughtered it and then found that it has a blemish, he is liable (he should have examined it beforehand);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he found that it has an internal [problem that makes it] Tereifah, he is exempt (he could not have known before slaughter).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>If he slaughtered it and then found that the owners withdrew and were Menuyim on a different Pesach, or died, or became Temei'im, he is exempt, for [this is Ones,] he was allowed to slaughter.</p></div>
