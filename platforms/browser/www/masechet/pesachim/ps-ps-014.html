<p class="dedicationbox">12TH CYCLE DEDICATIONS:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>PESACHIM 12-15 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the sixth Yahrzeit of her father, Reb Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rebbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study, which was so important to him, during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>INCREASING TUM'AH OF PESULIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Chanina Segan ha'Kohanim):</span> Kohanim never refrained from burning [Kodesh] meat that became Tamei through a Vlad ha'Tum'ah with meat that became Tamei through an Av ha'Tum'ah, even though this increases the Tum'ah of the former meat (this will be explained; also, see note in Appendix);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Akiva taught further - Kohanim never refrained from burning [Kodesh] oil that became Tamei through a Tevul Yom (someone who was Tamei and immersed today; he remains slightly Tamei until nightfall) in a lamp that became Tamei through a Tamei Mes, even though this increases its Tum'ah (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Meir says, we learn from their words that one may burn Tahor Terumah [of Chametz] together with Tamei Terumah [at the time of Bi'ur] on [Erev] Pesach even though this is Metamei it [since it had to be burned anyway].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> We may not learn this! R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua agree that each is burned by itself - they argue about Taluy and Tamei Terumah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer says that each is burned by itself; R. Yehoshua permits burning them together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Meat that became Tamei through an Av is a Rishon l'Tum'ah; meat that became Tamei through a Vlad is a Sheni - [why did R. Chanina say that burning them together increases the Tum'ah,] a Rishon only makes a Sheni!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The case is, the latter meat touched a Sheni, it is only a Shelishi - R. Chanina permits [burning it with a Rishon and] making it a Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Food does not Metamei food!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps food is Metamei food!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rejection "V'Chi Yutan Mayim Al Zera v'Nofal mi'Nivlasam Alav Tamei <i>Hu</i>" - it (food) is Tamei, but it is not Metamei [other food] like itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> According to Abaye, the Beraisa discusses Chulin, but Terumah and Kodshim are Metamei [other foods] like themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> According to Rav Ada bar Ahavah in the name of Rava, the Beraisa discusses Chulin and Terumah, but Kodshim are Metamei like themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> However, Ravina says in the name of Rava that the verse applies to everything - Chulin, Terumah, and Kodshim do not Metamei like themselves - how can he answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The case is, there are liquids with the meat - the liquids Metamei the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, why does it say that they would burn 'with meat that became Tamei through an Av ha'Tum'ah' - it should say 'with meat and liquids'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Food does not Metamei food mid'Oraisa, but mid'Rabanan it does.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE CHIDUSH OF R. AKIVA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Akiva taught further - Kohanim never refrained...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Oil that became Tamei through a Tevul Yom is a Shelishi; when it is burned in a lamp that became Tamei through a Tamei Mes (a Rishon), the oil becomes a Sheni - this is just like R. Chanina taught (why does it say 'R. Akiva taught further'?! This is not difficult according to Answer #4, for R. Chanina discusses [increasing Tum'ah] mid'Rabanan, and R. Akiva discusses mid'Oraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> That Mishnah discusses a metal lamp;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "Ba'Chalal Cherev" -a sword [or anything else metal that touched a corpse] becomes like a Mes (Avi Avos ha'Tum'ah, i.e. it can make an Av ha'Tum'ah - likewise), the lamp becomes [like the Tamei Mes it touched;] an Av ha'Tum'ah;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva permits to Metamei a Shelishi and make it a Rishon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What forced Rav Yehudah to say that it discusses a metal lamp? He could have said that it is Cheres - R. Chanina only permitted increasing Tum'ah of something already <i>Tamei</i> (it can Metamei other things), and R. Akiva permits to make Tamei something that was only Pasul (disqualified, but it could not Metamei anything else)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava) Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say that the lamp became Tamei through a Tamei Mes? It could have said that it touched a Sheretz (dead rodent, a lighter Tum'ah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows that it discusses a lamp which receives a different Tum'ah from a Tamei Mes than from a Sheretz, i.e. a metal lamp (it becomes an Av ha'Tum'ah through a Tamei Mes).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference (Rava):</span> This shows that R. Akiva holds that mid'Oraisa, liquids can Metamei other things;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was Metamei only mid'Rabanan, the lamp did not change anything - the oil was already Pasul [and still it cannot Metamei mid'Oraisa]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [Perhaps it is not mid'Oraisa -] the lamp enables the oil to Metamei other things mid'Rabanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the Mishnah would not have had to say that the lamp was an Av ha'Tum'ah - even if it was a Rishon or Sheni, it would make the oil a Rishon [mid'Rabanan, which can Metamei]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only Tum'ah that is Posel Terumah but does not make a liquid a Rishon is a Tevul Yom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> He holds that liquids can Metamei mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FROM WHERE DOES R. MEIR LEARN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> We learn from their words...[that one may burn Tahor and Tamei Terumah together].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> From whom do we learn this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from R. Chanina.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Chanina only permitted increasing Tum'ah of something already Tamei - R. Meir permits to Metamei something Tahor!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from R. Akiva.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Akiva only permitted to Metamei something Pasul - R. Meir permits to Metamei something Tahor!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Meir holds that the Mishnah discusses an Av ha'Tum'ah mid'Oraisa and a Vlad ha'Tum'ah mid'Rabanan - mid'Oraisa, the meat was Tahor; we learn from R. Chanina [that we may burn in the sixth hour, when Chametz is permitted mid'Oraisa and forbidden mid'Rabanan].</p></div>
