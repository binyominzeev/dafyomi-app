<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE EXILE AND THE REDEMPTION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Hash-m exiled Yisrael to Bavel in order that they will eat dates and be able to engage in Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Ula visited Pumbedisa [in Bavel] - they brought to him a basket of dates. He was told that three baskets sell for one Zuz. Ula was astounded - one can get a jar of honey so cheaply, and people here do not [find more time to] learn Torah?! (Dates give sustenance - if one blessed Birkas ha'Mazon after eating them, he was Yotzei - Shulchan Aruch 208:17.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>At night, Ula had intestinal pain on account of the dates. He was astounded - a lethal poison like this costs a Zuz [surely, proper food costs much more], nevertheless people here [find some time to] learn Torah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar) Question:</span> "...Lechu v'Na'aleh El Har Hash-m El Beis <i>Elokei Yakov</i>" - He is also Elokei Avraham and Elokei Yitzchak!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beis ha'Mikdash is not attributed to Avraham, for he called its place a mountain - "B'Har Hash-m Yera'eh;"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not attributed to Yitzchak, for he called it a field - "Va'Yetzei Yitzchak Lasu'ach ba'Sadeh" (Yitzchak did not say these words, but surely the Torah calls it a field because Yitzchak considered it a field);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is attributed to Yakov, for he called it a house (a settled place) - "Va'Yikra Es Shem ha'Makom ha'Hu Beis Kel."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The gathering of exiles is as great as the day Heaven and earth were created - it says "V'Nikbetzu Benei Yehudah u'Venei Yisrael Yachdav...v'Alu Min ha'Aretz Ki Gadol <i>Yom</i> Yizre'el" , like "Va'Yhi Erev va'Yhi Voker Yom Echad."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHOSE CONSENT IS REQUIRED FOR MINUY?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If overseers of an orphan slaughtered for him [he eats from whichever he wants].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This teaches that Yesh Breirah (it is as if he was Manuy retroactively at the time of slaughter on the one he chooses now! Tosfos - regarding a wife, we rejected this, perhaps she decided at the time of slaughter - but if the same applies here, what is the Chidush of this clause?!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Zeira):</span> "Seh l'Veis" (a man is Moneh his household on his Pesach) in any case [even without their consent - see note in Appendix].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "Seh l'Veis" - this teaches that a man brings and slaughters Pesach for his minor children and Kena'ani slaves with or without their consent;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>One may not slaughter for his adult children, Ivri slaves or wife without their consent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> One may not slaughter for his adult children, Ivri slaves or wife without their consent;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>One may slaughter for his minor children and Kena'ani slaves with or without their consent;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>If anyone slaughtered his own Pesach, and his master [or father or husband] slaughtered for him, he is Yotzei with his master's, except for a wife, who can protest.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is different about a wife [from others whose consent is required]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It means, a wife and those like her [can protest].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [If one slaughtered his own....he is Yotzei with his master's [or husband's,] except for a wife, who can protest - this implies that if she does not protest, she is Yotzei with his Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But the Reisha says that he may not slaughter for her without her consent - this implies that Stam (if she was silent), she is Yotzei with his Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'With her consent' does not mean that she expressed consent - rather, it means Stam, and it excludes when she protests.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> 'If anyone slaughtered and his master slaughtered...' connotes Stam - still, it says except for a wife, who can protest!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> This does not connote Stam - slaughtering one's own Pesach is the ultimate protest!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FROM WHOSE PESACH CAN A HALF-SLAVE EAT?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a slave had two masters...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Eina Sava - Mishnah):</span> If a slave had two masters [and both slaughtered for him], he may not eat from either one;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> He may eat from whichever he wants.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution (Rav Nachman):</span> The Mishnah is when each master is Makpid [that he or his property not benefit from the other master]; the Beraisa is when neither is Makpid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A half-slave may not eat from his master's Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He may not eat from his master's Pesach [because his master did not intend to Memaneh the free half], but he may eat from his own.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> He may not eat from his master's Pesach, nor from his own.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> At first, the Halachah was like the Beraisa (the master does not want his half to benefit from the free half); later (after Beis Hillel retracted), the Halachah follows the Mishnah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Hillel):</span> A half-slave alternates - he serves his master for one day, and works for himself for one day;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> That is good for the master, but not for the slave - he cannot marry!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">88b----------------------------------------88b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He cannot marry a slave [since he is half-free]; he cannot marry a Bas Yisrael [since he is partially a slave].</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he will not marry!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The world was created for the sake of reproduction - "Lasheves Yetzarah!"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rather, we force the master to free the slave; the slave writes a document obligating himself to pay the master half of his value.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Beis Hillel retracted, and agreed with Beis Shamai. (Since we force the master to free him, the slave is considered free, and eats from his own Korban.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ONE WHO DID NOT SPECIFY WHICH IS HIS PESACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told his slave 'slaughter Pesach for me' [without specifying which species], whether he slaughtered a goat or lamb, Reuven eats it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he slaughtered a goat and lamb, Reuven eats from the first one slaughtered;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If [Reuven specified and] the slave forgot which one, what should he do?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should slaughter one of each and stipulate [beforehand]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If my master specified a goat, it is for him and the lamb is my Pesach; if he specified a lamb, it is for him and the goat is for me.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If Reuven forgot what he specified, both of them are burned; Reuven and his slave are exempt from Pesach Sheni. (It sounds like no one else was Nimneh on either Korban, i.e. like the opinion that we slaughter Pesach for an individual (91A). However, we can say that Reuven told two slaves 'slaughter for me and my family' - indeed, the Gemara will establish the Reisha like this, for another reason.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Objection:</span> Obviously, if he slaughtered a goat Reuven eats it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is, even if Reuven usually offers one species and the slave offered the other, Reuven eats it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he slaughtered a goat and lamb, Reuven eats from the first one slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One may not be Nimneh on two Pesachim at the same time (the slave was Memaneh Reuven on two)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses a king and queen:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not be Nimneh on two Pesachim at the same time; a case occurred, the king and queen told their slaves to slaughter for them, and they slaughtered a goat and lamb.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The king told them to ask the queen [from which they will eat]; she told them to ask R. Gamliel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> A king and queen are easygoing (they always eat whatever they desire, so they are not Makpid about the species or its fatness), so they eat from the first (surely, they are pleased to be Menuyim on it);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If this happened to someone else, he would not eat from either (we are unsure on which he wanted to be Manuy).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>On another occasion, a [dead] Sheretz was found in the kitchen; people thought that the whole [royal] feast was Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The king told them to ask the queen; she told them to ask R. Gamliel. He asked where it was found, and was told that it was in a boiling pot. He told them to put cold water on it - it quivered (it was not dead). R. Gamliel was Metaher the entire feast.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the slave forgot...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can the slave stipulate 'the other is for <i>me</i>'? Reuven automatically acquires whatever his slave acquires!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He goes to Reuven's shepherd [who wants to help Reuven]; the shepherd gives him a kid and lamb, and stipulates that Reuven has no rights to the one that is for the slave.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven forgot...[they are exempt from Pesach Sheni].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is only if he forgot after Zerikah, for at the time of Zerikah it was possible for him to eat from it - but if he forgot before Zerikah, they must bring Pesach Sheni, for at the time of Zerikah it was impossible to eat from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa):</span> If the skins of the Pesachim of five Chaburos became mixed, and a wart was found on one of them (surely the blemish was there at the time of slaughter), all of the Pesachim are burned, and the Chaburos are exempt from Pesach Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is only if the skins became mixed after Zerikah, for at the time of Zerikah it was possible [to identify the Pasul Korban, and for the other four Chaburos] to eat from it (we will explain why all are exempt from Pesach Sheni);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But if they became mixed before Zerikah, they must bring Pesach Sheni [for at the time of Zerikah no Chaburah could eat from it].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>Version #1 holds that Abaye requires that the person remembered at the time of Zerikah [even though both Korbanos are Kesherim, we require clarity which is which] - all the more so, he requires that the skins were not mixed before Zerikah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Version #2 holds that he does not allow that the skins were mixed before Zerikah - but he would allow if the person forgot before Zerikah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since both Korbanos are Kesherim, and if he will remember later they may be eaten, and it is clear to Hash-m (i.e. there is no intrinsic Pesul), they are Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>CAN PESACH SHENI BE BROUGHT MI'SAFEK?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They are exempt from Pesach Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But one of the Chaburos (the one whose Korban has a wart) was not Yotzei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are exempt because there is no way to bring Pesach Sheni [in a way that they could eat from it. The entire coming discussion also shows why they cannot offer another Pesach Rishon even if they would have time.]</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If every Chaburah offers Pesach [Sheni], four (the ones that were already Yotzei) offer Chulin b'Azarah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they offer one Pesach [and all of them will eat it], this is Lo li'Mnuyav (the Minuy is valid only for those who were not Yotzei before)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Each could stipulate - if ours had the Mum, this is Pesach; if not, this is a Shelamim!</p></div>
