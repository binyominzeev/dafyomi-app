<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>R. AKIVA DOES NOT HOLD LIKE R. YOSI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> But what is the source that R. Akiva does not hold like R. Yosi?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> If he held like R. Yosi, surely there would be a Mishnah or Beraisa [teaching his opinion] that is Posel a Revi'i of Terumah and a Chamishi of Kodesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> May we rely on this [to say that he disagrees with R. Yosi]?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi or Rav Kahana):</span> We have an explicit proof of this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> A Keli joins Kodesh inside it [if there are pieces of Kodesh inside, even if they do not touch each other, if Tum'ah touches one of them it is as if it touched all of them], but it does not join Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Revi'i of Kodesh is Pasul; a Shelishi of Terumah is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Mishnah #1 is derived from R. Akiva's testimony:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2):</span> R. Akiva further testified that if a Tevul Yom touched part of the Soles (fine flour of a Minchah), Ketores (incense), Levonah (frankincense) or coals, he was Posel all of it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> It says that a Revi'i of Kodesh is Pasul, but not a Chamishi; a Shelishi of Terumah is Pasul, but not a Revi'i.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that Tziruf (joining) is only mid'Rabanan (Rashi - since he learns from Levonah and coals, which are not foods, they Mekabel Tum'ah only mid'Rabanan; Tosfos - these are mid'Oraisa - rather, R. Akiva adds to the law taught previously of Tziruf of ashes of Parah Adumah - its Tum'ah is mid'Rabanan).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>He argues with R. Chanin:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanin):</span> Tziruf is mid'Oraisa - "Kaf Achas" - teaches that everything in the bowl [of Ketores] is considered like one.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TUM'AH OF A SAFEK NEEDLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [R. Chanina Segan ha'Kohanim testified that] if a needle was found in [Kodesh] meat that the knife and hands are Tehorim, but the meat is Tamei (this will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If it was found in the Peresh (internal excrement), everything is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> This shows that Tum'ah of the hands (see note in Appendix) does not apply in the Mikdash!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should learn that Tum'ah of hands <i>and of Kelim</i> (i.e. mid'Rabanan Tum'ah of Kelim, e.g. that liquids Metamei Kelim) do not apply in the Mikdash!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> Tum'ah of hands was decreed before Tum'ah of Kelim (perhaps the testimony preceded the decree of Kelim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Both of them were decreed on the day of the 18 decrees!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following Posel Terumah [mid'Rabanan] ... a Sefer [Torah, Nevi'im or Kesuvim], [Stam] hands [that have not been guarded], a Tevul Yom (in Shabbos, the Gemara deletes this from the Mishnah, for it is mid'Oraisa), food or Kelim that became Tamei through liquids.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Even regarding Chulin, the knife would not be Tamei - nothing it touched could Metamei it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it touched the meat - food is not Metamei a Keli!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it touched the needle - a Keli [that is not an Av ha'Tum'ah] is not Metamei a Keli! (Therefore, we may not infer that Tum'ah of Kelim does not apply in the Mikdash.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the status of the needle?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is Safek Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Elazar or R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina taught that Chachamim did not decree about Safek spit in Yerushalayim [lest it is from a Zav, and hence an Av ha'Tum'ah]; the other taught that Chachamim did not decree about Safek Kelim in Yerushalayim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav):</span> Someone lost a needle that was Tamei Mes, and recognized it in the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yosi bar Avin):</span> The case is, the cow came muzzled from outside Yerushalayim (surely, it swallowed the needle outside - nevertheless, we are lenient like the law of Safek Kelim in Yerushalayim).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SAFEK KELIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar or R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Chachamim did not decree about Safek spit in Yerushalayim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of R. Elazar and R. Yosi):</span> Chachamim did not decree about Safek Kelim in Yerushalayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions:</span> We already know both of these from Mishnayos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Mishnah):</span> All spit in Yerushalayim is Tahor, except for the upper market (Tamei people used to gather there to avoid being Metamei Tehorim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Amora is Metaher even if we know that a Zav passed through the area where the spit was found.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Mishnah):</span> All Kelim in Yerushalayim on the path people use to descend to the Mikveh are Temei'im (we assume that the owner was taking them to immerse them and dropped them).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Kelim found anywhere else are Tehorim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - counter-question (Seifa):</span> Kelim on the path ascending from the Mikveh are Tehorim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Kelim found elsewhere are Temei'im!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> [The inferences contradict one another - the Amora needed to teach that the inference from the Reisha is correct (Safek Kelim are Tehorim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The inference of the Seifa only excludes Kelim found on a path people take to <i>and</i> from the Mikveh (such Safek Kelim are Tamei. R. Chananel - the Amora also teaches that only in Yerushalayim Safek Kelim are Tehorim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav says that the Mishnah discusses one who lost a needle that was Tamei Mes, and recognized it in the meat;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learned from "Ba'Chalal Cherev" that a sword [or any metal Keli that touched a Mes] becomes like a Mes - [mid'Oraisa,] the needle is Metamei even people and Kelim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> We must say that the Azarah is a Reshus ha'Rabim regarding Tum'ah; any Safek Tum'ah in Reshus ha'Rabim is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the Safek was in Reshus ha'Yachid, it would be Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [The knife that might have touched] the needle is Ein Bo Da'as Lish'ol (it is incapable of telling us what happened) - if such a thing became Safek Tamei, it is Tahor even in Reshus ha'Yachid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Safek arose through a person [who cut with the knife];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We ask [Beis Din; alternatively, we are stringent] about a Safek that came through a person, even regarding a Keli resting on the ground.</p></div>
