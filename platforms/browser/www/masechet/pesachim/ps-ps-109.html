<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>KEEPING CHILDREN HAPPY AND AWAKE ON PESACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> We Chotef the Matzah (eat it quickly), lest children fall asleep [before the Seder ends; alternatively - we lift the tray with the Matzah, to arouse them to ask questions, or remove the Matzah lest they become sated and fall asleep].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Akiva never said that it is time to leave the Beis Medrash except for Erev Pesach and Erev Yom Kipur:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>On Erev Pesach he left to ensure that his children will be awake at night (he forced his children to sleep during the day);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>On Erev Yom Kipur he went to feed his children.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One must gladden his children on the festivals - "V'Somachta b'Chagecha";</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>One gladdens them by giving them wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, one gives to everyone what will gladden him - wine gladdens men.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What gladdens women?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> Women in Bavel delight in colored clothing; in Eretz Yisrael they delight in ironed linen garments.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> When the Mikdash stands, Simchah is only with meat [of Shelamim] - "V'Zovachta Shelamim v'Ochalta Sham v'Somachta";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Nowadays Simchah is only with wine - "V'Yayin Yesamach Levav Enosh."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SIZE OF A REVI'IS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> There was a measure for selling Muryas (fish oil) in Tzipori - it was like a Lug of the Mikdash, it was used to measure a Revi'is (quarter Lug, for the cups of wine on Pesach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> There used to be a measure called 'Tuman' in Teverya, it exceeded the current Tuman by a Revi'is - they used it to measure a Revi'is for Pesach [by pouring its contents into the smaller Tuman and measuring what remains].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Revi'is mid'Oraisa [to Mechayev a Nazir for drinking wine, for Tum'as Ohel of blood, and the oil for certain Menachos] is the volume of a box two thumbs by two thumbs by two and seven tenths thumbs:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Rochatz ba'Mayim Es Kol Besaro" - nothing may separate between the water and the flesh of one who immerses;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Ba'Mayim" - in a Mikveh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Es Kol Besaro" - the Mikveh must contain the entire body [of an average size person].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How big is this?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">109b----------------------------------------109b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is [the volume of] an Amah by an Amah and three Amos tall (it need not have this shape) - Chachamim calculated, this is 40 Sa'im. (In note in Appendix we show how Rav Chisda's teaching follows from this.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> The Shulchan in the Mikdash [which was two Amos long, an Amah wide and one and a half Amos tall] could be dissembled - if it was solid, it could not fit into the Mikveh [in the Azarah of the above dimensions, which is] exactly an Amah wide to be immersed! (Tosfos - we do not ask from the height, which was even more than an Amah, for it was known that the legs were removable. See note in Appendix.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps it was immersed in the Yam Shel Shlomo [which was very wide]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> The Yam Shel Shlomo held 150 times [40 Sa'im,] the [minimum] volume of a Mikveh.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ZUGOS DOES NOT APPLY TO THE FOUR CUPS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They should not give to him less than four cups of wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Chachamim enact something that could be dangerous?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should not eat two things [or any even number], drink two [cups], clean himself twice [in the bathroom], or have relations twice. (These cause vulnerability to a certain evil spirit; nowadays we are not concerned for it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Pesach night is "Leil Shimurim" - it is Shamur (guarded) from Mazikim in all generations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The cup of Berachah (of Birkas ha'Mazon) joins for the good, not for harm.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> Chachamim enacted four cups in the way of freedom - each is a Mitzvah by itself (we do not consider them together).</p></div>
