<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TRANSGRESSING YOM TOV SHENI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Safra):</span> [Second day Yom Tov of Chutz la'Aretz was instituted lest people will not find out which day was fixed to be Rosh Chodesh -] in our place, we find out which day was Rosh Chodesh [via messengers of Beis Din, before Yom Tov];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In settled areas, we may not do Melachah on the day which we know is Chol, on account of strife;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>May one do Melachah in a Midbar?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba citing Rav Ami):</span> It is forbidden in a settled area, it is permitted in a Midbar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> R. Noson bar Asya went from Bei Rav (where he learned) to Pumbedisa [outside his Techum] on the second day of Shavu'os; Rav Yosef excommunicated him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Why don't you lash him?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I was more stringent - in Eretz Yisrael they vote whether or not a Talmid [who transgressed] should be lashed, but they do not vote whether or not he should be excommunicated [they are concerned for honor of the Torah - Rashi; Aruch (cited in margin) - they gather by the Rav [this shows honor to him] to vote whether or not a Talmid should be lashed, but regarding excommunication, which is for severe offenses again Hash-m, they do not gather [to honor to the Rav]).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rav Yosef lashed him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Why don't you excommunicate him - Rav and Shmuel taught that we excommunicate on account of Yom Tov Sheni of Chutz la'Aretz!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> That is for regular people - he is a Talmid, so I was more lenient - in Eretz Yisrael they vote whether or not to lash a Talmid, but not to excommunicate him.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHEMITAH PRODUCE THAT WAS TAKEN TO A DIFFERENT REGION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if one takes Shemitah produce... [R. Yehudah says, he says 'Go yourself and bring', i.e. go to my old place, and bring from there, and you can eat like me!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Doesn't R. Yehudah agree that he must be stringent like his old and new residences?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> R. Yehudah discusses a different matter:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>[The first Tana says,] or if he went from a place where it is not finished, to a place where it is not finished, and heard that it was finished in his old place, he must do Bi'ur;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he says [back to people of his old place] 'Go yourself and bring from where I did - they are still available there' [in my new place! He must observe stringencies of his old place that applied at the time he left - it was permitted when he left!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This implies that R. Yehudah is more lenient [than the first Tana] - but R. Aba taught that he is more stringent! (R. Aba had a tradition for this.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, [the first Tana says that] he need not do Bi'ur;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, [he must, for] people [of his old place] tell him 'Go yourself and [see if you could] bring [more] from where you brought them (our place) - [you could not, for] they are finished!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> The case is like the Mishnah says - he went from a place where it is not finished, to a place where it is finished, and returned them to his old place, and they are still not finished there - [the first Tana says,] he need not do Bi'ur;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, they tell him 'Go yourself and [see if you could] bring [more] from where you [most recently] brought them - they are finished'! (One must do Bi'ur there - this is a stringency of the most recent place you left.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> Does R. Yehudah say that [bringing them into a region on] the back of a donkey makes Klitah (gives them the law of that region?! Surely, it does not!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> They argue like the following Tana'im argue:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If three kinds of vegetables were pickled together in one barrel, one may eat [all of them] until one of them (R. Nisim - the first one put in the barrel, it gives taste to the others) is finished [in the field];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, he may eat [all of them] until all of them are finished [in the field - this is like the first Tana of our Mishnah];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Gamliel says, when any of the three is finished [in the field], he must Meva'er [get rid of] it from the barrel (this is like R. Yehudah);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The Halachah follows R. Gamliel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Ravina):</span> They argue like the following Tana'im argue:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may eat dates [anywhere in Yehudah] until the last dates in Tzo'ar (a city of dates) are finished (this is like the first Tana of our Mishnah)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, one may eat on account of dates left in trees between the Lulavim (animals can take them), but not on account of dates between thorns (animals cannot take them; this is like R. Yehudah).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are three regions regarding Bi'ur - Yehudah, Ever ha'Yarden and Galil;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Each of them is divided into three [sub]regions.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, there are really nine - why does it say three?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> One may eat a species of Shemitah produce until it is finished [in the field] in the last subregion in his region.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer:</span> (There are three elevations in each region - mountain, valley and plain.) One may eat a species until it is finished from his elevation in his region.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chama bar Ukva):</span> "Veli'Vhemtecha vela'Chayah Asher b'Artzecha" - as long as it is available for Chayos to eat in the field, you may [eat and] feed your animals in the house;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When it ceases for Chayos in the field, you must remove it from your house;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We have a tradition that animals in Yehudah do not go to Galil to eat or vice-versa [and surely they do not cross the river to eat from Ever ha'Yarden].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one took [Shemitah] produce from Eretz Yisrael to Chutz la'Aretz, Bi'ur is done in their [new] place [when they are finished in the place they grew];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, they must be returned to their [original] place [and Bi'ur is done there] - we learn from "b'Artzecha."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need "b'Artzecha" [for Rav Chama's teaching]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It could have said 'ba'Aretz' - rather, it says "b'Artzecha" to teach a second law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "<i>Asher</i> b'Artzecha" is extra to teach a second law.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Rav Safra took barrels of [Shemitah] wine from Eretz Yisrael to Chutz la'Aretz; he asked Rav Huna brei d'Rav Ika and Rav Kahana if R. Avahu said whether or not the Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> R. Avahu said that the Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Huna brei d'Rav Ika:</span> He said that the Halachah does not follow R. Shimon ben Elazar!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Safra:</span> We may rely on Rav Huna brei d'Rav Ika, for he is as meticulous about what he learns from his Rebbi as Rachbah of Pumbedisa is:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rachbah citing Rav Yehudah):</span> Har ha'Bayis was surrounded by a double Stav (ledges to sit on), one inside the other. (Rashi (Berachos) - he used the same word (Stav) that his Rebbi did, even though the Mishnayos use a different word.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Rav Safra illustrates "Ami b'Etzo Yish'al <i>u'Maklo Yagid</i> Lo" - he is Magid (tells his questions) to whoever is Mekil (lenient).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN DOES SHEMITAH APPLY TO FRUIT?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Ilai cut Kafniyos (small unripe dates - Rambam; Rashi - he cut the tree) in Shemitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could he do so - Shemitah produce is "L'Ochlah," not to ruin (he should have left them to ripen)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that applies only to finished produce, but not to unripe produce.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Nachman taught that Maschalei (shells over dates) of Orlah are forbidden, because they are Shomrim for fruit [hence they are considered like fruit];</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>They are Shomrim only when the dates are Kufri (unripe), and he calls them fruit!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Nachman holds like R. Yosi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> All Smadar (budding grapes) [of Orlah] are forbidden because they are fruit.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim argue with R. Yosi [and R. Ilai holds like them].</p></div>
