<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>RUCHOS ON ACCOUNT OF DRINKING OR NOT WASHING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If one does any of the following without washing his hands [afterwards], he will be afraid for the specified period, and he will not know why he is afraid:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Eating cress - he will be afraid for 30 days; letting blood - seven days; cutting his hair - three days; cutting his nails - one day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Putting one's hand on his lips near his nostrils causes fear [due to Ru'ach Ra'ah]; putting one's hand on his forehead induces sleep.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one puts food or drink under a bed, even if it is covered in an iron container, Ru'ach Ra'ah dwells on it. (Toras Chayim, brought in Gilyon ha'Shas - sleep is a taste of death, there is no Neshamah to ward of Mazikim - therefore, under the bed is like under a Mes at the time.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should not drink water on Tuesday night [without a Ner] or Shabbos night; if he does, he is responsible for his own death, from Ru'ach Ra'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one is thirsty then, what should he do?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Before drinking he should say the seven Kolos that David said over water - "Kol Hash-m Al ha'Mayim...Kol Hash-m ba'Ko'ach...";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If not, he should say 'Lul Shafan...' (an incantation suggesting to Mazikim to bother someone else).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If not - if someone else is in the house, he should wake him and tell him 'Ploni ben Plonisa (himself) is thirsty', and then drink.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If not, he should bang the cover on the jug [to make it sound like someone else is there] and then drink;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If not, he should throw something into the water, and then drink.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not drink water at night from rivers or lakes; if he does so, he is responsible for his own death;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is dangerous on account of Shavriri (a Shed that causes blindness).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one is thirsty then, what should he do?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If someone else is there, he should tell him 'Ploni ben Plonisa is thirsty', and then drink.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If not, he should say to himself 'Ploni, my mother told me to beware of Shavriri - Shavriri Briri Riri Yiri Ri (the Shed gets afraid when it hears its name reduced each time), I want to drink in a white earthenware cup!'</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MUST ANIYIM HONOR SHABBOS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [He should get four cups of wine] even if he is supported from the Tamchuy (food given daily to the poorest people).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Chidush according to R. Akiva:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva says that it is better to make one's [meals on] Shabbos like [those of] a weekday than to [begin to] receive Tzedakah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Here, for the sake of publicizing the miracle [of Yetzi'as Mitzrayim by drinking the four cups], one should [even begin to] take Tzedakah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'vei Eliyahu):</span> Even though R. Akiva says that it is better to make one's Shabbos like Chol than to receive Tzedakah, one should do a small matter to honor Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this small matter?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Kisa d'Harsena (fish fried in its own oil with flour):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah ben Teima):</span> Make yourself brazen like a leopard, be swift like an eagle [or vulture], run like a deer and be vigorous like a lion to do Hash-m's will. (It is brazen for one who is so poor to splurge for Kisa d'Harsena.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ADVICE OF CHACHAMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Akiva commanded his son R. Yehoshua seven things:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do not sit and learn at the top of the city (many people will pass by and interrupt you);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Do not live in a city run by Chachamim (they are too involved with learning to supervise the city);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Do not enter you own house suddenly [unannounced, lest people are engaged in something requiring privacy] - all the more so, another's house;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Do not go barefoot (this is disgraceful for a Chacham);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Eat early in the morning in summer, before it is too hot, and early in winter, on account of the cold (Chachamim normally eat at six hours of the day - perhaps this is only in spring and fall, when it does not get too hot or cold. Alternatively, they eat six hours from when they rise - rise very early, so you can eat [six hours later] when it is not so late);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Make Shabbos like Chol [if you must], but do not take Tzedakah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>Have financial dealings with someone who is prospering.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> He does not mean to buy from or sell to him (the one who is prospering would get the better of the deal), rather, to make a partnership.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>[Logically, we would have thought this - however,] we have a source that it is good even to buy from or sell to him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak) Question:</span> What does it mean "Ma'ase Yadav Berachta"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Anyone who received a Perutah from Iyov was blessed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>When R. Akiva was imprisoned, he commanded R. Shimon [one of his Talmidim] five things;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon asked R. Akiva to teach him; R. Akiva refused [because he was imprisoned for teaching Torah]. R. Shimon threatened to have his father inform on him to the government.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> The cow wants to nurse more than the calf wants to suckle (I want to teach more than you want to learn)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> [Only] the calf  (me) is in danger (nothing more will happen to you)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> If you want people to heed you, say [teachings] in the name of a great Chacham;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Teach your son from a Sefer that has been proofread;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is [the wisdom behind] this?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A mistake at the beginning of one's learning will remain.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Do not cook in a pot that someone else cooked in.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It refers to [marrying] a divorcee while her ex-husband is alive;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>It was taught that if a man who divorced remarried a divorcee, each of them thinks about their prior spouse [at the time of relations - this is bad for the children that result].</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It even refers to a widow - perhaps she will not enjoy intimacy with him as much as with her first husband.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">112b----------------------------------------112b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>If you want to do a Mitzvah and gain, lend money [and take the land as collateral; each year you deduct a small amount from the loan,] and eat the produce;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>If you want to do a Mitzvah and be Tahor, marry a woman even if you already have children (it will protect you from nocturnal emissions).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rebbi commanded his sons four things:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do not live in Shachnetziv, for the residents are scoffers, and you will be drawn after them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Do not sit on the bed of a Nochris;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> This means, do not sleep [like Nochrim] without saying Kri'as Shma;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> It means, do not marry a convert.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #3:</span> It literally means, do not sit on the bed of a Nochris, because of an incident with Rav Papa (a Nochris invited Rav Papa to sit on a bed; there was a dead baby underneath, she sought to blame him for killing it. Rashi's version - he sat, and he had to flee on account of her accusation.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Do not evade taxes - perhaps they will discover what you really have, and they will take everything;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Do not stand in front of an ox when it leaves the swamp, for then the Satan tempts it to gore.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel):</span> This refers to a black ox in Nisan (winter is over, it sees vegetation all around and becomes bold).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> One should distance himself 50 Amos from a Tam ox (not established to gore), and as far as one can see from a Mu'ad (established gorer).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> [Even] if a bull is eating from its basket, go up to the roof and throw down the ladder (i.e. do not go down while it is around - we are not really concerned that it will climb the ladder).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>One snarls 'Hen Hen' at an ox [to stop it from goring or to make it work]; one snarls 'Zeh Zeh' at a lion, and 'Da Da' at a camel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The sing-song for a boat [to induce people to pull well] is 'Hilni Hiya Hila v'Hilak Hulya'. (Meshech Chachmah Shemos 12:21 (uv'Derech) - animals respond to repetitions of a simple sound, but people are aroused by variety - therefore, one can overcome [animalistic] lusts with repetitions of a single ethical teaching, but to straighten out one's mindset requires great critique.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> All of the following [sometimes] make one prone to Tzara'as (these will be explained) - hide, fish, Kos, hot water, eggs, and white lice:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>These situations lead to Tzara'as - sleeping on a hide that was not fully tanned, eating Shibuta (a certain fish) in Nisan, eating remnants of KiSa d'Harsena, (fish fried in its own oil with flour), regularly pouring overly hot water over oneself, walking on egg shells, and wearing laundered clothing without waiting eight days - lice return to him with vigor [and bite].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Papa):</span> One should not enter a house with a cat when barefoot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Cats kill and eat snakes, which have small bones [which they leave on the floor] - if a small bone enters one's foot, it will not leave - this is dangerous.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> One should not enter a house without a cat when it is dark.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Snakes may be there -] perhaps a snake will wrap itself around his foot and he will not notice, and he will be in danger.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi commanded three things to Rebbi (R. Chananel's text reads Rav - R. Yishmael sat like a Talmid in front of Rebbi, it is unlikely that he would command him):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do not blemish yourself.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Do not have a litigation against three people - perhaps [they will get angry, and] two will [falsely] testify that you owe money to the third [alone, and they will share the money].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Do not look at an item as if you want to buy it when you have no money (this deters potential buyers from looking at it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Do not have relations with your wife the first night after she immersed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This refers to a Nidah mid'Oraisa (if she saw blood on the seventh day of Nidah and immersed that night; nowadays, Benos Yisrael count seven clean days after any sighting before immersing);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since her source of blood is open, we are concerned lest she continue to see.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah commanded Rebbi three things:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do not go out alone at night; do not stand naked in front of a Ner; do not enter a new bathhouse, lest the floor cave in (there is fire or water below).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long should one wait before entering?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> One should wait 12 months.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who stands naked in front of a Ner will get epilepsy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>If one has relations in front of a lamp, the resulting child will have epilepsy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one has relations on a bed on which a child sleeps, the child will get epilepsy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is a problem only if the child is less than one year old, is sleeping towards your legs, and you did not put your hand on him.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>A SHED THAT WAS BANNED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should not go out alone on Tuesday night or Shabbos night, for then Igeres Bas Machalas (a Shed) and 180,000 Mazikim go out; each has its own permission to strike.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>At first, they were common every night; once, Igeres encountered R. Chanina ben Dosa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Igeres:</span> Had they not announced in Shomayim not to harm you and your Torah, I would have struck you!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> If I am so important in Shomayim, I decree upon you never to go in settled areas!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Igeres:</span> Please leave me some time!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>He allowed her to go on Tuesday night and Shabbos night. (people may not travel on Shabbos; Tosfos Rid explains why villagers who went to cities and returned would not travel on Tuesday night.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Igeres encountered Abaye, and told him 'Had they not announced in Shomayim not to harm you and your Torah, I would have struck you!' Abaye decreed that she never go in settled areas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we see that she goes [with her escorts]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When they go in paths through vineyards, their horses flee to settled areas, and they come to retrieve them.</p></div>
