<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>FROM WHICH CAMPS IS A BA'AL KERI SENT?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> A Bo'el Nidah is like a Tamei Mes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what way are they the same?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This refers to his Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Verses explicitly Metamei both of them for seven days!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It refers to which Machanos he must leave.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Since the Seifa refers to Machanos, also the Reisha!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No - the Seifa refers to Machanos, but the Reisha refers to Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A Metzora is more stringent than a Zav, and a Zav is more stringent than a Tamei Mes - this excludes a Ba'al Keri, who is more lenient than a Tamei Mes (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means, we exclude a Ba'al Keri from being [sent out of two camps] like a Zav, and he is like a Tamei Mes, since even a Tamei Mes, who is more stringent, [is sent out of only one, and] is permitted in Machaneh Levi!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No - he leaves the camp [restrictions] of a Tamei Mes, and enters the camp of a Zav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though a Tamei Mes, who is more stringent, is permitted in Machaneh Levi, a Ba'al Keri is like a Zav (their Tum'ah came from their bodies, therefore they are the same regarding Machanos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(A recitor of Beraisos):</span> [Regarding a Ba'al Keri it says] "Va'Yatza El mi'Chutz la'Machaneh" - this refers to Machaneh Shechinah; "Lo Yavo El Toch ha'Machaneh" - this refers to Machaneh Levi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This teaches that a Ba'al Keri is expelled from two camps.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 Question (R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> [Your Beraisa expounds that] he may not enter [Machaneh Levi] - he is not yet outside [the verse only expelled him from Machaneh Shechinah so far]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 Question (R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> [It expounds that] he may not enter [Machaneh Levi] before teaching that he must leave! (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> Rather, it should say "[V'Yatza El] mi'Chutz la'Machaneh" - this is Machaneh Levi; [when he leaves,] "Lo Yavo El Toch ha'Machaneh" - Machaneh Shechinah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> We should say that both of them refer to Machaneh Shechinah - the verse teaches that he transgresses a Lav and an Ase for entering!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it would have said only "Va'Yatza El mi'Chutz la'Machaneh v'Lo Yavo El Toch"; "ha'Machaneh" is extra, to forbid another Machaneh.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MICHUY OF THE INNARDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Michuy of the innards [is not Docheh Shabbos].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> It is piercing them with a knife [to allow the excrement to leave].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chiya bar Rav):</span> It is foul liquid stuck to them that is scraped off with a knife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chiya's source?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> He learns from "V'Charvos <i>Mechim</i> Garim Yochelu."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Tzadikim will inherit the property of Resha'im (this teaches that Mechim refers to something detested).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Menasiya bar Yirmeyah):</span> "V'Ra'u Kevasim <i>k'DaVRaM</i>" - k'MeDuBaR BaM (like was said about them).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was said about them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> [The end of the verse,] "V'Charvos Mechim Garim Yochelu" (Tzadikim will inherit their property).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Had it said 'Charvos', I would agree - but "<i>V</i>'Charvos" discusses a new matter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It teaches like Rav Chananel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chananel):</span> In the future, Tzadikim will revive the dead - it says "V'Ra'u Kevasim k'Davram," and it says "Yir'u Vashan v'Gil'ad ki'Mei Olam" (alluding to people who revived the dead):</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Vashan" refers to Elisha, who was from Bashan - it says "V'Yanai v'Shofot ba'Bashan" and "...Po Elisha ben Shofot";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>"V'Gil'ad" refers to Eliyahu - "Eliyahu ha'Tishbi mi'Yoshvei Gil'ad."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> In the future, Tzadikim will revive the dead - it says "...Od Yeshvu Zekenim...v'Ish Mish'anto b'Yado," like it says "V'Somti Mish'anti Al Pnei ha'Na'ar" (to revive him).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Ula):</span> It says "Bila ha'Maves la'Netzach," and it says "Ha'Na'ar Ben Me'ah Shanah Yamus"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Death will cease from Yisrael, Nochrim will live long lives [but not forever].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Will Nochrim be in the world to come?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes, They will be there to serve us - "V'Omdu Zarim v'Ra'u Tzonchem...."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Chisda):</span> It says "V'Chofrah ha'Levanah u'Voshah ha'Chamah" (they will not illuminate; Rashi in Sanhedrin - they will be dim), and it says "V'Hayah Or ha'Levanah k'Or ha'Chamah...Shiv'asayim k'Or Shiv'as ha'Yomim"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #1:</span> In the Messianic period they will be bright, but not in the world to come (the radiance of the Shechinah will illuminate).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Shmuel, who says that the only difference between this world and Yemos ha'Moshi'ach is that the kingdoms will cease to rule over Yisrael, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> Both refer to the world to come - in the place of Tzadikim they will be bright, but not in the place of the Shechinah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> It says "Ani Amis va'Achayeh" and it "says Machatzti va'Ani Erpa" - since Hash-m can revive the dead, it need not say that He can heal!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It teaches that just like the same people who were struck are healed, the same people who died come back to life.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> "Ani Amis va'Achayeh" - perhaps this is as we find in this world, people die and others are sustained!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rejection "Machatzti va'Ani Erpa" - just as the sick are cured, also the dead will be revived;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This refutes those who say that there is no source in Torah for Techiyas ha'Mesim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> First Hash-m will revive people the way He killed them; then, He will heal what He struck.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Haktaras ha'Chelev [is Docheh].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> This shows the dearness of a Mitzvah in its time! Chelev and limbs of a Korban [whose blood was thrown during the day] may be offered all night, nevertheless [we offer them on Shabbos,] we do not wait for Motza'ei Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Carrying it and bringing it [...and cutting a wart off it are not Docheh].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #2):</span> [On Shabbos] one may cut off a wart [from a Kohen or Korban - it is a Mum until it is removed] in the Mikdash, but not outside the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (R. Elazar or R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Both Mishnayos discuss cutting it off by hand - one may cut off a dry wart in the Mikdash, a wet one is forbidden.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #2 (The other of R. Elazar and R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Both discuss moist warts - one may cut it off by hand (this is only Shevus, for is an unskillful way to cut it), but it is forbidden with a Keli;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the second opinion answer like the first?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that Mishnah #2 cannot discuss a dry wart, for it merely crumbles (Rashi - the Tana would not call it 'cutting'; Tosfos - it does not resemble Melachah, surely it would be permitted even with a Keli).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the first opinion answer like the second?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mishnah #2 already forbids with a Keli everywhere (it need not be repeated in our Mishnah)!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>This is as R. Yehoshua holds elsewhere, that Simchah [of eating] on Yom Tov is a Mitzvah [mid'Oraisa]:</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that anyone who eats on the ninth is considered as if he fasted on the ninth and 10th (Sha'arei Teshuvah 4:8 - he shows joy that the time for atonement is coming, testifying to his anxiety over his sins).</p></div>
