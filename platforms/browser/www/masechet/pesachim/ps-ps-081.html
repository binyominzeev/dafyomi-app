<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> If slaughter and Zerikah [of Pesach] were done for a Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom (see note in Appendix) [after she immersed] on the day after she saw blood, and she saw blood later that day, she may not eat Pesach at night, but she is exempt from Pesach Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He holds that the Tzitz is Meratzeh [for Tum'as Zivah]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> No, he holds that she is not Teme'ah retroactively [so she was Tehorah at the time of Zerikah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He holds that she is Teme'ah retroactively!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> If slaughter and Zerikah [of Pesach] were done for a Zav [who has seen two emissions, after he immersed] on the seventh [clean] day, and for a Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom on her second day (the day after she saw blood), and each had a sighting later that day:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Even though they retroactively Metamei [to be an Av ha'Tum'ah] Mishkav and Moshav, they are exempt from Pesach Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The retroactive Tumah is mid'Rabanan (mid'Oraisa, they are Temei'im only from the time they see).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Oshiya also holds that the retroactive Tumah is mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> If a Zav had an emission on [what would have been] his seventh [clean] day, it is Soser (wipes out the days he counted, he must start counting seven clean days from the beginning);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is Soser only the seventh day itself!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is illogical! If it nullifies the day, it should nullify the entire count; if not, the count should be complete!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Yochanan says that even the seventh day counts.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Oshaya:</span> R. Yosi holds like you.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yosi said that they retroactively Metamei Mishkav and Moshav!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that the retroactive Tumah is mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Tum'as ha'Tehom does not apply to Zivah - if so, what do we exclude from '[Tum'as ha'Tehom is Meratzeh] only regarding Tum'as Mes' [in R. Chiya's Beraisa (80B)]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must answer like Rava [above] - it excludes Tum'as ha'Tehom of the Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and answer to Objection 3:l:7, 80B):</span> Really, it discusses Tum'ah of the owner regarding Pesach - the Tana holds that we do not slaughter and Zorek for one who is Tamei Sheretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (R. Yosi holds that mid'Oraisa, the Tum'ah is not retroactive - this is because part (even a moment, at the beginning or end) of the second day before she saw counts like a full day of Shimur, so the next sighting starts a new Zivah.) According to R. Yosi, how can a woman become a full Zavah [so that three days of blood will be considered consecutive]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> She spurted blood continuously [from day one until day three].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Answer #2 She saw all of Bein ha'Shemashos on two consecutive days (this includes the last moment of day and the first moment of night, i.e. she saw on days two and three before even a moment of Shimur).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR TUM'AS HA'TEHOM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Is Tum'as ha'Tehom permitted to a Kohen offering the Tamid? (If we learn that he was Nitma Tum'as ha'Tehom, may he offer it, even though there are Tahor Kohanim?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If you will say that it is permitted to a Kohen offering Korbanos [Nazir or Pesach], perhaps it is a tradition only regarding Nazir and Pesach - or, perhaps we learn to the Tamid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> We learn from a Kal va'Chomer - Tum'as ha'Tehom is permitted even where known Tum'ah is not (Nazir or a Tamei individual regarding Pesach) - all the more so it is permitted where known Tum'ah is permitted (the Tamid, if there are no Tehorim to offer it)!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">81b----------------------------------------81b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We may not learn from [a Kal va'Chomer from] a tradition from Sinai!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer (to R. Akiva)):</span> [The Tum'ah of] a bone the size of a barley seed is a tradition from Sinai - you cannot learn a Kal va'Chomer to a Revi'is of blood (that its Tum'ah is Soser Nezirus) from a tradition!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "B'Mo'ado-B'Mo'ado" from Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Tum'as ha'Tehom [regarding Nazir and Pesach? This was asked before Rav Yosef's question - he already knew the conclusion, that it is a tradition.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> [Regarding Nazir it says] "V'Chi Yamus Mes <i>Alav</i>" - the Tum'ah was clear to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This answers regarding Nazir - what is the source for Pesach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> "V'Derech Rechokah <i>Lachem</i>" - [also Tum'ah must be] clear to you.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Reish Lakish):</span> Tum'ah must be like a Derech (road), i.e. exposed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Refutation (of all of them - Beraisa):</span> Tum'as ha'Tehom is one which was not known to anyone in the world.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Elazar says that if the Tum'ah was not clear to the one that became Tamei, it is Tum'as ha'Tehom;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yochanan says that if the Tum'ah was not clear 'Lachem' [to at least two people], it is Tum'as ha'Tehom;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Reish Lakish says that any Tum'ah not clear to everyone [like a road] is Tum'as ha'Tehom!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Tum'as ha'Tehom is a tradition - the verses brought are mere Asmachtos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN DOES TUM'AS HA'TEHOM APPLY?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> There is Ritzuy for Tum'as ha'Tehom only if he found out after Zerikah, but not if he found out beforehand.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa):</span> One who finds a [previously unknown] corpse [underneath and] lying across the width of a path [on which he walked] is Tamei regarding Terumah, but Tahor regarding Pesach and Nezirus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tamei and Tahor refer to the future [even if he found out before Zerikah, Zerikah may be done]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rather, Mar bar Rav Ashi taught that Ritzuy for Tum'as ha'Tehom is not only if he found out after Zerikah - rather, even if he found out beforehand it is Meratzeh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who finds a corpse across the width of a path is Tamei regarding Terumah, but Tahor regarding Pesach and Nezirus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This is only if there is no room to pass without touching, moving or towering above the Mes - if not, [this is Safek Tum'ah in Reshus ha'Rabim,] he is Tahor even regarding Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This is only if the Mes is intact - but if it was in pieces, he is Tahor - perhaps he passed between the pieces.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is if it is not in a grave - a grave joins the pieces inside, it is as if the Mes is intact.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This is (Gra - the last two leniencies are) only if he walked [without a load], but if he carried a load or rode, he is Tamei - one who walks can avoid touching or towering above the Mes, but one who carries a load or rides cannot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>This is only regarding Tum'as ha'Tehom - but regarding a known Tum'ah he is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tum'as ha'Tehom is one which was not known to anyone in the world.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>If the Mes was found covered in straw, dirt or pebbles, it is Tum'as ha'Tehom (no one can see it - perhaps a mound fell on the person, and no one ever knew);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>If it was found in water, even in cracks between rocks, it is not Tum'as ha'Tehom, for one who looks can see it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>The law of Tum'as ha'Tehom only applies to [Tum'as] Mes.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>HOW WE BURN TAMEI AND NOSAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the entire Pesach or most of it became Tamei, it is burned in front of the Mikdash using wood of (i.e. intended for) the Ma'arachah (fire on the Mizbe'ach. The wood is Hukdash on this condition, so there will not be Me'ilah);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Nosar [of a Tahor Pesach] or a Tamei minority of a Pesach is burned in the Chatzeros or on the roofs of the Benei Chaburah, using their own wood;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Stingy people burn it in front of the Mikdash in order to benefit from Etzei ha'Ma'arachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the reason [to burn it in the Mikdash using Etzei ha'Ma'arachah when the majority became Tamei]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> This is to embarrass the Chaburah [for not being more careful.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Tamei minority...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if one left Yerushalayim and remembered that he is carrying Kodesh meat (it is now Pasul):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he already passed Tzofim (from where one can see the Mikdash), he burns it where he is;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If not, he returns to burn it in front of the Mikdash from Etzei ha'Ma'arachah.</p></div>
