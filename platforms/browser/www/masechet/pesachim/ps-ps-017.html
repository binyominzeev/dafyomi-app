<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CHAGAI TESTED THE KOHANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "...Besar Kodesh bi'Chnaf Bigdo v'Noga bi'Chnafo El ha'Lechem v'El ha'Nazid v'El ha'Yayin v'El ha'Shemen v'El Kol Ma'achal ha'Yikdash va'Ya'anu ha'Kohanim va'Yomru Lo" (Chagai tested Kohanim about how many degrees of Tum'as Ochlim apply to Kodshim; they said that the last food is Tahor).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav said that the Kohanim erred (really, the last food becomes Tamei through the oil)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This question is only against Rav - Rav's text [of the Mishnah of Yosi ben Yo'ezer] is Metaher [blood and water, the] 'liquids of Beis <i>Mitbechai</i>' (where Korbanos are rinsed);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that Tum'ah applies to [wine and oil,] liquids of Beis <i>Midbechai</i>' (the Mizbe'ach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Kohanim erred.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They did not err.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rav holds that they erred - Chagai asked whether or not a Revi'i is Tamei regarding Kodesh, and they said no;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Shmuel holds that they did not err - Chagai asked whether or not a Chamishi is Tamei regarding Kodesh, and they said no.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand according to Rav - he asked about a Revi'i:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> A Sheretz touched bread (1), which then touched porridge (2), which then touched wine (3), which then touched oil or any food (4);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> A Sheretz touched a garment (1), which touched bread or porridge (2), which then touched wine or oil (3), which then touched any food (4); (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>How does Shmuel derive that he asked about a Chamishi?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It does not say that Kenafo (Rashi - the Sheretz; Tosfos - the garment) touched the bread, rather, <i>bi</i>'Chnafo (something that touched Kenafo - therefore, the foods were one level more removed than Rav said).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yomer Chagai Im Yiga Temei Nefesh b'Chol Eleh ha'Yitma (if these foods will become Temei'im through a Tamei Mes (an Av ha'Tum'ah)) va'Ya'anu ha'Kohanim va'Yomru Yitma" - this is good according to Shmuel, also here the Kohanim answered correctly (a Revi'i of Kodesh is Tamei);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But according to Rav, both questions were about a Revi'i - why did they err about the Sheretz and not about a Tamei Mes?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> They were proficient in laws of Tum'as Mes, but not about laws of a Sheretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> Above he asked about a Revi'i; here, he asked about a Shelishi. (Rashi - a Mes itself touched the bread, it became an 'Av' (to make a Rishon); Tosfos - the bread became a Rishon).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Ya'an Chagai va'Yomer Ken ha'Am ha'Zeh...[v'Chen Kol Ma'ase Yedeihem va'Asher Yakrivu Shamir Tamei Hu" - we understand according to Rav, because they erred he said that their offerings are Temei'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But according to Shmuel, they answered correctly - why did he say this?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This was said in astonishment - [since they are so proficient,] are all their offerings Temei'im?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But it says "<i>V'Chen</i>" [connoting that this is really true]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar Zutra or Rav Ashi):</span> Since their deeds were corrupt, the verse says that their offerings were Temei'im.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE TEXT OF THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav's text [of the Mishnah of Yosi ben Yo'ezer] is Metaher 'liquids of Beis <i>Mitbechai</i>' (blood and water);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Levi's text says 'liquids of Beis <i>Midbechai</i>' (even wine and oil).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand if Levi holds like Shmuel, who says that they do not Metamei other things, but they themselves can become Tamei - we can say that Chagai asked if each of these foods <i>themselves</i> touch a Rishon, if they become Nifsalim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But if he holds like Rav, who says that even they themselves are Tehorim - how can he answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that he holds like Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Shmuel's text was 'Mitbechai', like Rav's, but other liquids of Beis Midbechai can Metamei, we understand that a Revi'i does not make a Chamishi, but a Shelishi makes a Revi'i;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But if his text was 'Midbechai', like Levi's, why did Chagai ask whether or not a Revi'i makes a Chamishi - since these liquids cannot Metamei, they cannot make even a Sheni or Shelishi!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that he had the same text as Rav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Levi - Beraisa #1):</span> If blood, wine, oil, or water, i.e. a liquid of Beis Midbechai, became Tamei (Nifsal) inside [the Mikdash] and was taken outside, it is Tahor (cannot Metamei - we know from Chagai that it itself is Tamei);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it became Tamei outside and was taken inside, it is Metamei (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught that liquids of Beis Midbechai are Tehorim only in their place!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This excludes if they became Tamei inside and were taken outside!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it excludes if they became Tamei outside and were taken inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But he said [that they are Tehorim only] in their place [and now they are in their place]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means that they are Tehorim only if they became Temei'im in their place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rav - Beraisa #2):</span> If blood or water, i.e. a liquid of Beis Mitbechai, became Tamei (i.e. touched Tum'ah), whether in a Keli or in the ground, it is Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>R. Shimon says, if it became Tamei in a Keli it is Tamei (he holds that Tum'ah of liquids is mid'Oraisa - 16A); if it was in the ground, it is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE TUM'AH OF LIQUIDS MID'ORAISA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Even according to the opinion that Tum'ah of liquids is mid'Oraisa, there is a tradition from Moshe from Sinai to Metaher liquids of Beis Mitbechai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Noson):</span> But R. Elazar said that [mid'Oraisa,] liquids are not Tamei at all - we know this because Yosi ben R. Yo'ezer testified that Ayil Kamtza is permitted and that liquids of Beis Mitbechai are Tahor!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We may not learn from a tradition from Sinai [to other liquids! What is R. Elazar's proof - perhaps other liquids are Temei'im, and the tradition is Metaher liquids of Beis Mitbechai!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Ravina - Beraisa #3 - R. Yosi and R. Shimon):</span> Kelim [that doubtfully became Temei'im through liquids] are Tehorim; food [that doubtfully became Tamei through liquids] is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that R. Shimon holds that Tum'ah of liquids is mid'Oraisa - yet in Beraisa #2 he is Metaher liquids in the ground;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is a tradition from Sinai, why do we distinguish liquids in the ground from liquids in Kelim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> R. Shimon is Metaher water in the ground, but not blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He is Metaher water in the ground only if there is a Revi'is, for [mid'Oraisa] it is a valid Mikveh to immerse needles and forks [or other small Kelim, and it says "Mikve Mayim Yihyeh Tahor"] - but less than a Revi'is can become Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Liquids are Tamei in every respect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This shows that he holds that liquids can Metamei Kelim mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a Keli has an outside and an inside, such as pillows, blankets and sacks, if the inside became Tamei, the outside is also Tamei; if the outside became Tamei, the inside is not Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, this is if it was Nitma by liquids - but if a Sheretz was Metamei it, either way both become Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If liquids can Metamei Kelim mid'Oraisa, why are they different than a Sheretz?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Yehudah retracted [from saying that they are Tamei in every respect].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> He did not retract - the Beraisa discusses a liquid Nitma by a Sheretz, the Mishnah discusses a liquid Nitma by hands [which is only mid'Rabanan].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> This is if it was Nitma by liquids - but if a Sheretz was Metamei it, either way both become Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He should distinguish within liquids themselves - this [distinction between the inside and outside] applies to a liquid Nitma by hands - but if it was Nitma by a Sheretz, either way both become Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that he retracted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did he retract only regarding Kelim, but regarding food he holds like R. Yosi and R. Shimon [that liquids Metamei food mid'Oraisa] - or did he totally retract to hold like R. Meir?</p></div>
