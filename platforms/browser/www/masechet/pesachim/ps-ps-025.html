<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> This is not a stringency of Kil'ai ha'Kerem - once we show that Basar v'Chalav is Asur b'Hana'ah, one is lashed for abnormal benefit, since the Isur was not expressed regarding eating! (Maharam Chalavah - one cannot be truly lashed for abnormal benefit from Basar v'Chalav, since it is learned from a Kal va'Chomer - 'lashes' merely refers to an Isur mid'Oraisa.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The one who asked holds that since one source we learn from is Neveilah (really, Tereifah), for which one is lashed only for normal benefit, therefore the same applies to Basar v'Chalav;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Abaye says that this is why the Torah did not express the Isur of Basar v'Chalav regarding eating [in order to Mechayev for abnormal benefit]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should not be able to learn from Kil'ai ha'Kerem, for it never was permitted (when Heter (something permitted) starts to grow in a situation of Kil'ayim, the Heter remains permitted, and all new growth was forbidden from its inception)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> This teaches that the roots of Kil'ai ha'Kerem become forbidden [even though they were permitted before they grew in the vineyard]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shemayah - Mishnah):</span> If one passes a flowerpot with holes through a vineyard:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If what is growing in the pot grew another one part in 200 [while passing through], it is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it did not grow more, it is permitted! (The roots remain permitted, the new growth is Batel; also in the Reisha, the roots are inherently permitted - the plant is forbidden because there is too much Isur, it is not Batel.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava) Contradiction:</span> One verse forbids Ha'Zera (what was planted), and another forbids only "ha'Mele'ah" (additional growth)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> If it was Kil'ayim when planted, it is forbidden once it takes root [even though the seeds were permitted];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was planted b'Heter, and later grew in a situation of Kil'ayim, it is forbidden only if it grew another one part in 200.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HEALING WITH ISURIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yakov citing R. Yochanan):</span> One may use anything to heal, except for wood of an Asheirah (the cure requires an Asheirah);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there is [mortal] danger, even wood of an Asheirah should be permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If there is no danger, all Isurim should be forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is danger - nevertheless, wood of an Asheirah is forbidden:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer) Question:</span> ["V'Ohavta Es Hash-m Elokecha" -] why must it say both "Uv'Chol Nafshecha," and "Uv'Chol Me'odecha"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Even] if a person's life is dearer to him than his money, he must love Hash-m with all his life (use of idolatry contradicts love of Hash-m); [even] if his money is dearer to him than his life, he must love Hash-m with all his money (use all of it to avoid transgressing, if necessary).</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi) Question:</span> "Ki ka'Asher...u'Rtzacho Nefesh" - we do not learn about Na'arah Me'orasah (an engaged virgin who was raped) from murder (it explicitly says that we do not kill her, for she was forced)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse seems to learn Na'arah Me'orasah from a murderer, but really, Na'arah Me'orasah teaches about murder;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i..</span><p>It equates them - just like one can kill one who seeks to rape a Na'arah Me'orasah to save her, one can kill a pursuer [who seeks to kill] to save the victim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Also, just like one cannot kill someone else, even if he will be killed for refusing, also one must be killed and not transgress with a Na'arah Me'orasah.</p></div>
