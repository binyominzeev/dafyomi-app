<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THINGS HASH-M DOES NOT PUBLICIZE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Veli'Mchaseh Asik"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> This is one who covers things that Asik Yomin (the Ancient One, i.e. Hash-m) covers up, i.e. secrets of Torah (e.g. explanations of Hash-m's name, which may be revealed only to people with great Yir'as Shomayim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer:</span> This is one who reveals things that Hash-m covers up, i.e. Ta'amei Torah (reasons for Mitzvos)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana) Question:</span> How do we explain "<i>La'Mnatze'ach</i> Mizmor l'David"? (Hash-m causes others to win. The reference to Tehilim 4 is wrong, it should say Tehilim 13 (or 19 or 20...).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sing to the One who is happy when He is 'defeated'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Hash-m's ways are unlike the ways of people - people are sad when they are defeated, but Hash-m is happy when He is 'defeated' - "Va'Yomer Lehashmidem Lulei Moshe Vechiro Omad ba'Peretz Lefanav."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana or Reish Lakish) Question:</span> It says "<i>Vi'Dei</i> Adam mi'Tachas Kanfeihem" - it is written "Yado"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to Hash-m's hand, it is under the wings of the Chayos (a class of angels), in order to receive Teshuvah of penitents out of 'sight' of Midas ha'Din (the attribute of judgment, which would protest).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE WEALTH OF THE WORLD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Yosef gathered all gold and silver of the world to Mitzrayim - "Va'Ylaket Yosef Es Kol ha'Kesef ha'Nimtza;"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse only mentions the money "V'Eretz Mitzrayim uv'Eretz Kena'an" - what is the source for money elsewhere?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Chol ha'Aretz Ba'u Mitzraymah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>When Yisrael left Mitzrayim, they took it with them - "Va'Ynatzlu Es Mitzrayim;"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Yisrael emptied out Mitzrayim like a Metzudah (trap) without grain (to attract birds);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> They emptied Mitzrayim like the Metzulah (depths) is empty of fish.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>All the wealth was with Yisrael, until the days of Rechav'am, when Shishak Melech Mitzrayim took it back - "...Alah Shishak...; Va'Yikach Es Otzros Beis Hash-m...v'Es Otzros Beis ha'Melech;" Zorach Melech Kush took it from Shishak; Asa [Melech Yehudah] took it from Zorach, and sent it to Hadrimon [Melech Aram, to induce him to help Asa in his war with Basha Melech Yisrael];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The nation of Amon took it from Hadrimon, Yehoshafat [Melech Yehudah] took it from Amon - it was in Yehudah until the days of Achaz. Sancheriv took it from Achaz, and Chizkiyahu took it from Sancheriv [when Sancheriv came to attack Yerushalayim and Hash-m killed his massive army];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>It was in Yehudah until Bavel took it from Tzidkiyahu [at the time of the Churban]; the Persians took it from Bavel, the Yevanim (Greeks) took it from them, and Romi took it from Yavan; today it is still in Romi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Yosef hid three treasures in Mitzrayim - one was revealed to Korach, one to Antoninus (the Roman emperor who learned from Rebbi), and one is intact for Tzadikim in the future.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Osher Shamur li'V'alav l'Ra'aso" - this refers to Korach's wealth:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "V'Es Kol ha'Yakum Asher b'Ragleihem" - this refers to a person's money, which stands him on his feet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> Three hundred mules were needed to carry the keys to Korach's treasure houses, even though the keys and locks were leather [and very light].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE LAST VERSES OF HALLEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "David said Odcha Ki Anisani...;" Yishai said "Even Ma'asu ha'Bonim Haysah l'Rosh Pinah" (no one expected David to be anointed); his brothers said "Me'Es Hash-m Haysah Zos...;" Shmuel said "Zeh ha'Yom Asah Hash-m...;"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>"His brothers said Ana Hash-m Hoshi'ah Na;" David said "Ana Hash-m Hatzlichah Na;" Yishai said "Baruch ha'Ba b'Shem Hash-m;" Shmuel said "Berachnuchem mi'Beis Hash-m;"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>All of them said "Kel Hash-m va'Ya'er Lanu;" Shmuel said "Isru Chag ba'Avosim...;" David said "Keli Atah v'Odeka;" all of them said "Elokai Aromemeka."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should follow the local custom, whether it is to say each verse of Hallel twice, or to say it only once, and whether or not to bless afterwards.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">119b----------------------------------------119b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This refers only to afterwards, but it is a Mitzvah to bless beforehand:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> On all Mitzvos we bless Over (before) doing them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that 'Over' means before?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> "Va'Yaratz Achima'atz va'Ya'avor Es ha'Kushi."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> "V'Hu Avar Lifneihem."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "Va'Ya'avor Malkam Lifneihem va'Shem b'Rosham."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Rebbi doubled part [after "Baruch ha'Ba..."]; R. Elazar ben Parta added.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did he add?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He doubled more, starting from "Odcha Ki Anisani."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Avira) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Va'Yigdal ha'Yeled va'Yigamel"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the future Hash-m will make a feast for Tzadikim on the day that Yigamel (He will bestow) Chesed to Yitzchak's descendants. After the meal, they offer a cup to Avraham [to lead Birkas ha'Mazon] - he declines because [he feels unworthy, since] he fathered Yishmael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They offer it to Yitzchak - he declines because he fathered Esav; Yakov declines because he married two sisters in each other's lifetime, which would later be forbidden to Yisrael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Moshe declines because he did not merit to enter Eretz Yisrael; even after his death; Yehoshua declines because he did not merit to have a son;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Yehoshua bin Nun" - the lineage stops here, because he did not have a son.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They offer it to David - he accepts - 'it is fitting for me to bless - "Kos Yeshu'os Esa uv'Shem Hash-m Ekra." (Netzach Yisrael 33 - this is not a physical meal, rather, reward given corresponding to Yisrael's suffering in exile. The first five decline because a shortcoming in them caused some of this suffering (marrying two sisters led to the split of Malchus Yisrael); this does not apply to David, rather, Moshi'ach ben David will wipe out Esav!)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE LAST FOOD EATEN ON PESACH NIGHT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not have Afikoman after [eating the] Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is Afikoman? (Afik means to take out.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> [After finishing Pesach] one may not go to [eat anything in] another Chaburah [lest he eat Pesach in a second Chaburah - the Mishnah says, one may not clear his Kelim to another Chaburah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> It is [dessert, e.g.] for me mushrooms, or for Rav chicks. (The Mishnah says, we do not take out sweet things.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Shilo and R. Yochanan):</span> It is dates, parched grain and nuts (they hold like Shmuel, just they are used to different desserts).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Shmuel):</span> [Nowadays, we eat Matzah to commemorate the Pesach;] we may not have Afikoman after [this] Matzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> We may not have Afikoman after Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We may not have Afikoman after Pesach, but it is permitted after Matzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No - the Mishnah verse teaches a bigger Chidush:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Matzah's taste is not so strong, so we may not have dessert after it [for then the taste of Matzah would not remain in our mouths];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But Pesach's taste is strong, we would have thought that one may have dessert after it for its taste would remain in our mouths - the Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
