<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHO FORBIDS ZEH V'ZEH GOREM?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Eliezer attributes the result to the final Gorem, whether or not the Isur was not removed, unlike Abaye - he permits [Zeh v'Zeh Gorem, as long as the Isur did not fall in last, even] if they fell in at the same time!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> Wood from an Asheirah is Asur b'Hana'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was used to heat a new oven, it must be destroyed; if it was used to heat an old oven, it must cool down;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one baked in it [before it cooled down], the bread is forbidden; if the bread became mixed with other bread, it is forbidden to benefit from any of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, he takes the amount he benefited (Rashi - the cost of [Heter] wood of the amount of Asheirah wood he used; Tosfos (Avodah Zarah) - the value of the bread) and throws it in the sea, then he may benefit (Ra'avad on the Rif - but not eat; Ri (in Avodah Zarah) - or even eat) from all of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> One cannot redeem [something forbidden on account of] idolatry! (Really, these Chachamim also forbid Zeh v'Zeh Gorem - we do not know who they are, so we just say that R. Eliezer forbids it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps R. Eliezer forbids Zeh v'Zeh Gorem only regarding idolatry, which is stringent - he did not say so regarding other Isurim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If he does not say so regarding other Isurim, who is the Tana of Beraisa #1 above?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> R. Eliezer similarly forbids [Zeh v'Zeh Gorem] regarding all Isurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If the first Tana of Beraisa #1 forbids Zeh v'Zeh Gorem, Rebbi holds like R. Eliezer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he permits Zeh v'Zeh Gorem, Rebbi forbids the bread because Yesh Shevach Etzim b'Pas - bowls, cups and plates [made in a kiln heated with forbidden wood] are forbidden (there is Shevach Etzim inside, and they are used without a Gorem of Heter).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> They argue about ovens and pots - they are forbidden according to the opinion that forbids Zeh v'Zeh Gorem.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> All agree that a pot is forbidden, for it holds food before cooking [at the time it is the only Gorem].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHEVACH ETZIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef citing Shmuel):</span> If an oven was heated with peels of Orlah or straw of Kil'ai ha'Kerem:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is a new oven, it must be destroyed; if it is an old oven, one must let it cool down;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one baked in it [while it was still hot], Rebbi permits the bread, and Chachamim forbid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is the opposite of Beraisa #1 (Rebbi forbids, and Chachamim permit)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This was Shmuel's text of Beraisa #1 [unlike our text];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Shmuel holds that [normally] the Halachah follows Rebbi against one colleague, but not against many - here, the Halachah follows Rebbi against Chachamim - therefore, Shmuel intentionally switched the opinions in order that people [who assume that the Halachah follows Chachamim] will forbid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one cooked on top of coals, all permit the bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah or R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> This is only if the coals were dimming (we say that the Isur has changed form, they are permitted) - but if they were glowing (they are like the wood itself), they are forbidden [and Rebbi forbids the bread];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Yehudah and R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> Even if the coals were glowing, they are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the first opinion, we understand when Rebbi forbids the bread - but according to the second opinion, Rebbi permits even glowing coals - when does he forbid bread on account of Shevach Etzim b'Pas?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, the bread baked by the flame [while the wood was intact].</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that Chachamim permit even bread baked by a flame - if so, what Isur applies to wood?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami bar Chama):</span> It is forbidden to make a stool [or other Kelim] from them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If an oven was heated with Hekdesh wood and used to bake bread, what would Chachamim [who permit bread baked using Orlah and Kil'ai ha'Kerem] say?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> Chachamim forbid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> What is the difference between Hekdesh and Orlah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> <i>This</i> is not difficult - [one volume of] Orlah is Batel in 200 times its volume of Heter, but Hekdesh is not Batel even in 1000.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rava):</span> The one who lit the wood was Mo'el - this causes the wood to become Chulin [therefore the bread should be permitted]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, it is wood of a Shelamim, and according to R. Yehudah, who says that Hekdesh becomes Chulin only b'Shogeg, not b'Mezid:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It does not become Chulin b'Mezid because Me'ilah does not apply - likewise, Me'ilah does not apply to Shelamim (it is considered to be [primarily] destined to be consumed by the owner), so it does not become Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The wood does not become Chulin whenever the one who lit it was Mo'el!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Ashes of all Nisrafim (Isurei Hana'ah that must be burned) are permitted, except for those of an Asheirah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>[There is another exception,] ashes of Hekdesh are always forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> The case is, Hekdesh caught fire by itself. (Had someone burned it, he would transgress Me'ilah, the Hekdesh would become Chulin.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Shemayah):</span> The Beraisa refers to Terumas ha'Deshen, which requires Genizah (no Me'ilah was done to it):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Samo" - all the ashes must be placed down, gently, so they will not scatter.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MUST CHAMETZ BE BURNED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> The only way to fulfill Bi'ur is through burning;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A Kal va'Chomer mandates burning to fulfill Bi'ur;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Bal Yera'eh and Bal Yimatzei do not apply to Nosar, yet Nosar must be burned - they apply to Chametz, all the more so burning should be required!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> You cannot make a Kal va'Chomer if the stringency leads to a leniency!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If someone has no wood [to burn Chametz], you exempt him from destroying it - but it says "Tashbisu Se'or mi'Bateichem" - any way you can destroy it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> I can learn differently [from Mah Matzinu (precedent); Rashash - Rashi does not literally mean a Gezeirah Shavah]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is Asur to eat Chametz, just like Nosar - just like Nosar must be burned, also Chametz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Neveilah disproves this - one may not eat it, yet it need not be burned!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> These are different! It is Asur to eat or benefit from Chametz, just like Nosar - just like Nosar must be burned, also Chametz [but one may benefit from Neveilah]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Shor ha'Niskal disproves this - one may not eat or benefit from it, yet it need not be burned!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> These are different! Chametz is Asur b'Hana'ah and there is Kares for eating it, just like Nosar - just like Nosar must be burned, also Chametz [but there is no Kares for Shor ha'Niskal]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Chelev of Shor ha'Niskal disproves this - it is Asur b'Hana'ah and there is Kares for eating it, yet it need not be burned!</p></div>
