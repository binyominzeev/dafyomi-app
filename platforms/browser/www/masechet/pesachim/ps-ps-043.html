<p class="dedicationbox">12TH CYCLE DEDICATIONS:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>PESACHIM 43 (1 Adar) - dedicated in memory of Mordecai (Marcus) ben Elimelech Shmuel Kornfeld, who perished in the Holocaust along with most of his family. His Yahrzeit is observed on 1 Adar. May his death and the deaths of the other Kedoshim of the Holocaust atone for the sins of Klal Yisrael like Korbanos. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHICH COSMETICS CONTAIN CHAMETZ?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> Also women's cosmetics.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be! (Rashi - mascara, fragrances, etc. are not Chametz at all!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, it is salves [to remove pubic hair - see note in Appendix]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Benos Yisrael who bring hairs while they are still minors [and are embarrassed about this]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Poor girls apply plaster to remove them, rich girls use Soles, princesses use Mor oil - "Shishah Chodoshim b'Shemen ha'Mor."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Mor oil?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna bar Yirmeyah):</span> It is scented oil.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> It is oil of olives that did not reach a third of their [normal] growth.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Anfiknin is oil of olives that did not reach a third of their growth; one anoints with it to remove hair and soften skin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The general rule is - one transgresses on Pesach for anything from grain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua) Question:</span> Since one transgresses for anything from grain, why did Chachamim list these?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is so people will be familiar with them and what they are called;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A resident of Eretz Yisrael went to Bavel with meat; he requested an accompaniment for bread. He heard people saying 'Bring to him Kutach' [and knew from our Mishnah that it was dairy], and knew to refrain from it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CHAMETZ NUKSHEH AND MIXTURES OF CHAMETZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Lav forbids [eating them on Pesach].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is our Tana, who holds that both Nuksheh and mixtures of Chametz are forbidden by a Lav? (Nuksheh is grain that started fermenting, but never became proper Chametz that is good to eat. Aruch - it fermented by itself, without Se'or.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is R. Meir:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Sei'or (partially fermented dough - this is not Se'or, sourdough) must be burned; one may give it to his dog, and one who eats it receives 40 lashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> 'It must be burned' forbids benefit from it - 'one may give it to his dog' permits benefit from it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> (Sei'or is a dough that started whitening/has few cracks, according to R. Meir/R. Yehudah.) The Beraisa means, each Tana says that 'his' Sei'or must be burned;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yehudah says that R. Meir's Sei'or may be given to one's dog (mid'Oraisa, one may even eat it - it is proper Matzah);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The Seifa, 'One who eats it receives 40 lashes' is according to R. Meir [regarding his Sei'or].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>This shows that R. Meir forbids Nuksheh with a Lav - all the more so a Lav forbids a mixture of [proper] Chametz of grain!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> It is like R. Eliezer:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> One who eats proper Chametz of grain is Chayav Kares; one who eats a mixture of it transgresses a Lav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim agree about Chametz itself, but they say that one who eats a mixture does not transgress anything.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Eliezer forbids a mixture with a Lav - all the more he forbids pure Nuksheh with a Lav!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav Nachman answer like Rav Yehudah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Rav Nachman holds that we are more stringent about Nuksheh than a mixture of Chametz] - R. Meir forbids Nuksheh with a Lav, but perhaps he does not forbid a mixture with a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav Yehudah answer like Rav Nachman?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Rav Yehudah holds that we are more stringent about a mixture of Chametz than about Nuksheh] - R. Eliezer forbids a mixture with a Lav, but perhaps he does not forbid Nuksheh with a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yehudah - Beraisa):</span> "Kol Machmetzes Lo Sochelu" - this includes Kutach of Bavel, beer of Madai, vinegar of Edom, and Zeisum ha'Mitzri;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is Chayav Kares for these!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ki Kol Ochel Chametz v'Nichresah" - one is Chayav Kares for pure Chametz, but one [only] transgresses a Lav for mixtures.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We know that R. Eliezer forbids mixtures with a Lav - [surely, the Beraisa is like him, and] he does not forbid Nuksheh with a Lav!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SOURCE TO FORBID MIXTURES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Eliezer's source to forbid mixtures?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Kol Machmetzes Lo Sochelu" forbids them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should Mechayev Kares on account of Ki Kol Ochel Machmetzes v'Nichresah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That verse teaches about something else:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "Chametz" forbids something that became Chametz by itself (R. Chananel learns simply; Tosfos (28B) - 'by itself' means, through Se'or) - what is the source to forbid Chametz leavened through other things?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol Ochel Machmetzes v'Nichresah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, we should say that also "Kol Machmetzes Lo Sochelu" refers to something that fermented by itself, not to Nuksheh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "<i>Kol</i> Machmetzes Lo Sochelu" includes mixtures.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should also Mechayev Kares, on account of "Ki <i>Kol</i> Ochel Machmetzes v'Nichresah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That "Kol" is used to include women.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a different source to include women!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah (and Tana d'vei R. Yishmael)):</span> "Ish O Ishah Asher Ya'asu mi'Kol Chatos ha'Adam" - the Torah equates men and women regarding all punishments.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">43b----------------------------------------43b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Nevertheless, "Kol" is needed to include women;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "Lo Sochal Alav Chametz Shiv'as Yomim Tochal Alav Matzos" - whoever is commanded to eat Matzah is forbidden to eat Chametz;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One might have thought that women are exempt from eating Matzah, since it is a Mitzvas Ase sheha'Zeman Gerama (a positive Mitzvah that applies only at certain times), therefore they are also exempt from "Lo Sochal Alav Chametz" [even though they are normally commanded about all Lavin] - the verse teaches that this is not so;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The verse forbids them to eat Chametz - therefore, they are commanded to eat Matzah, like R. Elazar taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Mid'Oraisa, women are commanded to eat Matzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It says "Lo Sochal Alav Chametz Shiv'as Yomim Tochal Alav Matzos" - whoever is forbidden to eat Chametz is commanded to eat Matzah - since Chametz is forbidden to women, they are commanded to eat Matzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do you say that "Kol" includes women, not a mixture - perhaps it is just the contrary!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse ("Kol Ochel") refers to who eats - presumably, it includes eaters, not foods.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Noson, the father of Rav Huna):</span> Sometimes a verse discusses who eats and includes foods!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "Ki Kol Ochel Chelev Min ha'Behemah Asher Yakriv Mimenah Korban la'Shem" forbids Chelev of unblemished animals, which could be offered - what is the source to forbid Chelev of a Ba'al Mum?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Min ha'Behemah" forbids this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to forbid Chelev of Chulin animals?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ki Kol" forbids this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> "Ki Kol" discusses who eats, yet it includes foods!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, there are no other eaters that need to be included (there is no source to exclude women) - here, since we can use the verse to include eaters, this is preferable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim exempt for mixtures of Chametz, for they do not expound "Kol" [to include something if there is reason to exclude it] - what is their source to include women?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They do not expound "Kol," but they expound "Ki Kol."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Eliezer should expound "Kol" to include women, and "Ki Kol" to include [Kares for] mixtures!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he does not expound "Ki Kol."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa) Question:</span> "Se'or...Lo Saktiru" forbids Haktarah (burning Se'or or Chametz on the Mizbe'ach) of a whole k'Zayis - what is the source for half [a k'Zayis]?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Chol" forbids this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for [Haktarah of] a mixture?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ki Chol" forbids this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> We know that R. Eliezer expounds "Kol" - surely, the Beraisa is like him, and it also expounds "Ki Kol"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
