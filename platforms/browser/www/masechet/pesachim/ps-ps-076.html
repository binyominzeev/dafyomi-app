<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CONTACT BETWEEN HOT AND COLD FOODS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> If a hot food fell onto another hot food (one of them is Asur, or one is meat and the other is milk), all agree that both are forbidden (each absorbs from the other);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a cold food fell onto another cold food, all agree that both are permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one was cold and the other was hot, the top food overpowers (it causes the bottom food to be [hot or cold] like itself - this determines whether or not they will absorb from each other. In any case, a layer of the bottom food absorbs from the top and it must be removed);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The bottom food overpowers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If juice dripped onto the Cheres and splattered back, one must remove from that place.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> The Cheres was cold.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is like Rav - the hot juice overpowers and heats the Cheres - the Cheres then heats the juice, which then returns to the meat and cooks it from the heat of the Cheres;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We require "Tzeli Esh," it cannot be roasted by anything else!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But according to Shmuel, the Cheres should cool the drop!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yirmeyah answered elsewhere (the following question) by saying that the flour was hot - likewise, we can say that the Cheres was hot!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If juice dripped onto flour, one must remove a handful of flour [and burn it, for the juice is cooked by the flour and absorbed into it].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> The flour was cold.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is like Rav - the hot juice overpowers and heats the flour - the flour then heats the juice, the juice was cooked by something other than fire, it is not "Tzeli Esh";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But according to Shmuel, the flour should cool the drop [- it should suffice to remove a little where it fell, why is a handful required?! Rashi deletes this from the text - he assumes that the juice was fully roasted and hence permitted. R. Tam defends the text - we must say that it was only partially roasted, for otherwise further cooking could not forbid it!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The flour was hot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If the Korban was smeared with Terumah oil - if it is a Chaburah of Kohanim, they may eat it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they are Yisraelim - if the Korban is raw, we rinse it; if it was roasted, we peel off the outer layer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to Rav, we understand why it suffices to peel off the outer layer - the cold oil overpowers (Chavas Da'as Bi'urim 92:24 - the oil is considered to be 'on top', even if it is on bottom, because it is held in place by the Korban);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But according to Shmuel, the hot Korban should overpower, the oil should forbid the entire Korban (it gets absorbed)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Meat is smeared with a tiny amount of oil, therefore it does not spread throughout the entire Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Shmuel - Beraisa #1):</span> If a hot food fell onto another hot food, both are forbidden; the same applies if a cold food fell onto a hot food;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a hot or cold food fell onto a cold food, one rinses them off.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If a hot food fell onto a cold food, why does it suffice to rinse them - surely, before the cold cooled off the hot, there was some absorption, one should have to peel off a layer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if a hot food fell onto a cold food, one peels off a layer; if a cold food fell onto a cold food, he rinses them off.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If hot meat fell into hot milk, or if cold fell into hot, they are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If hot or cold fell into cold, one rinses them off.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If hot fell into cold, why does it suffice to rinse them - surely, before the cold cooled off the hot, there was some absorption, one should have to peel off a layer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if hot fell into cold, one peels off a layer; if cold fell into cold, he rinses them.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SALTED FOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If cold fell into cold, he rinses them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This is only if they were not salted - but if they were salted, they are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This is like Shmuel, who says that a salted food is like a hot food [regarding absorptions], and pickling [in vinegar] is like cooking (foods pickled together absorb from each other).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Shmuel says that a salted food is like a hot food only if it too salty to be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>A [salted] bird fell into a jar of Kutach; R. Chinena brei d'Rava of Pashrunya permitted them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> He holds that Shmuel considers salted food like hot food only if it too salty to be eaten - the bird was not so salty.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This is only if it (the bird) was raw - if it was roasted, we peel off the outer layer;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>This is only if it does not have cracks and was not seasoned - if it had cracks or was seasoned, it is forbidden.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FOODS ROASTED TOGETHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If fat slaughtered meat was roasted with lean Neveilah meat, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The fat transfers from one to the other and back.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Levi):</span> Even if lean slaughtered meat was roasted with fat Neveilah meat, it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It absorbs a mere smell - smell is insignificant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>A case occurred, a kid was roasted with a pig in the Reish Galusa's house - Levi permitted it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> We may not roast two Pesachim together on account of mixing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that the tastes mix [and one will taste from a Pesach on which he is not Manuy] - this refutes Levi!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is forbidden lest the two animals get mixed up.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> This is forbidden <i>even</i> if one is a goat and the other is a lamb.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We understand this if the concern is lest they get mixed up (Rashi - <i>even</i> these could get mixed; R. Chananel - we decree on account of similar animals);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But if the concern is transfer of taste, a goat and a lamb are just like two goats! (Seemingly, it is a bigger Chidush to forbid Min b'Eino Mino, which depends on Nosen Ta'am, whereas since some forbid Min b'Mino b'Mashehu! Tzelach - we do not Mevatel Isurim l'Chatchilah, therefore it is not a bigger Chidush.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the only the concern is lest they get mixed up, but we are not concerned for transfer of taste, this refutes Rav!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The case is, the Pesachim were cooked in two pots.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be (Pesach must be roasted over a fire)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is as if they were cooked in two pots (a mound of coals or ashes separates the two spits) - the Beraisa says, we may not roast two Pesachim together on account of mixing;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This refers to mixing of tastes - and even if it is as if they are in two pots [and the tastes will not mix], it is forbidden lest they get mixed up, even a goat and a lamb.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Mari):</span> Tana'im argue about this:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If hot bread from an oven was placed on top of a barrel of Terumah wine, it is forbidden to a Zar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah permits;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yosi permits [if the bread was of] wheat, but forbids barley, for barley absorbs [the smell of the wine].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Meir says that smell is important, and R. Yehudah says that it is not!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Partial affirmation:</span> Indeed, Levi must say that Tana'im argue about this (clearly, R. Meir and R. Yosi are concerned for smell - Levi hold like R. Yehudah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav must agree that Tana'im argue about this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No - he can say that all agree that smell is significant, like Rabah bar bar Chanah explained:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> All [the Tana'im] agree that if warm bread was put on top of an open barrel, it is forbidden (it absorbs a strong smell);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>All permit cold bread that was put on top of a closed barrel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They argue about warm bread on a closed barrel and cold bread on an open barrel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>This (slaughtered meat roasted with Neveilah, which Rav forbids) is also like warm bread on an open barrel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana brei d'Rav Chinena - Beraisa):</span> If bread was baked in an oven with roasting meat, it may not be eaten with Kutach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>A case occurred, fish was roasted with meat - Rava of Parzakiya forbade eating it with Kutach;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p>Mar bar Rav Ashi forbade eating it even with salt (i.e. alone), for it (a mixture of fish and meat) is prone to cause odor and Tzara'as.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>KORBANOS BROUGHT B'TUM'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Five Korbanos [that are normally eaten] are brought b'Tum'ah but may not be eaten b'Tum'ah - the Omer, Shtei ha'Lechem, Lechem ha'Panim, Zivchei Shalmei Tzibur (two lambs brought with Shtei ha'Lechem), and goats [Chata'os] brought on Rosh Chodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Pesach that is brought b'Tum'ah is eaten b'Tum'ah, for the sole reason it is brought is in order to be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> It says five - what does this come to exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes Chagigah of the 15th;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since it is a Korban Tzibur with a fixed time, it is brought b'Tum'ah - the Mishnah teaches that this is not so - since it can be brought throughout the festival, it is not Docheh Shabbos, and therefore is not Docheh Tum'ah either.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't it count goats [Chata'os] brought on festivals?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It counts Zivchei Shalmei Tzibur (we understand that other animals also are offered b'Tum'ah but not eaten).</p></div>
