<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHY IS THERE A LAV?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> The Beraisa is R. Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "...Sharu'a v'Kalut Nedavah Ta'aseh Oso" - you may Makdish a blemished animal to Bedek ha'Bayis, but not a Tam; one who is Makdish a Tam to Bedek ha'Bayis transgresses an Ase.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that he transgresses a Lav?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah):</span> "Va'Ydaber Hash-m El Moshe Leimor" - this teaches that a Lav applies to the entire Parashah. (Likewise, the Parashah of Pesach begins "Va'Yomer Hash-m...Leimor.")</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rebbi):</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Bar Kapara):</span> "Leimor" - we read this 'Lo Ne'emar' (a Lav was said) regarding thee matters. (Tosfos - [only] when there is a Lav derived from an Ase, we expound this to consider it a Lav.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Bei Rav):</span> We read this 'Lav Emor' (tell Yisrael that there is a Lav).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SAFEGUARDS AGAINST CHIMUTZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The water that a baker uses [must be spilled out, for it becomes Chametz].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One spills it on an incline, not in a place [with crevices] where it will collect [and become Chametz].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> One may spill it on in a place where it will collect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> When there is much water, it will not be absorbed quickly [so it must be spilled on an incline]; when there is little water, it will be absorbed quickly [so it need not be spilled on an incline].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A woman should knead only with water she'Lanu (was overnight out of the ground, for it is cooler and does not hasten Chimutz; water in the ground is cold during the day and warm at night - 94B).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rav Masnah expounded this [in Hebrew] in Papanoi; the next day, everyone brought Kelim and asked for some of his water (they understood 'Shelanu', <i>our</i> water); he explained his intent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A woman should not knead in the sun, or with water heated by the sun or removed from a kettle;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>She should work with the dough constantly (this impedes Chimutz) until it is baked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>She must have two Kelim [of water], one to smear on the dough, and the other to cool her hands (so her hands will not hasten Chimutz; the smearing water gets warm, so it may not be used to cool her hands).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one transgressed and kneaded [with warm water], what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mar Zutra):</span> The bread is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> It is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Mar Zutra, for himself - Beraisa):</span> One may not Loses barley during Pesach; if one did, it is forbidden only if the kernels split. (Likewise, if we do not see signs of Chimutz in a dough kneaded with warm water, it is permitted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> Not everything follows the same rules! There, it was taught that b'Di'eved, it is permitted - here, it was not taught! (Rashi - one may eat Nochri dough if it does not have signs of Chimutz, even though warm water might have been used - but we cannot learn from there to where a Yisrael transgressed.)</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MIXTURES OF CHAMETZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one owns any of the following during Pesach, he transgresses [Bal Yera'eh and Bal Yimatzei - Rashi; Tosfos - the following may not be eaten on Pesach]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kutach of Bavel (a dip made with stale bread and whey), beer of Madai, vinegar of Edom, Zeisum ha'Mitzri, Zuman of dyers, Ameilan of butchers, and Kolan of Sofrim (the Gemara will explain them);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer adds women's cosmetics.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The general rule is - during Pesach, one transgresses for (Tosfos - may not eat) anything from grain; there is a Lav for it but not Kares (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Three things were taught about Kutach of Bavel - it blunts the heart, blinds the eyes, and weakens the body;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The whey in it blunts the heart, the salt blinds the eyes, and the mold of the bread weakens the body.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three things increase excrement, bend a person's stature (weaken him) and remove one part in 500 of his eyesight - coarse bread, new beer and raw vegetables [if he regularly eats much of them].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three things decrease excrement, straighten stature and enlighten the  eyes - clean bread, fatty meat and old wine;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This refers to clean bread made from Soles, fatty meat is of a goat (Aruch - or bird) that did not give birth, and very old wine (three years old).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Everything that helps [a sickness afflicting] one part of the body aggravates another part and vice-versa, except for wet ginger, long peppercorns, clean bread, fatty meat and old wine - these are good for the whole body.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beer of Madai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>They put barley in it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Vinegar of Edom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>They put barley in it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Earlier (when the Mikdash stood), Nesachim were brought from Yehudah - in this merit wine from Yehudah would not sour unless barley was added - such vinegar was called [plain] vinegar [since there was no vinegar from pure wine];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Nowadays, the wine of Edom does not sour unless barley is added - it is called vinegar of Edom;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This fulfills "Imal'ah ha'Charavah" - if Yisrael is full (thriving), Edom is destroyed, and vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman Bar Yitzchak):</span> We learn this from "U'Le'om me'Le'om Ye'ematz."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> At first, one who bought vinegar from an Am ha'Aretz in Yehudah did not need to tithe it, for [since proper wine did not sour] it was Muchzak to come from Temed (water poured over grape pits - it ferments a bit. Rashash - above we said that [most] vinegar was made by putting barley in wine! Perhaps actually a <i>minority</i> came from Temed - since most Amei ha'Aretz tithe, and perhaps it is from Temed, we do not require tithing.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Nowadays, one who buys vinegar from an Am ha'Aretz must tithe it, for it is Muchzak to come from wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah does not exempt Temed from Ma'aser!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one put water on dregs, and the same volume exuded, it is exempt from tithes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah obligates.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> [He obligates tithing Temed that is Tevel - in the Beraisa,] he exempts only because Amei ha'Aretz are not suspected about it (it is unimportant, so they are not stingy about it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Amei ha'Aretz are suspected about it - in the Beraisa he exempts Temed made from pits (it is not real fruit, it absorbs a mere acidity); in the Mishnah he obligates Temed made from dregs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Zeisum ha'Mitzri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> It is a third barley, a third saffron, and a third salt;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Barley is not used, rather, wheat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A way to remember the opinions - Sisni (or Samech-Samech - Rav Yosef, who has a Samech in his name, said barley, which begins with Sin, which is interchangeable with Samech).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p>These are soaked together, roasted, ground up, and [mixed into water;] one drinks it between Pesach and Shavu'os - it loosens one who is constipated, and constipates one who has diarrhea;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is dangerous for a sick person or a pregnant woman to drink it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>CHAMETZ USED FOR CERTAIN PROFESSIONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Zomen of dyers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Bavel):</span> This is water in which bran was soaked - it is used in dye.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ameilan of butchers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This is bread made from grain that did not grow a third [of its ultimate size], it is put on the brim of pots to absorb froth.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Chachamim of Bavel):</span> This is glue [made from water and rye flour; it is used to stick leather straps together];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Rav Simi of Chuzna'ah):</span> Rich girls make a salve with fine flour [to remove hair] - they give leftovers to daughters of Sofrim (teachers of children, who are generally poor).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Simi - R. Chiya's Beraisa):</span> The Mishnah discusses four things called by the name of countries, and three things particular to certain professions (a salve is not particular to any profession)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> If it is glue [used for leather straps], why does it say 'of Sofrim' - it should say 'of strap makers'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Oshaya):</span> Really, it is glue - Sofrim (scribes) used it to stick parchments together.</p></div>
