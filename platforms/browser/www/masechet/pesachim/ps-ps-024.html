<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> This verse teaches R. Shimon's law!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> "Ba'Kodesh...ba'Esh Tisaref" - this teaches that a [Pasul] Chatas is burned in the Kodesh (the Azarah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for other Kodshei Kodoshim and Eimurim of Kodshim Kalim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Chol...ba'Kodesh...ba'Esh Tisaref." (Answer #1 is rejected.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 3:e, 23B - the Talmid):</span> Your Rebbi, R. Yonason, learns [other Isurim] from "V'Im Yivaser mi'Besar ha'Milu'im...[<i>Lo Ye'achel</i>]";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this? Obviously one may not eat it - it says "V'Sorafta Es ha'Nosar ba'Esh"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we use it to teach about other things forbidden [to eat] - since we do not need this to learn Isur Achilah, we learn Isur Hana'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like Nosar is burned, we should say that all Isurim must be burned!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Sorafta Es ha'Nosar ba'Esh" - Nosar is burned, other Isurim are not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We use "Lo Ye'achel" [in the verse of Milu'im] to teach R. Elazar's law!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Lo Ye'achel Ki Kodesh Hu" - this is a Lav forbidding eating any Pasul Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Really, we learn Isurei Hana'ah from "V'Chol Chatas..." - but not like we said before (we do not learn from "Ba'Esh Tisaref," rather, from "Lo Se'achel"):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It would have sufficed to say "Ba'Esh Tisaref" - what do we learn from "Lo Se'achel"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It need not teach about the Chatas itself - we learn [the Isur to eat it from "Ba'Esh Tisaref," and a Lav] from R. Elazar's teaching - we use it to teach about other Isurim [of Achilah] - since we need not learn Isur Achilah, we learn Isur Hana'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like a Pasul Chatas is burned, we should say that all Isurim must be burned!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Sorafta Es ha'Nosar ba'Esh" - Nosar is burned, other Isurim are not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps "Lo Se'achel" comes to forbid a Pasul Chatas with its own Lav - it is not enough to rely on R. Elazar's Lav, for that is Lav shebi'Chlalos (different Isurim forbidden by one Lav), one is not lashed for it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> Rather, we learn from "Veha'Basar Asher Yiga b'Chol Tamei <i>Lo Ye'achel</i> ba'Esh Yisaref:"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not need this for [a Lav] for it itself, a Kal va'Chomer from Ma'aser teaches this:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Ma'aser is more lenient [than Kodshim], yet it says "V'Lo Vi'arti Mimenu b'Tamei" (it is forbidden if the eater or the Ma'aser is Tamei) - all the more so, a Lav forbids Tamei Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Kal va'Chomer cannot teach an Azharah (a Lav to Mechayev lashes)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Hekesh (a verse equates them) - "Lo Suchal Le'chol bi'Sh'arecha Masar Degancha...u'Vchoros Bekarcha...";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since "Lo Ye'achel" is not needed for it itself, we use it to teach about other Isurim [of Achilah] - since we need not learn Isur Achilah, we learn Isur Hana'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like Tamei Kodshim is burned, we should say that all Isurim must be burned!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Sorafta Es ha'Nosar ba'Esh" - Nosar is burned, other Isurim are not.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>LAVIM FOR TAMEI KODSHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Perhaps the verse teaches about Tamei Kodshim itself, to Mechayev a second Lav, similar to Abaye's teaching!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If one ate a Putisa (a bug found in water), he receives four [sets of 39] lashes (there are two Lavim for Sheretz ha'Mayim, and two [general] Lavim for [all kinds of] Sheratzim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he ate an ant, he is lashed five times (the two general Lavim, and three for Sheretz ha'Aretz);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he ate a wasp, he is lashed six times [for the above five and for Sheretz ha'Of].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Whenever we can expound to learn a new law we do so, rather than to say that the Torah forbids the same matter with multiple Lavim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "<i>Ve</i>ha'Basar Asher Yiga b'Chol Tamei Lo Ye'achel"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This includes wood and frankincense [of Hekdesh, one is liable for eating them b'Tum'ah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from the end of this verse, "<i>Ve</i>ha'Basar Kol Tahor Yochal Basar"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This includes the Eimurim [the parts offered on the Mizbe'ach].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A different verse includes them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Veha'Nefesh Asher Tochal Besar mi'Zevach ha'Shelamim <i>Asher la'Shem</i>" - this includes the Eimurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is Mechayev Kares for a Tamei person who ate Eimurim - our verse is a Lav for eating Tamei Eimurim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>LIABILITY FOR ABNORMAL BENEFIT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Avahu citing R. Yochanan):</span> One is not lashed for eating any Isur in an abnormal way.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he come to exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Simi Bar Ashi):</span> He exempts one who eats raw Chelev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Avahu citing R. Yochanan):</span> One is not lashed for benefit from any Isur in an abnormal way.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he come to exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Simi Bar Ashi):</span> He exempts one who put Chelev of Shor ha'Niskal on a wound; all the more so, one who eats raw Chelev is exempt. (Its normal benefit is to burn it or smear it on hide.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (R. Avya citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one put Chelev of Shor ha'Niskal on a wound he is exempt, for one is not lashed for benefit from any Isur in an abnormal way.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (R. Zeira - Mishnah):</span> The only liquids of Orlah for which one is lashed [for drinking them] are wine and olive oil.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One is not lashed for juice of strawberries, dates and pomegranates.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is because this is not the normal way to consume them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> If it would exempt consuming the fruits themselves abnormally, this would be a support;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But the Mishnah only exempts for [the juice, which is] a mere secretion!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> All agree that one is lashed for benefit from Kil'ai ha'Kerem even in an abnormal way.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Isur for Kil'ai ha'Kerem is not expressed regarding eating [rather, "Pen Tikdash" - this is expounded Pen Tukad Esh, lest it will [have to] be burned].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Isi ben Yehudah) Question:</span> What is the source forbidding Basar v'Chalav (meat cooked with milk)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Ki Am Kadosh Ata la'Shem Elokecha [...Lo Sevashel Gedi ba'Chalev Imo]" and "V'Anshei Kodesh Tihyun Li" - just like the latter verse discusses [Tereifah, an] Isur, also the former.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This forbids eating - what is the source to forbid benefit?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Kal va'Chomer - Orlah did not result from transgression, yet it is Asur b'Hana'ah - Basar v'Chalav results from a transgression, all the more so it is Asur b'Hana'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Orlah, for it never was permitted - meat and milk were permitted [before they were cooked together]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chametz b'Pesach shows that Isur Hana'ah does not depend on this - it is Asur b'Hana'ah, even though it was once permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Chametz, which is punishable by Kares, to Basar v'Chalav, which has no Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kil'ai ha'Kerem shows that Isur Hana'ah does not depend on this - it is Asur b'Hana'ah, even though it has no Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> According to Abaye, we cannot learn from Kil'ai ha'Kerem, for one is lashed for benefit from it even in an abnormal way!</p></div>
