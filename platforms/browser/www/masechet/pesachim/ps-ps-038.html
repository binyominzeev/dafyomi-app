<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THINGS THAT DEPEND ON OWNERSHIP</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> R. Meir [who considers Ma'aser Sheni to be like Hekdesh] would exempt a dough of Ma'aser from Chalah; Chachamim [who consider it to be a person's money] would obligate it (all of these laws will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Meir would say that one is not Yotzei with Matzah of Ma'aser; Chachamim would say that one is Yotzei with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Meir would say that one is not Yotzei [taking the four species on Sukos] on Yom Tov if the Esrog is of Ma'aser; Chachamim would say that one is Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> I understand regarding Chalah - it says "Arisoseichem," it is obligated only if it belongs to you;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>I understand regarding Esrog - it says "Lachem," it must belong to you;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But it does not say 'Matzaschem' - why must it belong to you?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava or Rav Yemar):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Lechem-Lechem" - it says here "Lechem Oni," and it says regarding Chalah "V'Hayah ba'Achalchem mi'Lechem ha'Aretz" - just like there it must be yours, also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Beraisa supports Rav Asi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A dough of Ma'aser Sheni is exempt from Chalah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim obligate it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this only a suggestion - this is exactly like Rav Asi said!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We suggest that just like they argue about Chalah [like Rav Asi says that they do], they also argue about Matzah and Esrog;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Or, perhaps this is only regarding Chalah, for it says "Arisoseichem" twice [but elsewhere, even R. Meir does not exclude Ma'aser]!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MATZAH OF CHALAH OF MA'ASER SHENI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> May one be Yotzei with Matzah of Chalah of Ma'aser Sheni [according to Chachamim] in Yerushalayim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We do not ask according to R. Yosi ha'Gelili - he holds that one is not Yotzei even with the 'Chulin' (i.e. the rest of the Ma'aser after taking Chalah), surely he is not Yotzei with the Chalah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> We ask according to R. Akiva, who holds that one is Yotzei with the Chulin, for if it would become Tamei, one could redeem it and eat it anywhere:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He is not Yotzei with the Chalah, for this Heter does not apply to Tamei Chalah - it must be burned!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, perhaps <i>since</i> had he not (R. Chananel - before he) made it Chalah, it could have become Tamei and permitted everywhere [through redemption], one would be Yotzei with it, even now that he made it Chalah, he is Yotzei with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> We do not ask about this - surely, we say 'since' - rather, we ask about Chalah bought with Ma'aser money;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>We do not ask according to Chachamim [who permit redeeming something bought with Ma'aser money if it became Tamei] - since it has a [potential] Heter everywhere, one is Yotzei with it just like with Chalah of Ma'aser itself;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We ask according to R. Yehudah, who says that it must be buried.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If something bought with Ma'aser money became Tamei, we redeem it;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it must be buried.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Do we say, <i>since</i> had this not been bought with Ma'aser money (rather, it itself was Ma'aser - see note in Appendix), and <i>since</i> had he not made it Chalah, it could have been permitted anywhere if it became Tamei and was redeemed, also now he is Yotzei with it;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Or, perhaps we apply <i>since</i> only once! (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Presumably, all Ma'aser is the same (just like one is Yotzei with Ma'aser Chulin, one is Yotzei with Chalah of Ma'aser [or Chalah bought with Ma'aser money], since Chalah itself can be used for Matzah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>IS ONE YOTZEI WITH LACHMEI TODAH OR REKIKEI NAZIR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one made Lachmei Todah or Rekikei Nazir [for himself, he is not Yotzei with them; if he made them to sell them, he is Yotzei].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> "U'Shmartem Es ha'Matzos" - Matzah must be guarded for the Mitzvah of eating it - these are guarded not for Matzas Mitzvah, rather, for the Korban.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">38b----------------------------------------38b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> "Shiv'as Yomim Matzos Tochelu" - this refers to Matzah that may be eaten for seven days - Lachmei Todah and Rekikei Nazir may be eaten only for one day and a night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rabah - Beraisa #1) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is Yotzei with Lachmei Todah or Rekikei Nazir!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "U'Shmartem Es ha'Matzos" - Matzah must be guarded for the Mitzvah of eating it - these are guarded not for Matzah, rather, for the Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Support (for Rav Yosef - Beraisa #2) Suggestion: Perhaps one is Yotzei with Lachmei Todah or Rekikei Nazir!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Shiv'as Yomim Matzos Tochelu" - this refers to Matzah that may be eaten for seven days - these may be eaten only for one day and a night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against both opinions):</span> We should exclude them from "Lechem Oni" - these may not be eaten b'Aninus, rather, in joy!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like R. Akiva, who expounds according to how it is written, i.e. "Ani" (of poverty, excluding a dough kneaded with wine, oil or honey).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should be invalid because it is Matzah Ashirah (it is kneaded with oil)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> Less than a Revi'is of oil is used for many [large] loaves (this is not considered Ashirah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should be invalid because it cannot be eaten anywhere [rather, only inside Yerushalayim]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> This teaches that Lachmei Todah and Rekikei Nazir could be eaten [in any walled city in Eretz Yisrael if they were offered when the Mishkan was] in Nov and Giv'on (see note in Appendix).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Ilai) Question:</span> May one be Yotzei with Lachmei Todah or Rekikei Nazir?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> I did not hear about this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> It was taught that if one made them for himself, he is not Yotzei with them; if he made them to sell them, he is Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - R. Eliezer (when he heard this):</span> Indeed, this is what Hash-m told Moshe on Sinai!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Eliezer:</span> Can he say a Halachah [without a reason, as if it was] a tradition from Sinai?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> One who makes Matzos intending to sell them has in mind that if he cannot sell them he will use them himself [therefore, he also guarded them l'Shem Mitzvas Matzah].</p></div>
