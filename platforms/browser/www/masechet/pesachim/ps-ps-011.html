<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>REAPING BEFORE THE OMER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere, R. Yehudah does not make such a decree!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Immediately after the Omer was offered, the markets of Yerushalayim were full of flour and parched grain of Chodosh (grain that took root after last Pesach; it is forbidden until the Omer is brought the next Pesach) - Chachamim disapproved (lest people come to eat grain while processing it before the Omer);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R.Yehudah says, Chachamim approved.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah does not decree lest one will eat it if he deals with it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Harvesting before the Omer must be done by hand [without a scythe] - this reminds him not to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Granted, this reminds him not to eat while harvesting, but perhaps he will eat while grinding or sifting!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He must grind [unlike the usual manner] with a hand-mill [not with a water-mill], he turns the sifter upside down when sifting.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It is permitted to harvest Beis ha'Shelachin (a field that must be irrigated) normally - perhaps he will eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may harvest Beis ha'Shelachin in a valley, but one may not make piles of the grain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> People shun Chodosh (it is forbidden from its inception), they do not shun Chametz [which is permitted all year].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Indeed, you answer the contradiction in R. Yehudah - but Chachamim also contradict themselves (they are concerned about Chodosh, but not about Chametz!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> You already answered for R. Yehudah; Chachamim do not decree about Chametz - since he searches in order to burn it, we are not concerned lest he eat [what he finds]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (for R. Yehudah - Rav Ashi):</span> R. Yehudah permits flour and parched grain (they are not normally eaten).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is wrong! Granted, we are not concerned lest one eat parched grain - however, perhaps he will eat before it is parched!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we are not concerned because he must harvest by hand, like Rava answered!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is permitted to harvest Beis ha'Shelachin normally - perhaps he will eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Rav Ashi is refuted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN DOES R. YEHUDAH DECREE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> You cannot say that R. Yehudah [always] decrees when people do not [normally] refrain from something!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not puncture an eggshell and fill it with oil and put it on top of a lamp in order that the oil will drip into the lamp [on Shabbos, lest one take oil for consumption and transgress extinguishing];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is forbidden to leave oil dripping even from a Kli Cheres [which is repulsive, and makes the oil less appealing];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah permits [both of these. Chachamim's opinion is not difficult - regarding Chametz they permit only because he seeks to burn it.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, people refrain because Shabbos is so severe.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Elsewhere, R. Yehudah is stringent regarding Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the rope of a bucket broke, one may not tie it, he may make a bow;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah permits to tie a belt, but not to make a bow (he decrees on account of a knot)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah and Chachamim both contradict themselves!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1 (for Chachamim):</span> Chachamim forbid a weaver's rope on account of a regular rope, for these can be confused - they do not forbid a bow on account of a knot, people do not confuse them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 2 (for R. Yehudah):</span> R. Yehudah does not forbid a bow on account of a knot - rather, he holds that a bow is considered a knot!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim contradict themselves!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may tie a belt on a bucket [to hang it over a pit, for one will not leave it there permanently], one may not tie it with a rope;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of rope is it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is a regular rope.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yehudah would not permit this - surely he will leave it there permanently, it a permanent knot!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a weaver's rope; Chachamim decree to forbid a weaver's rope on account of a regular rope.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People confuse different kinds of ropes, but they do not confuse a knot and a bow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Sometimes R. Yehudah decrees even when people refrain!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If a Bechor is sick on account of excess blood, one may not let blood [even in a place that will not make a blemish], even if it will die [even though everyone evades Hekdesh, for fear of transgressing Me'ilah];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim permit as long as he does not make a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, since a person is frantic lest he suffer a monetary loss, if we permit him in a place that will not make a Mum, he might do so in a place that will make a Mum;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Chachamim disagree - if you forbid everywhere, all the more so he will be frantic and might let blood in a place that will make a Mum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah does not decree because a person is frantic about his money!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> One may not Mekared (comb dirt off an animal), lest it make a wound, but one may Mekartzef (this will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim forbid to Mekared, and even to Mekartzef [lest he Mekared].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Kirud is combing with a thin bristled comb, it wounds; Kartzuf is with a thick bristled comb, it does not wound.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one will not let blood from a sick animal, it may die, therefore a person is frantic - if one refrains from combing, the animal will merely have pain, a person is not frantic about this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Yehudah decree regarding Chametz [lest he eat what he finds], but not regarding Kartzuf?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One can confuse different kinds of bread (Matzah and Chametz) - one would not confuse Kirud with Kartzuf. (Chachamim say that these could be confused.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE LAST TIME ONE MAY EAT CHAMETZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> One may eat Chametz [on Erev Pesach] until the end of five hours of the day; we burn it at the beginning of the sixth hour;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, one may eat until the end of four hours; we Toleh during the fifth hour, and we burn at the beginning of the sixth hour.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah said further, that two [Chametz] loaves of a Pasul Todah (40 loaves accompany Korban Todah; 10 of them are Chametz) are left on a bench in Har ha'Bayis - as long as both are there, it is permitted to eat;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>When one is removed, we Toleh - we may not eat, but we need not burn;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>When the second is removed, everyone starts to burn.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Gamliel says, Chulin may be eaten until the end of the fourth hour; and Terumah may be eaten until the end of the fifth hour; we burn at the beginning of the sixth hour.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>HOW MUCH DO PEOPLE ERR ABOUT TIME?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven and David testify about the same event [in a capital case], and Reuven says that it happened on the second of the month and David says that it was the third, their testimony stands - we assume that Reuven heard that the previous month had 30 days, and David did not hear (he thought it had only 29 days - people often err about this);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Reuven says that it was the third and David says that it was the fifth, their testimony is disqualified.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If Reuven says that it was in the second hour of the day and David says that it was the third, their testimony stands;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Reuven says that it was the third and David says that it was the fifth, their testimony is disqualified.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If Reuven says that it was the fifth hour and David says that it was the seventh, [all agree that] their testimony is disqualified, because [people do not err about this -] in the fifth hour the sun is in the east, and in the seventh it is in the west.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Abaye):</span> According to R. Meir, people do not err at all [about the time of day - when Reuven says two and Shimon says three, we assume that] Reuven means the end of the second hour, and David means the start of the third (these are the same);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to R. Yehudah, people err by half an hour - [when they say three and five,] it really happened in the middle of the fourth hour; Reuven means the end of the third hour - he errs by a half hour in front [he thought that it was earlier];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>David means the start of the fifth hour - he errs by a half hour in back.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Abaye):</span> According to R. Meir, people err by Mashehu (a tiny amount) - it really happened at the end of the second hour or the start of the third, one of the witnesses errs Mashehu;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to R. Yehudah, people err by an hour and Mashehu - it really happened at the end of the third hour or the start of the fifth - one of them errs by an hour and Mashehu (we do not attribute error to both witnesses). (end of Version #2)</p></div>
