<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CAN PESACH SHENI BE BROUGHT MI'SAFEK? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We cannot do so, on account of Chazah v'Shok (if it is Shelamim, the chest and foreleg must be given to a Kohen to eat).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Each Chaburah could bring a Kohen [to take and eat Chazah v'Shok]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It cannot - if the Kohen already fulfilled Pesach [he cannot be Manuy now], perhaps he eats Pesach without Minuy!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he was not Yotzei Pesach, he cannot be Nimneh with this Chaburah - perhaps it brings Shelamim, and he will not be Yotzei Pesach now!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> One Kohen [who was not Yotzei Pesach] can be Nimneh with all five Chaburos - he eats Chazah v'Shok of each and he is Yotzei, for one of them is a Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, we cannot stipulate, for this reduces the time to eat Shelamim (it should be permitted for two days and a night - because it is Safek Pesach it may be eaten only for one night, and this might cause it to become Nosar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They could Makdish a Pesach, and stipulate that (Rashi; Tosfos - automatically,) if they were already Yotzei, it is Mosar Pesach - Mosar Pesach is eaten only one day and a night. (Sefas Emes - still, this is Mema'et the time - Pesach is eaten only at night! Or Chadash - aso Mosar Pesach is eaten only at night.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An animal cannot become Mosar Pesach unless it was initially Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> They should strive to find a Mosar Pesach (e.g. a Pesach that was left over, or excess money Hukdash for Pesach, i.e. if a cheaper Korban was bought)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, we cannot do so, because Mosar Pesach requires Semichah (one presses on the neck of his Korban), and Pesach does not. (The Tana requires Semichah with all one's strength - he supports himself on [and benefits from] Kodshim, it is permitted only if it is a Mitzvah, so it may not be done mi'Safek.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This applies to [Chaburos of] men, but not to women - they never do Semichah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Rather, we cannot do so, because Dam Pesach is put only once on the Mizbe'ach, but Mosar Pesach requires [two Zerikos on opposite corners, the blood goes] on all four sides.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> One Zerikah suffices [b'Di'eved]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one Zerikah was done for any Korban [whose blood should be put on the outer Mizbe'ach], it was Mechaper (the Korban is valid).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5:</span> Rather, we cannot do so, because Dam Pesach must be poured onto the [Yesod of the] Mizbe'ach, but Mosar Pesach requires Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One is Yotzei even if it was poured!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> [Even] if the Torah says that the blood of a Korban should be thrown, if it was poured on the Mizbe'ach, it was Mechaper.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only b'Di'eved, it is not l'Chatchilah. (This also defends Answer #4.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN MAY ONE BE NIMNEH OR WITHDRAW</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man told his children 'I will slaughter the Pesach on behalf of whichever of you comes first to Yerushalayim', once the head and majority of the first child enter, he acquires his portion, and his siblings acquire with him (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> This shows that Yesh Breirah (retroactively, he was Manuy)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan said, the father was only training them to be zealous in Mitzvos (really, the father was Memaneh all his children at the time of slaughter).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support #1:</span> The Mishnah says, once the first child enters, he acquires his portion, and his siblings acquire through him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We understand this if they were Menuyim at the time of slaughter;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But if not, they could not acquire shares later!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may be Manuy or withdraw until slaughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support #2 (Beraisa):</span> A case occurred, the daughters came to Yerushalayim before the sons - the daughters were zealous, the sons were lowly. (This shows that the whole intent was to make them zealous.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> People may be Nimnim on a Pesach as long as there is a k'Zayis for each one;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>People may be Nimnim or withdraw until slaughter;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Shimon says, until Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the Chidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches that even though one Chaburah was already Nimneh, [it may totally withdraw and] another Chaburah may be Nimneh [unlike R. Yehudah (99A)].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> People may be Nimnim or withdraw until slaughter; [R. Shimon says, until Zerikah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> They argue about withdrawing:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana expounds "Mi'<i>Hyos</i> mi'Seh" - while it has Chiyus (life - 'Hei' and 'Ches' are interchangeable);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon expounds "Mi'Hyos mi'Seh" - while it has Havayah (as long as we are engaged in offering it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But no one allows Minuy after slaughter - "B'Michsas Nefashos...<i>Tachoso</i>" (you will slaughter).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> People may be Nimnim or withdraw until slaughter;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>R. Shimon permits Minuy until slaughter, and withdrawing until Zerikah.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CAN A CHABURAH TELL A MEMBER TO EAT BY HIMSELF?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Memaneh Shimon on his share of a Pesach, Reuven's Chaburah may give him his share and tell them to eat elsewhere. (This Tana allows Pesach to be eaten in two Chaburos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara) Question:</span> If a member of a Chaburah eats faster [and more] than others, can the Chaburah tell him to take his share and eat elsewhere?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Can he tell them 'You accepted me'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, can they say 'We accepted you to help with the Korban [so there will not be Nosar], but not to eat more than us'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Memaneh Shimon on his share of a Pesach, his Chaburah may give him his share and tell them to eat elsewhere.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is because he and Shimon are like one member of a Chaburah who eats quickly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a fast eater can say 'You accepted me', the same should apply here!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No - the Chaburah can refuse to eat together because there are extra people;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even if the two combined eat like one, the Chaburah can say that they do not want an outsider.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If a waiter ate a k'Zayis by the oven, if he is sharp he will eat his fill then;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If his Chaburah wants to do a favor for him, they sit next to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> His Chaburah is not obligated to do so - he cannot say, you accepted [to eat with] me!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No - they can say 'we accepted you to toil for us, not that we should toil for you'! (They cannot say that they did not accept a fast eater - since they did not investigate, this shows that they are not concerned for this.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> If a member of a Chaburah eats quickly, the Chaburah can tell him to take his share and eat elsewhere;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Moreover, even five people who made a joint meal at any time can say so [to the fast eater].</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a bigger Chidush:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Not only regarding Pesach, about which they say 'We accepted you to help with the Korban [but not to eat more than us]' - rather, even regarding a joint meal for mere company [he cannot say that they accepted him to eat as much as he wants].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> Surely, a Chaburah may expel a fast eater - we did not ask about this (surely, they accepted him only to help with the Korban);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather - may a Chaburah split up?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a member of a Chaburah eats quickly, the Chaburah can tell him to take his share and eat elsewhere.</p></div>
