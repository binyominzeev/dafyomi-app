<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Yosi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The Tzitz is Meratzeh for Achilos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, it is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We are thinking that since R. Yosi says that it is not Meratzeh for Achilos, he holds like R. Yehoshua who requires blood and meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No, it is even like R. Yosi - he holds like R. Eliezer, who permits Zerikah even if the meat is not intact.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why would we need the Tzitz to Meratzeh for Achilos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> R. Eliezer does not require meat to Zorek, yet he says that the Tzitz is Meratzeh for Achilos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say, the meat is considered Tahor to enable it to become Pigul, and to uproot Me'ilah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Eliezer holds that the Tzitz is Meratzeh for Achilos - Me'ilah does not apply [after Zerikah], and the meat can become Pigul [if there was intent Chutz li'Zmano] as if it was Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi holds that it is not Meratzeh for Achilos - the meat is considered Tamei, Me'ilah applies, and it cannot become Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Mari):</span> Even if R. Yosi holds like R. Eliezer [who does not require meat to Zorek], this does not explain everything!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Granted, we may offer blood of Zevachim (the Tzitz is Meratzeh), a Kometz from the Omer, and the Levonah [to permit Lechem ha'Panim] - but Shtei ha'Lechem should be totally eaten [and this is forbidden - it what sense can they be offered?]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah permits bringing b'Tum'ah the Korbanos brought with Shtei ha'Lechem!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, there would be only four, for Zivchei Shalmei Tzibur are brought with Shtei ha'Lechem, and these were counted as <i>another</i> one of the five!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (of Suggestion (a)):</span> Rather, R. Yosi holds that Tum'ah is Hutrah b'Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> For seven days beforehand, we sprinkle on both [a Kohen who will burn Parah Adumah and a Kohen Gadol who will serve on Yom Kipur] with Mei Chatas from every Parah Adumah burned previously;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi says, we sprinkle only on days three and seven.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Tum'ah is Hutrah b'Tzibur, we need not sprinkle at all (Tosfos Yoma 8A - since we do not know that he is Tamei)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> R. Yosi contradicts himself!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Nir'eh (I hold like) R. Eliezer regarding Zevachim and Menachos, and like R. Yehoshua regarding Zevachim and Menachos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding Zevachim I hold like R. Eliezer, who permits [offering] blood even without meat, and like R. Yehoshua, who says that each is Me'akev the other;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Regarding Menachos I hold like R. Eliezer, who permits [offering] the Kometz even if the Shirayim are not intact, and like R. Yehoshua, who says that each is Me'akev the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> R. Yosi [does not say that he agrees with each of them in both places, rather,] he says that presumably they argue about both:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When he saw that they argue regarding Zevachim, he says that presumably, they argue similarly about Menachos; when he saw that they argue regarding Menachos, he says that presumably, they argue similarly about Zevachim (the Tana put both statements together - Tosfos Rid).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> I understand the first part - but why did he say that <i>presumably</i> they argue about Zevachim like about Menachos - the verses they argue about (77A, "V'Dam Zevachecha Yishpoch" and "V'Asisa Olosecha ha'Basar veha'Dam") refer to Zevachim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, R. Yosi holds like R. Eliezer regarding Tum'ah [of meat or Menachos], and like R. Yehoshua regarding when they are burned or lost.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Presumably, he holds like R. Eliezer regarding Tum'ah because the Tzitz is Meratzeh - but R. Yosi holds that the Tzitz is not Meratzeh for Achilos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, R. Yosi holds like R. Eliezer regarding a Tzibur, and like R. Yehoshua regarding an individual.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tum'ah is Hutrah for the Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> We showed that R. Yosi holds that Tum'ah is Nidcheh (not Hutrah) for the Tzibur!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> We said that also R. Yehoshua is Machshir for the Tzibur!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">78b----------------------------------------78b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Rather, R. Yosi holds like R. Eliezer b'Di'eved, and like R. Yehoshua l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> In the Mishnah [cited on 77B] R. Yehoshua agrees that if Zerikah was done, it was Meratzeh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only regarding Tum'ah, but not regarding when they are burned or lost;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi holds like R. Eliezer b'Di'eved regarding when they are burned or lost.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IS EATING KORBAN PESACH ME'AKEV?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the meat [of Pesach] became Tamei and the Chelev is intact, we do not Zorek;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Chelev became Tamei and the meat is intact, we Zorek;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Other Zevachim are different - even if the meat became Tamei and the Chelev is intact, we Zorek.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> If Zerikah was done, it was Meratzeh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Pesach must be eaten!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Eating is not Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says "Ish l'Fi Ochlo"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is Me'akev!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "B'Michsas" - this teaches that Pesach is slaughtered only for Menuyav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if it was slaughtered Lo li'Mnuyav, this is like one who transgressed a Mitzvah, but it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ish l'Fi Ochlo <i>Tachosu</i>" (this connotes counting) - the repetition teaches that it is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The verse equates Ochlav with Minuy (just like slaughter li'Mnuyav is Me'akev, also l'Ochlav)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav holds like R. Noson, who says that eating Pesach is not Me'akev. (We will give another answer on the coming Daf.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that R. Noson says this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa - R. Noson) Question:</span> What is the source that all of Yisrael can be Yotzei with one Korban Pesach [even though there will not be a k'Zayis for everyone]?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> "V'Shochatu <i>Oso Kol Kehal</i> Adas Yisrael" - does all of Yisrael slaughter [one Pesach]?!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, [it is as if everyone slaughtered] - this teaches that everyone can be Yotzei with one Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There is different, for each person has potential to get and eat a k'Zayis if others would withdraw.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If a Chaburah was Nimneh on a Pesach (everyone acquired a k'Zayis), and then a second Chaburah was Nimneh on it [each of them acquired less than k'Zayis], the first Chaburah is Yotzei, for everyone gets a k'Zayis; the second Chaburah [is not Yotzei, it] must bring Pesach Sheni, for everyone does not get a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Noson says, neither needs to bring Pesach Sheni, for Zerikah was done for both of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Here also, the second Chaburah could get and eat a k'Zayis if the first Chaburah would withdraw!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If that is the reason, R. Noson would have said so;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, he said that the reason is that Zerikah was done for them - this shows that it depends only on the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What forced Rav to establish our Mishnah to discuss l'Chatchilah, like R. Noson - he should have said that it disqualifies even b'Di'eved, like Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He found the Mishnah difficult:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say that we do not Zorek? It should say that it is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> L'Chatchilah we do not Zorek, but b'Di'eved it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Noson expound "Ish l'Fi Ochlo"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The person must be able to eat.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN DO CHACHAMIM AND R. NOSON AGREE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Pesach was slaughtered Lo l'Ochlav and Zerikah was done Lo l'Ochlav, it is Kosher and one is Yotzei with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is like R. Noson; it is unlike Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is even like Chachamim - intent for who will eat it does not affect Zerikah ("Ish l'Fi Ochlo" discusses slaughter).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If someone was sick at the time of slaughter and healthy at the time of Zerikah or vice-versa, we do not slaughter and Zorek for him unless he is healthy from slaughter through Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is like Chachamim; it is unlike R. Noson.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is even like R. Noson - [he does not require that the Pesach be edible, but] he requires that the person be able to eat [like he expounded above].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If it was slaughtered b'Taharah and then the owners became Tamei, we Zorek b'Taharah; the owners may not eat it b'Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> It is only like R. Noson.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is even like Chachamim - the case is, most of the Tzibur became Tamei, they bring Pesach b'Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the meat may be eaten b'Tum'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a decree, lest the owners (Rashi's text - Tzibur) become Tamei next year after Zerikah, and they will think that they may eat, just like they ate the previous year even though they became Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They will not realize that they were permitted only because they were Tamei at the time of Zerikah - but one who was Tahor at the time of Zerikah may not eat b'Tum'ah.</p></div>
