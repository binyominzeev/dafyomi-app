<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since "Va'Araltem..." forbids all Hana'ah, why does it say "Lachem"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Lachem" includes a tree planted for the public (Orlah applies to it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it excludes a tree planted for the public.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "U'Ntatem" connotes only a tree planted for an individual - therefore, "Lachem" includes trees planted for the public.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "U'Ntatem" connotes a tree planted for an individual or for the public, and also Lachem connotes both of these;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There are two Ribuyim (sources to include trees planted for the public) - two Ribuyim [for the same thing] come to exclude.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against R. Avahu):</span> Regarding Terumah it says "V'Chol Zar Lo Yochal Kodesh," yet a Zar may benefit from it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may make an Eruv [Techumim - Tosfos; Rashi - or Eruv Chatzeros] on behalf of a Nazir with wine, and on behalf of a Yisrael with Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> One may benefit from Terumah because it says "Terumaschem" - it will be yours [to benefit from].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Chizkiyah, why does it say "Terumaschem"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It discusses Terumah of all of Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against both of them):</span> Regarding a Nazir it says "Me'Chartzanim v'Ad Zag Lo Yochal," yet the Mishnah permitted making an Eruv for a Nazir with wine!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mar Zutra):</span> It says "Nizro" - [benefit is permitted] to him;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> "Kodesh Yihyeh Gadel Pera Se'ar Rosho" - only his hair is Kodesh, no other Isur Nazir is Asur b'Hana'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The verse does not say that only his hair is Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must rely on Answer #1.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against R. Avahu):</span> Regarding Chodosh [which is forbidden until the Omer is brought] it says "V'Lechem v'Kali v'Charmel Lo Sochlu Ad Etzem ha'Yom ha'Zeh" [yet one may benefit from it]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may harvest [Chodosh] fodder and feed it to animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shemayah):</span> There is different for it says "Ketzirchem" - the harvest is yours [to benefit from].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Chizkiyah, why does it say  "Ketzirchem"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It discusses the harvest of all of Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BENEFIT FROM SHERATZIM, CHAMETZ AND CHELEV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against both of them):</span> Regarding Sheratzim it says "Sheketz Hu Lo Ye'achel," yet one may benefit from them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If hunters of Chayos, birds and fish happened to catch Tamei species, they may sell them to Nochrim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different for it says "Lachem" - they are yours [to benefit from them].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should be permitted to hunt them l'Chatchilah (the Mishnah permits only if one happened to catch them)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Yihyu" - they will be in their status (you will detest them).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Chizkiyah, why does it say "Lo Ye'achel" [which normally forbids Hana'ah] and "Lachem" to permit - it should forbid eating with a different word, and "Lachem" would not be needed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is Chizkiyah's source [that "Lo Ye'achel" forbids Hana'ah - we know this because the Torah needed to write Lachem to permit Hana'ah]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Lo Ye'achel Chametz," yet some permit Hana'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> Hana'ah from Chametz is permitted during Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "V'Lo Yera'eh Lecha" - this teaches that it is yours [to benefit from it].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Chachamim [who forbid Hana'ah] expound V'Lo Yera'eh Lecha - but you may see Chametz of others or of Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Gelili learns this from a second verse that says "Lecha."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Chachamim use the second "Lecha" to permit even a Nochri who is under your control and lives with you in the Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Gelili learns this from a third verse "Lecha."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Chachamim require separate verses to teach about Chametz and Se'or - we could not learn one from the other (perhaps Se'or is more stringent, for it causes other things to ferment; perhaps Chametz is more stringent, it is fit to eat).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue as R. Avahu and Chizkiyah do:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "[V'Chelev...] Ye'aseh <i>l'Chol</i> Melachah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> One might have thought that it is permitted only for needs of Hekdesh, but not for Chulin uses - this permits even Chulin uses;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Akiva):</span> One might have thought that it is Tahor only for Chulin, but not for Hekdesh - this is Metaher even for Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yosi does not need a verse to teach about Tum'ah and Taharah, only about Heter Hana'ah (permission to benefit); R. Akiva does not need a verse to teach about Heter Hana'ah, only about Tum'ah and Taharah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (Regarding Chelev it says "Lo Sochlu Chol Neveilah.") R. Yosi holds that "Lo Sochlu" forbids eating and Hana'ah [like R. Avahu], therefore we need a verse to permit Hana'ah; R. Akiva holds that "Lo Sochlu" forbids only eating, but not Hana'ah [like Chizkiyah] - therefore, "Ye'aseh l'Chol Melachah" teaches about Taharah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree that it forbids even Hana'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi holds that the verse that permits Hana'ah from a Neveilah ("La'Ger...Titnenah") does not permit benefit from the Chelev and Gid [which are forbidden even in slaughtered animals] - therefore, "Ye'aseh..." permits the Chelev;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva holds that when the Torah permitted [Hana'ah from] a Neveilah, it permitted even the Chelev and the Gid - therefore, "Ye'aseh..." comes to Metaher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yosi ha'Gelili, this verse permits Hana'ah from Chelev - but will he forbid Hana'ah from the Gid?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, he forbids!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He permits it from a Kal va'Chomer:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Eating Chelev is a Lav with Kares, yet one may benefit from it - eating the Gid is only a Lav, all the more so one may benefit from it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p>R. Shimon (22A) forbids Hana'ah - he refutes the Kal va'Chomer because Chelev is totally permitted in Chayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi learns the Kal va'Chomer regarding Behemos [therefore he does not consider this a refutation] - Chelev of Behemos is never permitted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHAT THEY ARGUE ABOUT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We answered all of the questions - in conclusion, what do R. Avahu and Chizkiyah argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about Chametz during Pesach according to Chachamim, and Shor ha'Niskal according to everyone - Chizkiyah forbids them on account of "Lo Ye'achel," R. Avahu learns from Neveilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Both of them forbid Hana'ah - practically, what do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They argue about Chulin slaughtered in the Mikdash (no verse directly discusses it):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chizkiyah holds that "Lo Ye'achel" forbids these (Chametz and Shor ha'Niskal); "[La'Kelev Tashlichun] Oso" [permits Hana'ah from a Tereifah, but] excludes Chulin b'Azarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Avahu holds that "Oso" forbids these (it implies that other Isurei Achilah are Asur b'Hana'ah); he holds that Chulin b'Azarah is permitted mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>(A Talmid citing R. Yehoshua ben Levi) Question: What is the source that all Isurei Achilah are also Asur b'Hana'ah, i.e. Chametz b'Pesach and Shor ha'Niskal?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should learn from "Lo Ye'achel"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that "Lo Ye'achel" only connotes Isur Achilah, but not Isur Hana'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should learn from Neveilah (a verse is needed to permit benefit from it - this implies that other Isurei Achilah are also Asur b'Hana'ah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like R. Yehudah, who says that the verse of Neveilah specifies how to benefit (a gift to a Ger or selling to a Nochri, but not vice-versa).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should learn from R. Yehudah's source - "La'Kelev Tashlichun Oso"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that Chulin b'Azarah is forbidden mid'Oraisa [from this verse].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>(The Talmid citing R. Yehoshua ben Levi) Answer #1 - Question: "V'Chol Chatas Asher Yuva mi'Damah...[Lo Se'achel] <i>ba'Esh Tisaref</i>" - what do we learn from this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It need not teach that we burn a Chatas [if its blood was brought inside the Heichal] - it says [regarding the goat burned on the day of Chanukas ha'Mishkan] "V'Hine Soraf"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we use it to teach about other things forbidden [to eat] - since we do not need this to learn Isur Achilah, we learn Isur Hana'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like the Chatas was burned, we should say that all Isurim must be burned!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "<i>Ba'Kodesh</i>...ba'Esh Tisaref" - Pasul Kodshim are burned, other Isurim are not.</p></div>
