<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IT IS GOOD TO EAT FRUGALLY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>'Stam' R. Yitzchak (i.e. without mention of his father's name) regarding Halachah is R. Yitzchak ben Acha; Stam R. Yitzchak regarding Agadata (non-Halachic teachings) is R. Yitzchak ben Pinchas;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A way to remember this - "<i>Shema</i>'uni <i>Achai</i> v'Ami" (Divrei ha'Yamim 1:28:2; R. Yitzchak ben <i>Acha</i> taught <i>Shemata</i> (Halachah)).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Eat Batzel (onions), and you will sit b'Tzel (in the shade) of your house (eat frugally, and you will not need to sell your house);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Do not eat geese and chickens, for [they are expensive and] then you will always crave them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Decrease your eating and drinking, and spend more on your house.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> One who eats Alyah (the fat tail, which is expensive) hides himself [from creditors] in the Aliyah (attic); one who eats Kakuli (vegetables, which are cheap) can sit on the Kiklei (dumps) of the city (where everyone goes - he need not hide).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DO WE BLESS FIRST ON THE WINE OR ON THE DAY?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> They mix the first cup of wine - he blesses [in Kidush] Kedushas ha'Yom, and then Borei Peri ha'Gafen;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Beis Hillel says, he blesses on the wine, and then on the day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> The following is one of the things Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argue about in a meal:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai say, [in Kidush] first we bless on the day, then on the wine, because the day (Shabbos or Yom Tov) is the reason we have wine; also, the day came before the wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, we bless on the wine first, because we say Kidush only because we have wine (indeed, Kidush can be made on bread - in that case, the bread is in place of wine, one blesses on it first);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Also - the Berachah on wine is more Tadir [frequent] than the Berachah on the day - Tadir comes first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The Halachah follows Beis Hillel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Beis Hillel need to give a second reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since Beis Shamai give two reasons, the Halachah follows them - therefore, Beis Hillel give a second reason.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Beraisa need to say that the Halachah follows Beis Hillel - this is obvious, a Bas Kol announced that the Halachah [always] follows Beis Hillel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This Beraisa was taught before the Bas Kol.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This Beraisa is like R. Yehoshua, who says that we do not heed a Bas Kol.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>EATING A VEGETABLE AND MAROR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [After Kidush, we dip and eat a vegetable, to arouse children to ask why tonight is different - this step of the Seder is called Karpas;] they bring to him [vegetables. If the only one available is Chazeres (Romaine lettuce)] he dips Chazeres [and eats it now] before eating Matzah [after which he eats Chazeres for the Mitzvah of Maror].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>[After Karpas,] Matzah, Chazeres, Charoses and two cooked foods are brought in front of him, even though Charoses is not a Mitzvah (this will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok says, it is a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>In [the time of] the Mikdash, they would bring the meat of the Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">114b----------------------------------------114b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Reish Lakish):</span> Our Mishnah teaches that Mitzvos require intent:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since the first time he ate Chazeres it was not the time for the Mitzvah of Maror, and he blessed Borei Peri ha'Adamah as usual for a vegetable, perhaps he did not intend for the Mitzvah of Maror - therefore, he must eat Maror again afterwards.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Mitzvos did not require intent, there would be no need to dip [and eat] it again, he was already Yotzei the first time!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Perhaps Mitzvos do not require intent - he must dip again to arouse the children!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Mishnah does not teach that Mitzvos require intent, it should discuss eating a different vegetable [before the Matzah]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it discussed another vegetable, we would have thought that two dippings are done only when one has another vegetable - therefore the Mishnah teaches that even if he has only Chazeres, he dips twice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Beraisa):</span> If one ate [Maror of] Demai, he was Yotzei [since he could Mafkir his property and become poor, and then it would be permitted to him];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he ate without intent or half at a time, he was Yotzei, as long as he did not delay between one eating and another (Mishnah Berurah 475:42 - really, it means from the beginning to the end) the time to eat a half-loaf (opinions of this time vary between two and nine minutes).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about this:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Even though he dipped [and ate] Chazeres [for Karpas], it is a Mitzvah to bring Chazeres, Charoses and two cooked foods.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps R. Yosi holds that Mitzvos do not require intent - he dips again to arouse the children, like we said above!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, he would not call bringing Chazeres a <i>Mitzvah</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the two cooked foods?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> Even beets and rice may be used [all the more so, meat dishes].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rava strove to use beets and rice, because [he wanted to show that the Halachah follows Rav Huna, and] Rav Huna said these.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Ashi):</span> This shows that no one is concerned for the opinion of R. Yochanan ben Nuri:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> Rice is a grain; [if it became Chametz] one is Chayav Kares for eating it on Pesach; one may be Yotzei with rice Matzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chizkiyah):</span> Even fish with an egg on top suffices (it counts like two cooked foods).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Yosef):</span> Two kinds of meat (R. Chananel - roasted and cooked) are required to commemorate the Korban Pesach and Chagigah [of the 14th].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Ravina):</span> Even meat and the gravy in which it was cooked suffice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>The following is obvious - if one has a vegetable (in addition to Maror), he blesses Borei Peri ha'Adamah on the vegetable [at Karpas], and 'Al Achilas Maror' on the Maror;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one has only lettuce [or another species of Maror], how does he bless the two times he eats it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> The first time he blesses Borei Peri ha'Adamah; the second time he blesses Al Achilas Maror.</p></div>
