<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Perhaps you should learn oppositely! Haza'ah is only Shevus, yet it is not Docheh Shabbos - slaughtering is a Melachah, all the more so it is not Docheh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> You are uprooting the verse "B'Mo'ado" - whether Erev Pesach is on a weekday or Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> ["B'Mo'ado" refers to the fixed time for slaughter -] it does not say "B'Mo'ado" regarding these [Shevusim - they could have been done before Shabbos]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> The general rule is, any Melachah which could be done before Shabbos is not Docheh; slaughter could not be done before Shabbos, therefore it is Docheh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Benei Beseira (one of them was the Nasi, the 'king' of the Chachamim) forgot this Halachah [that slaughter is Docheh Shabbos];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Once, Erev Pesach occurred on Shabbos, and they did not remember whether or not Korban Pesach is Docheh. People suggested that Hillel, who had come from Bavel, would know - he had served two leaders of the generation, Shemayah and Avtalyon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Hillel:</span> Is Pesach the only Korban that is Docheh Shabbos?! There are more than 200 [Korbanos like] Pesachim that are Docheh every year (Temidim and Musafim of Shabbos)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Benei Beseira):</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Hillel):</span> It says "B'Mo'ado" regarding Pesach, just like regarding the Tamid - just like the Tamid is Docheh Shabbos, also Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Hillel):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches this - there is no Kares for [not bringing] the Tamid, nevertheless it is Docheh Shabbos - there is Kares for [not bringing] Pesach, all the more so it is Docheh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>They appointed Hillel to be Nasi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Hillel expounded laws of Pesach the entire day; he began to provoke [the Chachamim] verbally:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What caused that I came from Bavel to become your Nasi? Your laziness - you did not serve the two greatest Chachamim of the generation, Shemayah and Avtalyon!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If someone forgot to bring a knife [to the Azarah] before Shabbos, how may he bring it on Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Hillel:</span> I heard this and forgot it (this was his punishment for the tinge of haughtiness he showed when rebuking them) - leave it to Yisrael to find a solution - if they are not Nevi'im, they are Benei Nevi'im (people training to be prophets).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>On Erev Pesach, everyone inserted the knife in the wool if his Korban was a lamb, or in the horns if it was a goat (everyone who had forgotten to bring it beforehand did so; alternatively, they planned to bring them this way - they did so even when Erev Pesach was a Yom Chol - Tosfos Rid);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Hillel remembered that he learned this from Shemayah and Avtalyon.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SOURCE THAT PESACH OVERRIDES SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It says "B'Mo'ado" regarding Pesach, just like regarding the Tamid - just like the Tamid is Docheh Shabbos, also Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the Tamid is Docheh Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "B'Mo'ado" connotes even on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, this would directly teach about Pesach, regarding which it also says "B'Mo'ado" - but we needed to learn Pesach from Tamid! We must say that "B'Mo'ado" does not connote 'even on Shabbos' regarding Pesach or Tamid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Olas Shabas b'Shabato Al Olas ha'Tamid" (Musaf of Shabbos is offered in addition to the Tamid) - this shows that the Tamid is offered on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Kal va'Chomer also teaches this - there is no Kares for the Tamid, nevertheless it is Docheh - there is Kares for Pesach, all the more so it is Docheh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This can be challenged - the Tamid is Tadir (brought more regularly) and is totally offered on the Mizbe'ach - these do not apply to Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> First, Hillel answered with this Kal va'Chomer; after they refuted it, he learned from the Gezeirah Shavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he had a [tradition for the] Gezeirah Shavah, why did he answer with a Kal va'Chomer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He addressed them according to their reasoning:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>I have a [tradition for a] Gezeirah Shavah - apparently, you do not [or else you would have known the law], and you cannot learn a Gezeirah Shavah without a tradition - but you yourselves should have made this Kal va'Chomer!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Benei Beseira:</span> The Kal va'Chomer is refuted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> On Erev Pesach, they inserted the knives in the wool or horns.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">66b----------------------------------------66b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is working with Kodshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They did like Hillel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When Hillel was Nasi, nobody transgressed Me'ilah with his Olah - everyone would bring it to the Mikdash while it was Chulin, Makdish it, do Semichah and slaugher it [immediately].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One cannot Makdish Pesach on Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are forbidden on Yom Tov, all the more so on Shabbos - to Makdish, to Ma'arich (pledge to Hekdesh an amount of money based on the age and gender of a person), to make Cherem (Hekdesh to Bedek ha'Bayis or to be given to Kohanim), and to separate Terumos and Ma'aseros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One may not Makdish [even] an obligatory Korban which does not have a fixed time [e.g. Nedarim], but one may Makdish an obligatory Korban with a fixed time [like Pesach];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One may Makdish a Pesach on Shabbos or a Chagigah (the Shelamim one must bring on each festival) on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This (causing animals to carry or do other Melachah on Shabbos)] is forbidden on account of Mechamer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These are unskillful [ways to carry loads - Tosfos Yeshanim (Yoma 66, printed on 69A-B). Rashi - goats and sheep do not normally carry loads - see note in Appendix.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, this is permitted mid'Oraisa, but it is forbidden mid'Rabanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was the question - may someone transgress Shevus unskillfully for the sake of a Mitzvah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Hillel said that he heard this and forgot it - leave it to Yisrael to find a solution - if they are not Nevi'im, they are Benei Nevi'im!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THINGS LOST THROUGH HAUGHTINESS AND ANGER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Chacham or Navi gets haughty, his Chachmah or prophecy will depart;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn about a Chacham from Hillel - he began to provoke them verbally, and later he said 'I heard this and forgot it'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We learn about a Navi from Devorah - [she praised herself above previous leaders,] "Chadlu Ferazon b'Yisrael Chadelu Ad sha'Kamti Devorah sha'Kamti Em b'Yisrael" - later, it says "Uri Uri Devorah Uri Uri Dabri Shir [Kum Barak u'Shave Shevyecha]" (to arouse herself to regain prophecy, which she had lost, she attributed the praise to Barak).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If a Chacham or Navi gets angry, his Chachmah or prophecy will depart;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn about a Chacham from Moshe - "Va'Yiktzof Moshe Al Pekudei he'Chayil" (he was angry that the army didn't kill Benos Midyan), and it says "Va'Yomer Elazar...Zos Chukas ha'Torah Asher Tzivah Hash-m Es Moshe," implying that Moshe forgot [to tell them to Kasher Kelim];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We learn about a Navi from Elisha - [he told Yehoram, normally I would not look at an idolator like you -] "Lulei Pnei Yehoshafat...Im Abit Elecha"; [he lost his prophecy for this -] "V'Atah Kechu Li Menagen...va'Tehi Alav Ru'ach Hash-m." (Seemingly, we could also learn about a Navi from Moshe! Perhaps one might have thought that only Moshe's prophecy, which was more intense and required more Kedushah than that of other Nevi'im, would be lost on account of anger - <b>PF</b>.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Mani bar Patish):</span> If one gets angry, even if greatness was apportioned [but not yet given] to him from Shomayim, he will lose it - we learn from Eli'av:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Va'Yichar Af Eli'av b'David"... - when Shmuel went to anoint a son of Yishai, regarding the other sons it says "Ba'Zeh Lo Vachar Hash-m," but regarding Eli'av it says "Mi'astihu," implying that Hash-m initially desired him [but rejected him because there was a source of anger in his heart which would later come out - the anointing preceded Eli'av's anger].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PESACH MAY BE BROUGHT B'TUM'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have learned that Tamid and Pesach are Docheh Shabbos - what is the source that they may be brought b'Tum'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like we learn Pesach from Tamid regarding Dichuy Shabbos, we learn Tamid from Pesach regarding Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Pesach may be brought b'Tum'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> "Ish Ish Ki Yihyeh Tamei la'Nefesh" - an Ish (individual) is detained to Pesach Sheni, but a Tzibur is not - rather, the Tzibur brings it b'Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Reish Lakish):</span> Perhaps an Ish is detained to Pesach Sheni, but there is no compensation for a Tzibur!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> Rather, we learn from "Vi'Shalchu Min ha'Machaneh Kol Tzaru'a v'Chol Zav v'Chol Tamei la'Nefesh."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should have said only Tamei la'Nefesh - we would know that all the more so, Zavim (people Tamei on account of emissions - see note in Appendix for Daf 67A) and Metzora'im must be sent from the Machaneh! (Later we will explain why they are more stringent.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that there is a time when Metzora'im and Zavim are sent from the Machaneh, but a Tamei Mes is not, i.e. Pesach brought b'Tum'ah.</p></div>
