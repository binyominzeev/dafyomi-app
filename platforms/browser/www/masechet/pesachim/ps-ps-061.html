<p class="dedicationbox">PESACHIM 61 (8 Shevat) -Â Dedicated in honor of the birthday of Gila Linzer. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SHINUY BA'ALIM IS UNLIKE LO LISHMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Lo Lishmah is a Pesul [of intent] in the Korban itself, it applies to all four Avodos, it applies after death of the owner (if his son brings the Korban), and it applies to the congregation as well as an individual - you cannot learn to Shinuy Ba'alim, which is not a Pesul in the Korban itself, does not apply to all four Avodos (except for Pesach, it applies only to Zerikah), does not apply after death, and does not apply to the congregation, only to individuals!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Even though two of these are not proper objectios, two of them are proper;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shinuy Ba'alim is not a Pesul in the Korban itself, it is a Pseul of intent - the same applies to Lo Lishmah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rava said that Shinuy Ba'alim does not apply after death - but Rav Pinchas brei d'Rav Ami holds that it applies after death!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>However, the other two are proper objections.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, if Pesach was slaughtered any other day b'Shinuy Ba'alim, it is as if it was slaughtered without owners in its time - it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SLAUGHTER FOR PEOPLE WHO CANNOT EAT PESACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Pesach was slaughtered for the following, it is Pasul - Lo l'Ochlav (people who cannot eat), Lo li'Mnuyav (they do not own a share), Arelim or Temei'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If it was slaughtered l'Ochlav and Lo l'Ochlav, li'Mnuyav and Lo li'Mnuyav, for Mulim (circumcised men) and Arelim, or for Temei'im and Tehorim it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If it was slaughtered before midday it is Pasul, for it says "Bein ha'Arbayim";</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If it was slaughtered before the Tamid it is Kosher, but someone must mix the blood [so it will not congeal] until [it is thrown] after Zerikah of the Tamid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Zerikah [of a Pesach] was done [before that of the Tamid], it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the case of Lo l'Ochlav?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was for a sick or elderly person [who cannot eat a k'Zayis].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Lo li'Mnuyav is when one Chaburah (a group that will eat Pesach) was Manuy on it, and it was slaughtered for another Chaburah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "B'Michsas" (this connotes counting; "...Tachosu" connotes slaughter, like Rebbi will explain) - this teaches that we slaughter Pesach only for those Menuyim on it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one who slaughtered it Lo li'Mnuyav transgressed, but it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "B'Michsas [Nefashos] <i>Tachoso</i>" (this also connotes counting) - the repetition teaches that it is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Rebbi says, Tachoso is a word of Sursi (Aramis, the language of Surya) - the root is Kos (slaughter).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about Lo li'Mnuyav - what is the source for Lo l'Ochlav?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ish l'Fi Ochlo Tachoso" - this equates those who can eat it to those who are Menuyim on it.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">61b----------------------------------------61b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If Pesach was slaughtered for Mulim to eat it, and in order that Arelim will fulfil their obligation through Zerikah, it is Pasul, because of the intent for Arelim in Zerikah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> It is Kosher - the intent for Arelim in Zerikah has no effect (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Support (Rabah, for himself - Beraisa) Suggestion: Perhaps an Arel is Posel the Pesach for the entire Chaburah [if it was slaughtered for everyone]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is unreasonable! Arelus is Posel, just like Tum'ah - partial Tum'ah (this will be explained) does not Posel like full Tum'ah, the same should apply to Arelus!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, we could say otherwise - Arelus is Posel, just like [intent to eat at the wrong] time - just like intent for [eating] part of the [meat at the wrong] time is [Posel] like intent for [eating] the entire [Korban at the wrong] time, also partial Arelus is Posel slaughter like full Arelus!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Decision:</span> It is more reasonable to learn Arelus from Tum'ah, for these do not Posel other Zevachim, and not from [intent to eat at the wrong] time, which is Posel all Zevachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should rather learn Arelus from time, for neither of these is ever totally permitted, and not from Tum'ah, which is totally permitted (Korbanos Tzibur may be brought b'Tum'ah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Zos [Chukas ha'Pesach" teaches that an Arel does not Posel the entire Chaburah].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from the verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot teach that a Chaburah of all Arelim is Posel, but not a Chaburah that is partially Arelim - we learn this from "V'Chol Arel [Lo Yochal Bo]"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Beraisa [is abbreviated, it] means as follows - "V'Chol Arel" teaches that partial Arelus [of a Chaburah] is not Posel, only full Arelus;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps full Arelus is also Posel regarding [intent for] Zerikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Zos" - it is Posel only [in one Avodah, i.e.] slaughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Zerikah more lenient?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Intent Lo l'Ochlav does not Posel Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>Rav Chisda explains just the contrary:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Chol Arel" teaches [regarding slaughter] that partial Arelus is not Posel, only full Arelus - but regarding Zerikah, even partial Arelus is Posel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps full Arelus is needed to Posel also regarding Zerikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Zos" - full Arelus is needed to Posel only regarding slaughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Zerikah more stringent?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Pigul is finalized only through Zerikah (because it is the last Avodah - if there is another Pesul in addition to Pigul in one of the four Avodos, it is not proper Pigul for which is one is Chayav Kares).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> What is the source to say that "V'Chol Arel" connotes that the entire Chaburah is uncircumcised? Perhaps it connotes that any amount of Arelus is Posel, and "Zos" teaches that only full Arelus is Posel, both regarding slaughter and Zerikah!</p></div>
