<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>RAV'S ADVICE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav (to Rav Asi):</span>  Do not live in a city in which horses and dogs are not heard (they are a deterrent - horses enable people to catch thieves);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Do not live in a city whose mayor is a doctor [or Chacham - he is too busy curing or learning to tend to needs of the city];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Do not marry two women [lest they plot against you] - if you married two, marry a third (if two plot against you, the third will tell you);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav (to Rav Kahana):</span> It is better to engage in a carcass than in conversation;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Flay a carcass in the market for wages; do not say 'I am the great Kahana, this is a disgrace for me!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Even when you go on a [short trip, e.g.] to the roof, take food with you, even if 100 gourds sell for a Zuz in the market (food is cheap).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav (to his son Chiya):</span> Do not drink potions [if there is an alternative medicine; alternatively, do not drink them regularly - they are expensive, and they help one ailment but are harmful in other ways);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Do not take a big step (it reduces one's eyesight - alternatively, do not jump over a stream); do not extract an [aching] tooth (it will eventually heal);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Do not provoke a snake or a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are three that one must [be extra careful] not to provoke - a young Nochri, a young snake and a young Talmid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Soon they will mature [and take vengeance].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav (to his son Eibo):</span> I toiled to teach Torah to you - I did not succeed; now I will teach you worldly matters:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When you foot is still in the sand (you just got off the boat), sell your merchandise [so you can quickly go on your next business venture];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>You can regret having sold anything [if it will later rise in price], except for wine (perhaps it would have soured);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Open your wallet [to take the money] before opening your sack [to give the merchandise];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>It is better to make a small profit nearby than a large profit far away;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>If you have dates, run to the beer brewer [otherwise you will eat them and lose them].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> For how many dates does this apply?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For [up to] three Sa'im (the volume of 432 eggs).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa or Rav Chisda):</span> Had I not brewed beer, I would not have become wealthy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a brewer called 'Sudna'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is a Sod Na'eh (a nice secret) and [gives one the means to do] Chesed (to give to drink; alternatively, with the earnings from it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Anything about which one must write a document (e.g. a loan) is burdensome to collect;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>If something is given on credit, it is doubtful if it will be paid for; even if it is paid, it will be in bad coins (i.e. a bit at a time, which is inconvenient).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan (citing people of Yerushalayim):</span> When you go to war [of Reshus - Ya'avetz], do not go at the front, rather, at the back, in order that you will be the first to return [if you must flee; Ein Eliyahu - do not think it is better to go at the front to get more spoils];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Make Shabbos like Chol [if you must], but do not take Tzedakah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Have financial dealings with someone who is prospering.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi (citing People of Yerushalayim):</span> Do not frequent the roof (you are visible there), on account of the episode (David took Bas Sheva because he saw her bathing on the roof);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If your daughter became a Bogeres [and is still single, marry her off immediately, even if you must] free your slave and marry her to him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Be careful lest your wife get too close to your first son-in-law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> We are concerned for adultery.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Kahana):</span> Perhaps she will freely give money to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>We are concerned for both of these.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHO IS BELOVED AND DESPISED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Three inherit the world to come - one who lives in Eretz Yisrael, one who raises his children to learn Torah, and one who makes Havdalah on wine on Motza'ei Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does making Havdalah on wine merit such a great reward?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he has limited wine, and he does not drink all of the wine of Kidush in order to save it for Havdalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Hash-m announces about [the greatness] of three people every day - a bachelor who dwells in a big city and does not sin, a poor person who returns a lost object, and a rich person who tithes covertly (he does not seek praise).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rav Safra was a bachelor living in a big city. Someone recited this teaching in front of Rava and Rav Safra - the latter started beaming.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">113b----------------------------------------113b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> It does not refer to you, rather, to people like R. Chanina and R. Oshaya, who were shoemakers in Eretz Yisrael in a market of harlots; they made shoes for the harlots. The harlots looked at them, but they did not lift their eyes to look at the harlots;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>People used to swear 'in the life of these holy Rabanan of Eretz Yisrael'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Hash-m loves three people - one who does not get angry, one who does not get drunk, and one who does not bear resentment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Hash-m hates three people - one who speaks insincerely, one who knows testimony but does not testify, and a lone witness who testifies about immorality:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A case occurred, Tuvya sinned and Zigud testified about him in front of Rav Papa - Rav Papa lashed Zigud.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Zigud:</span> Tuvya sinned - why did you lash me?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> It says "Lo Yakum Ed Echad b'Ish" - you testified alone (you are not believed -) the sole result of your testimony is to besmirch his reputation!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak):</span> One may hate a person [for transgressing Ervah]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Ki Sir'eh Chamor <i>Sona'acha</i> Rovetz..." - whom do you hate?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> The verse refers to a Yisrael, not a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to a Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may not hate a [proper] Yisrael - "V'Ohavta l'Re'echa Kamocha!"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, witnesses testified that he transgressed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he would not be called "Sona'<i>acha</i>" - everyone hates him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, you alone saw him transgress Ervah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is a Mitzvah to hate such a person - "Yir'as Hash-m Senos Ra."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Should one tell the transgressor's Rebbi, so he will hate him?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> One should do so only if the Rebbi believes you as if you were two witnesses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three people lead disturbed lives - people who are [overly] compassionate (they are troubled by everyone's troubles), irritable people, and finicky people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> All of these apply to me.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are three groups, that each member hates others in his group - dogs, roosters and Chaverim (a nation that came from or lived among Persians);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>Some say, even harlots.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>Some say, even Chachamim in Bavel (they bitterly attack (try to refute) each other in Halachah - Sanhedrin 24A. Ben Yehoyada - sometimes, the Neshamos of two Chachamim have the same source and they do not realize this - this causes hostility between them; in Eretz Yisrael, Chachamim have a Ru'ach ha'Kodesh to recognize this, and then they love each other.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are three groups, such that each loves others in his group - converts, slaves, and ravens.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>REPREHENSIBLE CONDUCT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Four people cannot be tolerated (even they cannot bear themselves after they repent) - a haughty poor person, a rich person who denies [that he owes money], an old person who is Mezaneh (even though his desire waned - Shabbos 152A), and a leader who aggrandizes himself over the community for naught (he does not help them when they are in need).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Some say, also one who divorces his wife and remarries her twice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The first Tana did not include this case - sometimes she has a large Kesuvah [and he cannot pay it] or he has children from her [and he remarries her because he cannot raise them himself].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>[Slaves act as if] Kena'an commanded his children five things - love each other, love theft, love Zenus, hate your masters, and do not say the truth. (Even though Benei Yisrael were commanded to kill the Kena'aniyim, children of Kena'aniyos fathered by other nations could be bought for slaves - Vayikra 25:45.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Six things were taught about a horse - it loves to mate, it loves war, it is haughty, it hates sleep, it eats much and excretes little;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Some say, it also seeks to kill its master in war.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Seven are [like] excommunicated to Shomayim - a Yisrael without a wife, one with a wife but without children [and he does not divorce her so he can marry someone else], one with children but he does not raise them to learn Torah, one without Tefilin on his head and arm, one without Tzitzis on his garment, one without a Mezuzah on his doorway, and one who does not wear shoes;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Some say, also one who does not eat at a meal celebrating a Mitzvah [such as circumcision].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TEACHINGS OF RABAH BAR BAR CHANAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yosi Ish Hutzal) Question: What is the source to forbid asking astrologers? (See Rashbam.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Tamim Tihyeh Im Hash-m Elokecha" (rely simply on Hash-m).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Reuven is greater than Shimon, even in only one matter, what is the source requiring Shimon to honor him?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol Kabel Di Ru'ach Yatira Be u'Malka Asis Lahakamose Al Kol Malchusa" (because Daniel was wiser, he was elevated over all the king's ministers).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Dam Tohar (postnatal blood - see note in Appendix for Daf 3A) is Tahor.) After the days of Dam Tohar end [we are concerned lest she will still think that her blood Tahor], how long must she wait before having relations [to remind her that if she sees blood, it makes her Nidah]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> She must wait one night (Rashbam).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following are the same person - Yosef Ish Hutzal, Yosef ha'Bavli, Isi ben Gur Aryeh, Isi ben Yehudah, Isi ben Gamliel, and Isi ben Mehalalel; his real name was Isi ben Akavya.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following are the same - R. Yitzchak ben Tavla, R. Yitzchak ben Chakla, and R. Yitzchak ben Ila'a.</p></div>
