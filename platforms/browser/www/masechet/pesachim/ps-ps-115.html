<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE MITZVOS OF MATZAH AND MAROR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Chisda):</span> It is unreasonable to bless Al Achilas Maror after he already ate it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> The first time he blesses Borei Peri ha'Adamah and Al Achilas Maror; the second time he does not bless. (Rashi - he is Yotzei Maror the first time; later he eats it to fulfill two dippings; Tosfos - he is Yotzei the second time, for he does not intend the first time; Mishnah Berurah - he may not speak about anything other than Hagadah in between.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>In Sura they followed Rav Huna; Rav Sheshes brei d'Rav Yehoshua followed Rav Chisda.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Halachah follows Rav Chisda.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rav Acha brei d'Rava strove to get another vegetable to avoid the dispute.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Mesharshiya brei d'Rav Noson):</span> Hillel had a tradition that nowadays (after the Churban) one should not wrap Matzah and Maror together to eat them - since Matzah is a Mitzvah mid'Oraisa and Maror is only mid'Rabanan, Maror is Mevatel Matzah (see note in Appendix).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Even the opinion that says that Mitzvos do not Mevatel each other says this only when both are mid'Oraisa or both are mid'Rabanan - but if one is mid'Oraisa and the other is mid'Rabanan, the mid'Rabanan is Mevatel the mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who says that Mitzvos do not Mevatel each other?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Hillel says so:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Hillel used to wrap Pesach, Matzah and Maror together and eat them - "Al Matzos u'Morerim Yochluhu" (none of these Mitzvos is Mevatel another, even though each may be a minority of the total).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Hillel's colleagues (presumably the majority, since the following Beraisa is Stam) disagree:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one wraps Pesach, Matzah and Maror together and eats them like Hillel did!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Al Matzos u'Morerim Yochluhu" (it could have said 'Yochlu' - rather, it says Yochluhu, we read this 'Yochal Hu'), one may even eat each by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (to Answer #1 - Rav Ashi):</span> If so (this Tana holds that Mitzvos Mevatel each other, he would have said that one <i>must</i> eat each by itself) - why does he say <i>even</i>? (We explain like Milchamos Hash-m.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> [All agree that Mitzvos do not Mevatel each other;] the Beraisa means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one <i>must</i> wrap Pesach, Matzah and Maror together like Hillel did to be Yotzei!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Al Matzos u'Morerim Yochluhu" - one may even eat each by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The Halachah was not fixed like Hillel, nor like Chachamim - [nowadays] we bless Al Achilas Matzah, eat Matzah, bless Al Achilas Maror, eat Maror, and then eat both together without a Berachah, to commemorate when there is a Mikdash, according to Hillel. (See note in Appendix.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WASHING FOR KARPAS AND MAROR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One must wash his hands before eating anything dipped in a liquid. (Mid'Rabanan, unwashed hands are a Sheni l'Tum'ah and they make liquids a Rishon.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Papa):</span> This teaches that one must [fully] submerge the lettuce in Charoses on account of Kapa (a poisonous sap or worm) inside;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">115b----------------------------------------115b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one need not submerge it, there would be no need to wash for it [when it is eaten - he could avoid touching the liquid in the Charoses]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps it suffices to dip it - the smell of the Charoses kills [or neutralizes] the Kapa. (Tosfos - one checks the lettuce, so there probably is not a worm inside, so it is not forbidden on account of eating worms; we are more stringent regarding danger.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why must one wash?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is in case one will submerge it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> One should not leave the Charoses on the Maror, lest its sweetness (it is made with apples) blunt the bitterness of the Maror (one must taste Maror to be Yotzei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> [Even though] one washed his hands for the first dipping, he washes for the second dipping.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> This refers to other days (he does not know that he will dip again) - but here (Seder night), he knows that he will dip again, he need not wash again.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> Just the contrary! It refers to here - but on other days, why should we assume that he dips twice?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> If it refers to here, why must he wash again? He already washed (knowing that he will dip again)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we say Hagadah (recount leaving Mitzrayim) and Hallel in between, perhaps he was distracted and touched [something that is Metamei the hands].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HALACHOS OF MATZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one swallowed Matzah [without chewing it], he was Yotzei (one need not taste it to be Yotzei); if he swallowed Maror, he was not Yotzei (Rashi's text - he was Yotzei, because he got some taste of Maror);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one swallowed Matzah and Maror, he was Yotzei Matzah (the Maror is not a Chatzitzah), but not Maror (he did not taste it at all).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one wrapped them in a Siv [a shoot that grows around date trees], he was not even Yotzei Matzah (the Siv is a Chatzitzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Simi Bar Ashi):</span> We put Matzah, Maror and Charoses in front of every person at the Seder (Tosfos - so everyone can taste immediately after the Berachah; Rashbam - this is only when everyone has his own table);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We remove the table only from the one who says Hagadah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> All of these are only in front of the one who says Hagadah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Halachah follows Rav Huna.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we remove the table?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> This is to arouse children to ask questions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Abaye was in front of Rabah - he saw that they removed the table from in front of him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> We still did not eat, and you remove the table already?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> You have exempted us from saying 'How different is tonight...(the four questions! Tosfos - Abaye also asked about other differences.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> "Lechem Oni" - bread over which Onim (we recite) things (Hallel and Hagadah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "Lechem Oni" - bread over which Onim many things;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Also - "Oni" is written without a Vov, so we can read it 'Ani' (a poor person) - just like an Ani has [only] a partial loaf, here also we eat from a partial loaf. (We bless on two full loaves [in addition to the partial loaf], like every Shabbos and Yom Tov meal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Also - normally, an Oni lights the oven and his wife bakes (they work together, lest the oven cool off and more wood will be needed) - here also, he lights the oven and she bakes [to avoid delays that could cause Chimutz].</p></div>
