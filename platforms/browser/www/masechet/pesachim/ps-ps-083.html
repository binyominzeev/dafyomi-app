<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN IS IBUR TZURAH REQUIRED? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Also R. Yosi ha'Gelili holds like them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> The verse ["V'Chol Chatas Asher Yuva mi'Damah"] teaches about an inner Chatas [whose blood is offered in the Heichal], that if it became Pasul it is burned in Beis ha'Birah, and one who eats it transgresses a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> What is your source to Posel Dam [of a regular] Chatas that entered the Heichal?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi ha'Gelili:</span> I learn from "Hen Lo Huva Es Damah El ha'Kodesh Penimah" - had it left "Penimah," or had its blood entered the Heichal, it should be burned [immediately. Just like we burn meat immediately on account of something else (blood), we burn immediately on account of a Pesul in the owners].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yochanan does not say that R. Yosi ha'Gelili holds like them - blood and meat are similar (therefore a Pesul in the blood is a Pesul ha'Guf, it is as if was in the meat), but the owner is a different entity!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHICH BONES MUST BE BURNED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Bones, sinews and Nosar of Pesach are burned on the 16th;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the 16th is Shabbos, they are burned on the 17th.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because burning Nosar does not override Shabbos or Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Mari bar Avuha):</span> Bones of Kodshim that once held Nosar [marrow] are Metamei hands, because they once held something forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> Bones, sinews and Nosar of Pesach are burned on the 16th.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of bones?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If they do not have marrow, why must they be burned - one may discard them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They have marrow.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If holding Nosar is significant, we understand why they must be burned - but if it is insignificant, why must they be burned? We could break them, remove the marrow and burn it, and discard the bones!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that holding Nosar is significant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps it is not significant - the Tana forbids breaking the bones because he expounds ["V'Etzem Lo Sishberu] Vo" - in a Kosher Pesach, or even in a Pasul Pesach (this includes after it is Nosar)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who leaves over meat of [even a] Tahor Pesach or breaks a bone of a Tamei Pesach is not lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Lav of breaking bones applies only if the Korban was once permitted [and then, it applies even after it is Nosar].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana who says that it depends on whether or not it was once permitted?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Yakov:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "[V'Etzem Lo Sishberu] <i>Vo</i>" - in a Kosher Pesach, not in a Pasul Pesach. (Tosfos - the next Tana'im explain [and argue according to] this Tana.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yakov says, it is forbidden to break bones if and only if it was once permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon permits in either case [if it is now Pasul].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> [Nosar] bones of Kodshim need not be burned (even if there is marrow inside - one may break the bone, remove and burn the marrow, and discard the bone] except for Pesach, lest one transgress [breaking a bone].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of the bones?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If they do not have marrow, why must they be burned?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They have marrow.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If holding Nosar was significant, also bones of Kodshim should need to be burned!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The case is, the bones were found Chalutzim (broken with the marrow removed);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is no Isur to break bones of [other] Kodshim - surely, they were broken [to eat the marrow] while it was permitted, so the bones never held Nosar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is Asur to break bones of [a Kosher] Pesach - surely, they were broken after the marrow was Nosar, so the bones held Nosar, therefore they must be burned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Zevid):</span> The case is, piles of bones were found, and the first ones inspected were Chalutzim;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">83b----------------------------------------83b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is no Isur to break bones of Kodshim - surely, all of them were broken to eat the marrow, so they need not be burned;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is Asur to break bones of Pesach - perhaps only these were Chalutzim (the Gemara (84A-B) will suggest eight situations in which one may break bones of Pesach) but the others were not - therefore [one must check them; if they have marrow], they must be burned. (We do not require burning Chalutzim bones on account of the Safek that they served Nosar.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH SINEWS MUST BE BURNED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> All sinews are considered meat (it is a Mitzvah to eat them and it is permitted to break them) except for sinews of the neck.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Bones, sinews and Nosar of Pesach are burned on the 16th.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of sinews?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The sinews cannot be considered meat - if so, they should be eaten!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they were left over.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is Nosar [which the Mishnah mentions separately]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It refers to sinews of the neck.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If they are considered meat, we understand why they must be burned (normally they are not eaten because they are hard) - but if they are not meat, why must they be burned?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question 1 - Rav Chisda):</span> The Mishnah refers to the Gid ha'Nasheh; it is like R. Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Only one Gid ha'Nasheh (the right or left) is forbidden - Da'as (understanding) dictates, it is the right Gid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We must say that R. Yehudah was not sure that the right one is forbidden [therefore both are forbidden, we burn them because one of them was truly permitted. He did not mean that Da'as <i>Torah</i> dictates that the right Gid is forbidden.]</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he was sure we would eat the permitted one and discard the forbidden one - we would not need to burn it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rav Ika bar Chanina):</span> [Really, he is sure -] the case is, the right and left Gidim became mixed and we do not know which is which, therefore we burn them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> We burn the fat surrounding the Gid ha'Nasheh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Mid'Oraisa, the fat around the Gid is permitted - Yisrael are Kedoshim, they do not eat it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #3 (Ravina):</span> We burn the outer Gid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The inner Gid, close to the bone, is forbidden mid'Oraisa, one who eats it is lashed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The outer Gid, close to the flesh, is forbidden [mid'Rabanan], one who eats it is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHY WE MAY NOT BURN NOSAR ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the 16th is Shabbos [they are burned on the 17th].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Ase to burn Nosar should Docheh the Lav [of burning on Yom Tov]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah) Question:</span> "Lo Sosiru Mimenu <i>Ad Boker</i> (do not leave over meat of the Pesach until the morning of the 15th) veha'Nosar Mimenu <i>Ad Boker</i> ba'Esh Tisrofu" - why is this repeated?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Nosar is burned on another morning [which is not Yom Tov, the 16th].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> "Olas Shabas b'Shabato" - but one may not burn on the Mizbe'ach [Eimurim of a weekday Korban, e.g.] an Olah of Chol (Erev Shabbos or Erev Yom Tov) on Shabbos or Yom Tov (i.e. at night; all the more so, one may not burn Pasul Kodshim on Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> "Hu Levado Ye'aseh Lachem" - "Hu" (Melachah of food preparation is permitted on Yom Tov), not Machshirim (making things used to prepare food, which could be done before Yom Tov);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Levado" - but not circumcision after day eight, which [if not for the verse] would have been permitted from a Kal va'Chomer. (Similarly, burning Nosar, which can be done another day, does not override Yom Tov.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> "Shabaton" - there is a Mitzvas Ase to rest on Yom Tov [in addition to the Lav of Melachah]; the Ase to burn Kodshim does not override a Lav and an Ase.</p></div>
