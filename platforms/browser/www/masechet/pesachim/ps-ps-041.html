<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> Do you refer to Charoses or mustard?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> What difference does it make? (No one distinguishes between them!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Rav Kahana distinguishes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> They argue about flour put into mustard - but all agree that if flour was put into Charoses it must be buried immediately.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> I disagree with Rav Kahana. (Tosfos - even though a Beraisa supports Rav Kahana, Rav Huna holds that the Mishnah is unlike him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Presumably, Rav Kahana is correct, for Shmuel taught that the Halachah does not follow R. Yosi [who says that if barley is inflating one soaks it in vinegar to impede Chimutz].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Vinegar does not impede Chimutz - rather, it is Mechametz!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps it does not impede Chimutz, nor does it Mechametz.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>KORBAN PESACH MUST BE ROASTED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not cook [Korban Pesach...]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "Ba'Mayim" forbids [cooking it in] water - what is the source to forbid other liquids?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches this:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Water does not lose its taste to the meat, nevertheless it is forbidden - other liquids lose their taste, all the more so they are forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rebbi):</span> We include other liquids from "U'Vashel Mevushal" - in any way.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about Tzeli Kedar (meat cooked in a pot in its own juice. Tosfos - Chachamim forbid but do not lash for [eating] it; Rebbi lashes for it. Rashi - Chachamim permit; Rebbi forbids.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound "U'Vashel Mevushal"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If one cooked the Pesach and then roasted it, or vice-versa, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand if he cooked it and then roasted it he is liable, for it was cooked;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But if he roasted it and then cooked it, it is "Tzeli Esh" (roasted) - why is he liable?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> The Beraisa is R. Yosi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One is Yotzei [Matzah even] with a wafer that was soaked [in water], or if it was cooked but did not dissolve;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, one is Yotzei with a soaked wafer, but not if it was cooked, even if it did not dissolve (it is no longer considered baked - likewise, if Tzeli was cooked it is no longer considered roasted)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> It is even like R. Meir - it says "U'Vashel Mevushal" to forbid if it was cooked at any time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is liable if it was fully (i.e. excessively) roasted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Al Tochlu Mimenu Na u'Vashel Mevushal ba'Mayim" - Na (partially roasted) and cooked are forbidden, fully roasted is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered fully roasted?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It was burned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is liable for eating a k'Zayis that is [totally] raw!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Al Tochlu Mimenu Na u'Vashel Mevushal" - Na and cooked are forbidden, raw is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps raw is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ki Im Tzeli Esh" (this is Lav shebi'Chlalos - the Tana exempts for it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered Na?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> This is what Persians call Avarnim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> One who cooks in hot spring water on Shabbos is exempt; if Pesach was cooked in such water [and one ate it], he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, he is exempt regarding Shabbos because it is not cooked by fire - for the same reason he should be exempt regarding Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Indeed, he is liable for "Ki Im Tzeli Esh" [but not for "U'Vashel Mevushal"; Rav Chisda is Mechayev for Lav shebi'Chlalos. The next version agrees, just in it Rav Chisda explains himself more.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Chiya brei d'Rav Noson - (Rav Chisda):</span> One who cooks in hot spring water on Shabbos is exempt; if Pesach was cooked in such water [and one ate it], he transgressed "[Ki Im] Tzeli Esh."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>LIABILITY FOR EATING PESACH THE WRONG WAY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one eats a Pesach partially roasted he is lashed twice [one set of 39 lashes for "Na," and one for "Ki Im Tzeli Esh;" if he eats it cooked, he is lashed twice [for "Mevushal" and "Ki Im Tzeli Esh"];</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he eats [a k'Zayis] Na and [a k'Zayis] cooked, he is lashed three times.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One is not lashed for a Lav shebi'Chlalos (such as "Ki Im Tzeli Esh," which forbids many things, i.e. all other ways of cooking).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Abaye exempts from additional lashes [for "Ki Im Tzeli Esh" when he is lashed for Na or Mevushal] - but he agrees that he is lashed once [for "Ki Im Tzeli Esh" when he is not lashed for Na or Mevushal, e.g. if it was cooked in hot spring water].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Abaye always exempts from lashes, because it is unlike the Lav of muzzling [from which we learn about lashes - it forbids just one thing].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a Nazir ate grape pits; he is lashed twice; if he ate grape skins, he is lashed twice; if he ate grape skins and pits, he is lashed three times ("Al Tochlu" applies to "Me'Chartzanim," "v'Ad Zag," and "mi'Kol Asher Ye'aseh mi'Gefen ha'Yayin");</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One is not lashed for a Lav shebi'Chlalos ("mi'Kol Asher Ye'aseh mi'Gefen ha'Yayin").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Abaye exempts from additional lashes [if he ate grape skins or pits and is lashed for them], but he agrees that he is lashed once [if he ate grape leaves];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Abaye always exempts from lashes, because it is unlike the Lav of muzzling.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If during the day [on Erev Pesach] one ate a k'Zayis Na, he is exempt; if at night he ate a k'Zayis Na, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>[One may not eat Pesach in two places or in two groups - nevertheless,] if one ate a k'Zayis roasted during the day [this is not considered eating, so] he did not disqualify himself from eating [at night] with his group.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if one ate during the day a k'Zayis Na he is liable - a Kal va'Chomer supports this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>At night, there is a Mitzvah to eat roasted, and one who eats Na is liable - during the day, there is no Mitzvah to eat roasted, all the more so one who eats Na should be liable!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or - perhaps [during the day] when there is no Mitzvah to eat roasted, there is a Lav not to eat Na - but [at night] when there is a Mitzvah to eat roasted, there is no Lav not to eat Na!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is not unreasonable - night is lenient, it is permitted to eat roasted then!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Al Tochlu Mimenu Na u'Vashel Mevushal ba'Mayim <i>Ki Im Tzeli Esh</i>" - this is extra (it already says "Tzeli Esh...Yochluhu"), to teach that the Lav of Na applies only when there is an Ase to eat roasted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rebbi):</span> It could have said 'Bashel' - why does it say "Mevushal"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> [Pesach is eaten at night, so] the primary Isur of Mevushal is at night - what is the source to forbid if it was cooked and eaten during the day (Maharsha - it was eaten at night)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "U'Vashel Mevushal".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi uses this to forbid Tzeli Kedar and cooking in other liquids!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the Torah only wanted to teach one matter (the method of cooking <i>or</i> the time), it would have written 'Bashel Bashel' or 'Mevushal Mevushal' - rather, it wrote "U'Vashel Mevushal" to teach both.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If during the day one ate a k'Zayis roasted, he is liable; if at night he ate a k'Zayis Na, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Beraisa teaches roasted together with Na - just like a Lav forbids Na, a Lav forbids roasted [eaten during the day]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, "Al Tochlu Mimenu Na" explicitly forbids Na - what is the Lav forbidding roasted [during the day]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Ochlu Es ha'Basar <i>ba'Laylah</i> ha'Zeh" - not during the day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is a Lav inferred from an Ase, which is like an Ase!</p></div>
