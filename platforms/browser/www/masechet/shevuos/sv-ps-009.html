<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>R. YISHMAEL'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yishmael, we cannot say that the outer goat atones for a Chet that was not known at the beginning and was known at the end, for he obligates a Korban in such a case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What does the outer goat atone for?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It atone for one who did not know at the beginning, nor at the end.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The goats of Rosh Chodesh and the Mo'adim atone for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yishmael holds like R. Meir, who says that the goats of Rosh Chodesh, the Mo'adim and the outer goat all atone for the same thing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was it necessary for the Torah to equate the outer goat to the inner goat?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that just like the inner goat atones only for Chata'im of Tum'ah of the Mikdash and Kodshim, also the outer goat.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE GOATS OFFERED ON MO'ADIM AND ROSH CHODESH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> The goats of the Mo'adim and Rosh Chodesh atone for Tum'ah that was never known.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah):</span> How does R. Yehudah learn this (Rashi; Tosfos - that they atone for Tum'ah of the Mikdash and Kodshim)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (part 1 - Rav Yehudah):</span> He learns (the goat of Rosh Chodesh) from "u'Se'ir Izim Echad l'Chatas la'Shem." This refers to Chata'im that only Hash-m knows about.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That verse is needed for Reish Lakish's teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> In the Chatas of Rosh Chodesh it says "la'Shem" to hint that Hash-m commanded us to bring an atonement for diminishing the moon. (Hash-m needs no atonement. He merely teaches that one who must censure someone should appease them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it came only for Reish Lakish's teaching, it should have said 'Al Hashem';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"La'Shem" teaches like Rav Yehudah expounded.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it teaches only like Rav Yehudah, and not Reish Lakish's teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said 'Chatas Hashem';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Chatas La'Shem" teaches both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The goat of Rosh Chodesh should atone for all Chata'im (that only Hash-m knows about)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> The goat of Rosh Chodesh comes at fixed times, just like the outer goat (of Yom Kipur);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the outer goat atones only for Tum'ah of the Mikdash and Kodshim, also the goat of Rosh Chodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have answered only for the goat of Rosh Chodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the source that goats of the Mo'adim atone for Tum'ah of the Mikdash and Kodshim, even though these are Chata'im of Kares?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael's teaching applies also to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from the goat of Rosh Chodesh, for the Mo'adim come less regularly;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We cannot learn from the outer goat, for the atonement of Yom Kipur is greater (it is for all Chata'im).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned Rosh Chodesh from the outer goat, without objecting that Rosh Chodesh comes more regularly (and therefore, perhaps it atones for more)!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah explicitly writes that the goat of Rosh Chodesh atones. The outer goat teaches only to limit the atonement of the goat of Rosh Chodesh</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Here, we seek a source that the goats of the Mo'adim atone. We cannot learn from something that atones more.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (part 2):</span> We learn like R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> It says about the goats of the Mo'adim "<i>u</i>'Se'ir." The extra 'Vov' equates it to the previous matter (the goat of Rosh Chodesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like the goat of Rosh Chodesh atones (for Tum'ah of the Mikdash and Kodshim) when he did not know at the beginning nor at the end, also the goats of the Mo'adim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one has no knowledge of his Chet, but others know and (presumably) will tell him, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does R. Yehudah consider this a Chet that is known at the end, and the outer goat atones for it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is it considered a Chet known only to Hash-m, and the goats of Rosh Chodesh and the Mo'adim atone for it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> The goats of Rosh Chodesh and the Mo'adim atone for a Chet that is not known at the beginning nor at the end, or that others know about and will tell him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>R. SHIMON'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> The goats of the Mo'adim atone for Tum'ah (of the Mikdash and Kodshim) that was never known, but those of Rosh Chodesh do not. (The goats of Rosh Chodesh atone for a Tahor person who ate Tamei Kodshim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> R. Shimon learns from a Gezeirah Shavah "Avon-Avon";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says about the goat of Rosh Chodesh (when the Mishkan was inaugurated) "Laseis Es Avon ha'Edah", and regarding the Tzitz (the plate on the Kohen Gadol's forehead) it says "Avon"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Tzitz makes acceptable a Korban whose meat (regarding an Olah, in which the meat is offered on the Altar) or blood or Chelev became Tamei. Similarly, the goat of Rosh Chodesh atones for (one who ate) Tamei Kodesh meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tzitz makes acceptable Tamei Kodshim brought on the Altar. We should learn that the goat of Rosh Chodesh does the same (R. Shmuel - that it atones for one who brought Tamei Kodshim on the Altar)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says about the goat "Avon ha'Edah" (a sin that only applies to people (R. Shmuel - to Yisraelim)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since we learn each from the other through a Gezeirah Shavah, we should say that the goat effects its atonement, and also makes acceptable like the Tzitz!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Normally, there is no need for something else to make the Korban acceptable, but) this would makes a difference if the Tzitz was broken!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> "Avon (singular)" - the goat only bears one sin, and not two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should say that the Tzitz makes acceptable, and also atones like the goat of Rosh Chodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This would give immediate atonement for a Tahor person who ate Tamei meat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> It says about the goat "Osah (it)" - only the goat bears this sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (to both suggestions - Rav Ashi):</span> It says about the goat "Avon ha'Edah", but not the sin of Kodshim (that were offered in Tum'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says about the Tzitz "Avon ha'Kodshim", but not the sin of Yisraelim.</p>
