<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE EFFECTS OF SEPARATING A KORBAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Sometimes, Eifa's answer is correct, for example in Rabah's case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 -Rashi - (Rabah):</span> If one said 'I swear that I will not eat figs and grapes (on the same day), I swear that I will not eat figs', and he (forgot the oaths and) ate figs, (realized his mistake,) separated a Korban (for the latter oath, forgot the first oath and) ate grapes, he is not liable for the first oath. Since separating the Korban disassociates eating the figs from eating the grapes, we consider that he violated only half of the first oath, so he does not bring a Korban for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - (Rabah):</span> If one said 'I swear that I will not eat figs, I swear that I will not eat figs and grapes (together; even though he already swore not to eat figs, since he creates a new Isur on grapes, the oath takes effect)', and he (forgot the oaths and) ate figs, (realized his mistake,) separated a Korban and (forgot his oath and) ate grapes, he is not liable for the second oath. Since separating the Korban disassociates eating the figs from eating the grapes, we consider that he violated only half of the second oath, he does not bring a Korban for it. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Here also, if he swore 'I will not eat ten figs, I will not eat nine figs', he ate nine, separated a Korban and ate a tenth, separating the Korban disassociates the nine figs from the tenth, so he is not liable for the first oath.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>VAIN OATHS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are vain oaths:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An oath that contradicts what people know to be true, e.g. 'this pillar (which all can see is stone) is gold', or 'this is a woman (all can see it is a man)', or vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He swore about something impossible, e.g. 'if I did not see a camel fly in the air, or a snake like the beam of an olivepress';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Witnesses were asked to testify, and they swore that they will not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One swore not to fulfill a Mitzvah, e.g. not to dwell in a Sukah, take a Lulav or don Tefilin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>These are vain oaths. One who b'Mezid swears in vain is lashed. If he did so b'Shogeg, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one said 'I swear that I will eat this loaf, I swear that I will <i>not</i> eat it', the first is Shevu'as Bituy, and the latter is a vain oath;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he eats the loaf, he transgressed swearing in vain. If he does not eat it, he transgressed (even) Bituy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Ula):</span> Something is considered known to people if three people know it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He swore about something impossible, e.g.'if I did not see a camel fly.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> 'I saw a camel fly' is a vain oath.  However, he did not say that, rather, '<i>if</i> I did <i>not</i> see a camel fly.' This is not an oath!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Indeed, the Mishnah should say 'I saw a camel fly.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> This is part of the previous case, he swore (to do something impossible, e.g.) 'all food is forbidden to me (through a Shevu'ah) if I did not see a camel fly.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SWEARING BASED ON ONE'S OWN INTENTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Perhaps the man saw a huge bird, nicknamed it 'camel' and swore truthfully based on his Da'as (intent of his words)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We judge oaths (objectively) based on the words he said, and not based on his personal intent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Beraisa):</span> When Beis Din administers an oath, we tell the one who must swear 'you do not swear based on your own Da'as, rather based on the Da'as (understanding) of Hash-m and Beis Din.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If Beis Din did not say this, he could swear based on his Da'as, e.g. he could nickname some wood chips 'money', and swear 'I gave the money to Ploni'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. (Really, we judge oaths objectively based on his words, and not based on his Da'as);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are concerned for cases like what occurred in front of Rava. (A man hid money in a stick, asked his creditor to hold the stick, and swore 'I gave you your money'! This was literally true, but it was unlike Beis Din's understanding.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Beraisa):</span> When Moshe forced Bnei Yisrael to swear, he said 'I do not make you swear based on your Da'as, rather based on Hash-m's Da'as and mine.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He could not simply ask them to swear to fulfill what Eloka (G-d) said, lest they swear based on their own intention, e.g. they would call an idol 'Elo'ah' and swear by it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, that would be based on the objective meaning of the words. Idols are called Elo'ah - "Elohei Kesef."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he make them swear to observe the Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They could say 'we swore to observe only one Torah (written or oral).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Likewise, had he made them swear to observe two Toros, they could say 'we swore only to observe the Toros (laws of) Chatas and Olah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Had he made them swear to observe the entire Torah, this could be construed to mean idolatry, which is equivalent to the entire Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Had he made them swear to observe Mitzvah, this would only mean one Mitzvah. 'Mitzvos' would mean only two Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Had he made them swear to observe all the Mitzvos, this could be construed to mean Tzitzis, which is equivalent to the entire Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he make them swear to observe 613 Mitzvos?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Why did he have to make them swear based on Hash-m's <i>and</i> Moshe's Da'as? It would have sufficed to swear based on Moshe's Da'as'!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> This is in order that the oath (will be based on the Da'as of many (others), so it) cannot be annulled.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OTHER VAIN OATHS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...'If I did not see a snake like the beam of an olivepress'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A bigger snake was seen in the days of Shevor Malka. It consumed 13 stables (or bundles) of hay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> He means, it was Taruf (Rashi - grooved) like the beam of an olivepress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> All snakes are like that!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, its back was Taruf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I swear that I will eat this loaf, I swear that I will <i>not</i> eat it... '(if he does not eat it, he transgressed Bituy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he liable only for Bituy, and not for (the latter,) a vain oath?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Indeed, the Mishnah means, he transgressed <i>even</i> Bituy.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>IMPOSING AN OATH ON ANOTHER PERSON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Oaths of Bituy apply to men and women, (whether he swore to help) relatives and strangers, people qualified and unqualified to testify, in and outside of Beis Din, when he swears himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is lashed if he transgressed b'Mezid, and brings an Oleh v'Yored if he was Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Vain oaths apply to men and women, (whether he swore about) relatives and strangers, people qualified and unqualified to testify, in and outside of Beis Din, when he swears himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is lashed if he transgressed b'Mezid. If he was Shogeg, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Another person can put either oath on him. If Reuven said 'I did not eat (or don Tefilin) today', and Shimon said 'I impose this on you through a Shevu'ah', and Reuven answered 'Amen', he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> One who answers 'Amen' to an oath is like one who said the oath himself - "v'Amrah ha'Ishah Amen Amen" (if the Sotah is guilty, she will die for this oath).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (Rav Papa):</span> Shmuel must be correct. This is the only way to resolve a contradiction between a Mishnah and Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Shevu'as ha'Edus (the oath of not knowing testimony) applies only to men, only to strangers, only to Kosher witnesses, only to people proper to testify (this excludes kings), in or outside of Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When he swears himself, he is liable anywhere. If the oath is imposed on him, he is liable only if he denies in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Shevu'as ha'Edus is when Reuven asked witnesses to testify for him; and they said 'we swear that we do not know testimony for you';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or:, they said 'we do not know testimony for you', and Reuven said 'I impose this on you through an oath', and they answered 'Amen', whether in or outside of Beis Din, whether they swore themselves or the oath was imposed on them, they are liable if they deny in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> When they answer 'Amen', they are liable even outside of Beis Din. If they (accepted the oath but) did not say 'Amen', they are liable only in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Ravina):</span> We can resolve a contradiction in our Mishnah only like Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Oaths of Bituy apply... when he swears himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It does not apply when the oath was imposed on him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Seifa):</span> Another person can put either oath on him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> When they answer 'Amen', they are liable even outside of Beis Din. If they (accepted the oath but) did not say 'Amen', they are liable only in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Shmuel's Chidush? The Mishnah teaches this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel teaches that the Mishnah teaches this law.</p>
