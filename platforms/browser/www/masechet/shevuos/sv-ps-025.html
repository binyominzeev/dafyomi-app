<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MULTIPLE TRANSGRESSIONS FOR ONE EATING (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Ravina):</span> The Tana lists only transgressions that apply to food, oaths apply to other things as well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Hekdesh applies to sticks and stones!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the Tana only lists transgressions that only apply to tangible things;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Oaths apply to intangible things, e.g. I will sleep (or not sleep).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE TYPES OF SHEVU'AS BITUY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Oaths of Bituy apply to one's own things, and to other people's; they apply to tangible and intangible things. The following are oaths of Bituy;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He swore 'I will give (or not give) to Ploni', 'I gave (or did not give) to Ploni', 'I will (or will not) sleep', 'I slept (or did not sleep)', 'I will (or will not) throw a rock into the sea', 'I threw (or did not throw) a rock into the sea.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yishmael says, one is liable (a Korban) only for oaths regarding the future - "Lehara Oh Leheitiv."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> If so, he should be liable only for doing good or evil. What is the source to include neutral things (e.g. throwing a rock into the sea)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> The Torah includes this ("l'Chol Asher Yivatei").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> This includes also oaths about the past!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> In some ways, Nedarim are more stringent than Shevu'os. In some ways, Shevu'os are more stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A stringency of Nedarim over Shevu'os is that Nedarim take effect on Mitzvos, just like on optional matters, but Shevu'os do not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A stringency of Shevu'os over Nedarim is that Shevu'os take effect on intangible things just like on tangible things, but Nedarim do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven swore 'I will give (or not give) to Ploni... '</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to giving Tzedakah to a poor person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The oath (that Yisrael accepted on Sinai) already obligates him -  "Nason Titen Lo" (so his oath does not takes effect)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, it refers to a gift to a rich person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> 'I will (or will not) sleep.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that if one swears 'I will not sleep for three days', we lash him (for a Shav oath) and he may sleep immediately!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when he specified three days. Here, he did not specify (Rashba - he intends, 'I will not sleep until I must') R. Chananel, Rosh - he specified one or two days).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MUST THE OATH APPLY TO THE FUTURE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> 'I will (or will not) throw a rock into the sea.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one said 'I swear that Ploni threw (or did not throw) a rock into the sea', he is liable (for an oath of Bituy if this is false);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav obligates. Since the oath applies in the positive and negative, it is Bituy;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel exempts. Since it does not apply to the future, it is not Bituy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue like the following Tana'im argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> One is liable for oaths of Bituy only for the future;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> If so, he should be liable only for doing good or evil. What is the source to include neutral things (e.g. throwing a rock into the sea)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> The Torah includes this ("l'Chol Asher Yivatei").</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> This includes also oaths about the past!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav holds like R. Akiva, and Shmuel holds like R. Yishmael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Indeed, we must say that Rav holds like R. Akiva;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael cannot agree to Rav's law, for R. Yishmael exempts (all) oaths of the past, even those that could apply to the future, and all the more oaths that could not apply to the future!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, R. Akiva could agree to Shmuel's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We know that R. Akiva obligates only for oaths of the past that could apply to the future. Perhaps he exempts for oaths that could not apply to the future!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav and Shmuel argue like the following Tana'im do.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one swore not to fulfill a Mitzvah and he fulfilled it, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he swore to fulfill a Mitzvah and did not fulfill it, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One might have thought to obligate, like R. Yehudah ben Beseira.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira says, if one is liable for (transgressing) an oath about Reshus (something optional), which he is not forced to do due to the oath of Sinai, and all the more so for an oath to fulfill a Mitzvah, which he is must fulfill due to the oath of Sinai!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No. He is liable for an oath about Reshus, because such an oath could be made in the positive or negative;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>He is exempt for an oath to fulfill a Mitzvah, because such an oath can be made only in the positive, but not in the negative!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rav holds like R. Yehudah ben Beseira, and Shmuel holds like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Indeed, we must say that Shmuel holds like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira obligates an oath even if it does not apply to the negative, and all the more so if (it applies to the negative but) not to the future!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, Chachamim could agree to Rav's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim say that one is liable only for an oath that could be made in the positive or negative, like we explicitly learn from "Lehara Oh Leheitiv";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Perhaps they do not require that it can be in the past or future, since this is not explicit in the Torah. We learn Shevu'as Bituy in the past only through expounding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Rav Hamnuna - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said 'I did not eat today', or 'I did not don Tefilin today', and Shimon said 'I impose an oath on you', and Reuven answered 'Amen', he is liable (if he lied).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, he is liable for 'I did not eat', for he could swear for the future (I will eat);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, why is he liable for 'I did not don Tefilin'? He could not swear 'I will not don Tefilin', for the oath of Sinai obligates him to don Tefilin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Hamnuna):</span> There are different liabilities for the two oaths;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For 'I did not eat', he is (even) liable to bring a Korban (if he did not know the punishment for swearing falsely);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For 'I did not don Tefilin', he is lashed (if he was warned not to swear falsely and did so b'Mezid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Rava - Mishnah):</span> Shevu'as Shav is swearing to negate what people know to be true, e.g. about a stone pillar that it is of gold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> He is liable only if three people know that this is false.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If people do not know, this is Bituy, even though it does not apply to the future (to say 'it will be of gold')!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> (Ula means that) if people know, the oath is Shav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If people do not know, this is a false oath (but he is not liable for Bituy).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SWEARING ABOUT KNOWING TESTIMONY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Rav admits that if one swore falsely 'I know testimony for you', he is exempt, because the negative version of this (I do not know testimony for you) is not Bituy, rather Shevu'as ha'Edus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav and Shmuel argue about 'I knew testimony for you' and 'I did not know testimony for you' (in situations where the testimony is no longer needed), and about 'I testified for you' and 'I did not testify for you.' (Rav obligates, and Shmuel exempts. These oaths apply to the positive and negative, but not to the future. It is not in his control to know testimony or not, and if he knows, he is commanded to testify.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>According to Shmuel, 'I do not know testimony for you' is not Bituy, since it does not apply to the future. This is why the Torah had to write the Parshah of Shevu'as ha'Edus, to obligate a Korban for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav, it is Bituy even though it does not apply to the future. Why did the Torah need to write the Parshah of Shevu'as ha'Edus to obligate a Korban?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabanan):</span> This obligates him a second Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> "L'Achas me'Eleh" - he brings only one Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Abaye answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> Regarding the other transgressions for which one brings an Oleh v'Yored, it says 'v'Ne'elam', but not regarding Shevu'as ha'Edus. This teaches that one brings a Korban for Shevu'as ha'Edus even if he was Mezid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rabanan):</span> Perhaps he brings one Korban if he sinned b'Mezid, and two if he sinned b'Shogeg!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> I already taught "l'Achas me'Eleh" - he brings only one Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches when he sinned b'Shogeg. If he was Mezid, he cannot bring a Korban for Bituy, and no verse is needed to exclude bringing two Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "L'Achas me'Eleh" is not needed for Shevu'as ha'Edus. (Rather, it teaches about one who swore not to eat and ate three types of food);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Whenever the Torah gives new laws to a particular case that was part of a general rule (e.g. 'I do not know testimony for you', which was a Shevu'ah of Bituy, was given the name and special laws of Shevu'as ha'Edus), the laws of the general rule no longer apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Abaye holds that it is also considered Bituy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Abaye said that Rav admits that 'I know testimony for you' is exempt (from Bituy) because 'I do not know testimony for you' is not Bituy!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Abaye retracted from saying that Rav admits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> One of these two teachings was actually said by Rav Papa (and mistakenly attributed to Abaye).</p>
