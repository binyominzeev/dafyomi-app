<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES HEKDESH BUY ON CONDITION?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is Chachamim (Daf 10b) who permit redeeming the extra Ketores and giving it to the workers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Ketores never gets a Mum, therefore they must stipulate, so it may be redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We have no source that they stipulate to permit redeeming a Tam animal. We could wait until it gets a Mum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is Chachamim (11b) who permit redeeming a Tam red heifer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps only there they stipulate, because it is very expensive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> It is Rabanan who asked R. Shimon why he permits using goats of Rosh Chodesh for Yom Kipur. (They permit because Hekdesh buys on condition.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Granted, if Rabanan hold like R. Yehudah (that the goats atone for different things), they must hold that Hekdesh buys on condition;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, perhaps Rabanan hold like R. Meir, that all the goats atone for the same thing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> R. Yochanan had a tradition that Chachamim say that Hekdesh buys on condition, and (Tosfos - he derived from our Mishnah) that R. Shimon argues.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT WE DO WITH THE EXTRA KORBANOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Shimon, what do we do with the extra lambs for the Tamid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> They are brought for Nedavah (Olos when the Altar is idle).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> R. Shimon admits that extra Chatas goats of the Tzibur are not themselves brought for Nedavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, they are left to graze until they get a Mum. They are redeemed, and the money goes to Nedavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon permits using the same animal only when it was originally an Olah as well (e.g. the Tamid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>However, if it was originally a Chatas, the same animal is not offered for Nedavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is a decree, lest it be brought before the replacement for the Chatas is offered (and then it is still a Chatas, and it is not a valid Olah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (Abaye - Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If the (inner) bull or goat of Yom Kipur was lost, and another was taken in its place and the lost animal was found, we leave it to die;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same applies to goats brought for (a mistaken ruling about) idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar and R. Shimon say, it is left to graze (until it gets a Mum; it is redeemed) and the money goes to Nedavah, because Chatas ha'Tzibur is never left to die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't the found animal itself be offered?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a decree, lest it be brought before the replacement is offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If (after the lottery to determine which goat is offered to Hash-m and which is sent, one of them dies, we take two other goats and do another lottery;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One new goat will replace the dead goat; the other grazes until it gets a Mum, the money goes to Nedavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't the goat itself be offered?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a decree, lest it be brought before the original goat is offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support #3 (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven separated a Korban Asham, and he died, or he lost it and offered a different animal and then found the first one, the (unneeded) Asham grazes until it gets a Mum, and the money goes to Nedavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer says, we leave the Asham to die;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, Reuven (or his heir, if he died) uses its money to buy an Olah and brings it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't the animal itself be offered for an Olah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a decree, lest it be brought before the replacement is offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Extra (Chatas) offerings that are not needed are brought for Kitz ha'Mizbe'ach, like Benos Shu'ach (a type of fig).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Chol Devash Lo Saktiru... la'Shem" (we may not offer fruit on the Altar)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chanina):</span> The Beraisa means, it is <i>like</i> figs for a person (i.e. a dessert).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> We do not offer birds for Kitz ha'Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> This is wrong!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> What is wrong with it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Simi of Neharde'a):</span> Extra Korbanos are used for Nedavah of the Tzibur. The Tzibur does not bring birds for Olos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Shmuel holds like R. Yochanan (that R. Shimon holds that extra lambs designated for the Tamid are brought for Olos Nedavah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Communal Korbanos may be slaughtered for something slightly different than their original designation, as long as it is similar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> R. Shimon admits that if a goat of the Mo'ed was not offered on the Mo'ed, it may be offered on Rosh Chodesh. If it was not offered on Rosh Chodesh, it may be offered on Yom Kipur, and if not then, on the next Mo'ed, and if not, on the following Mo'ed, for it was originally designated to be brought on the outer Altar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Version #2 (Tosfos) Shmuel holds like R. Yochanan (that Chachamim hold that Hekdesh purchases on condition, extra Tamid Korbanos can be redeemed Tam).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Korbanos Tzibur may be changed from their original designation until they are slaughtered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Shimon admits that if a goat of the Mo'ed was not offered on the Mo'ed, it may be offered on Rosh Chodesh, and if not, on Yom Kipur, and if not, on the next Mo'ed, and if not, on the following Mo'ed, for it was originally designated to be brought on the outer Altar. (Some explain that this is a support for Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak, who says that R. Shimon admits that extra Chata'os Tzibur are not themselves brought for Nedavah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ATONEMENT FOR OTHER TRANSGRESSIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The inner goat and Yom Kipur atone for intentional Tum'ah in the Mikdash or with Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "V'Chiper Al ha'Kodesh mi'Tum'os Bnei Yisrael...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Umi'Pisheihem" refers to intentional sins. "Chatosom" refers to unintentional sins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The goat sent to Azazel atones for all other transgressions, light or severe, intentional or unintentional, (whether or not the person knows he sinned, Lav or Aseh, even what is punishable by Kares or death)...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah teaches the same things in different ways!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A light sin is a Lav or Aseh. A severe sin is one punishable by Kares or death!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Intentional is when he knows that he sinned. Unintentional is when he does not know!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah teaches as follows. The goat sent to Azazel atones for all other transgressions, light or severe, intentional or unintentional;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The unintentional sins are whether or not the person found out that <i>perhaps</i> he sinned (e.g. one of two pieces of meat was Chelev, and he is unsure which he ate. Normally, the doubt obligates him to bring an Asham.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A light sin is a Lav or Aseh. A severe sin is one punishable by Kares or death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of an Aseh?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did not repent, Korbanos do not atone for him - "Zevach Resha'im To'evah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he repented, he got atonement immediately!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one transgressed an Aseh and repented, he is forgiven immediately.</p>
