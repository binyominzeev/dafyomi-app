<p class="dedicationbox">SHEVUOS 39 (19 Teves) - Dedicated in memory of Hagaon Rav Yisrael Avraham Abba ben Harav Chaim Binyamin Ze'ev Krieger ZT"L, author of Yad Yisrael (on Rambam) and many other Sefarim. Dedicated by his granddaughter and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. Avi and Lily Berger. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE PUNISHMENT FOR FALSE OATHS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even Shevu'as ha'Dayanim may be said in any language that the defendant understands;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We tell him that the world shook when Hash-m said on Sinai "Lo Sisa Es Shem Hash-m la'Shav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Regarding all other transgressions, it says "v'Nakeh". Regarding swearing falsely, it says "Lo Yenake";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Regarding all other transgressions, Hash-m punishes (only) the sinner. Regarding swearing falsely, He punishes his family as well - "Al Titen Es Picha Lachati Es Besarecha";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Besarecha" refers to his family.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Regarding all other transgressions, Hash-m punishes the sinner. Regarding swearing falsely, He punishes the entire world - "Alo v'Chachesh... (Al Ken Te'eval ha'Aretz v'Umlal Kol Yoshev Bah." The Gra deletes the following suggestion and rejection from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that is only for doing all the transgressions in that verse!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Mipnei Alah Avlah ha'Aretz."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Regarding all other transgressions, if he has merits, his punishment is suspended for two or three generations. For swearing falsely, he is punished immediately - "Hotzeisi'ah... u'Ba'ah El Beis ha'Ganav v'El Beis ha'Nishba bi'Shmi la'Shaker v'Laneh b'Soch Beiso v'Chilato v'Es Etzav v'Es Avanav";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Hotzeisi'ah (I took out a scroll of punishments awaiting the following people)" - immediately. "U'Ba'ah El Beis ha'Ganav" is one who is Gonev Da'as (deceives). He falsely claims money in order to force people to swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"V'El Beis ha'Nishba bi'Shmi la'Shaker" is one who swears falsely. "... V'Chilato v'Es Etzav v'Es Avanav" - water and fire do not wear away the wood and rocks (of his house), but false oaths do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If the defendant says 'I will (pay and) not swear', we immediately make him leave Beis Din, so he cannot retract (Rashi; R. Tam - so he will be ashamed to retract later)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If he says 'I will swear', all present say "Suru Na me'Al Ohalei ha'Anashim ha'Rsha'im ha'Eleh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When we administer the oath, we tell him 'you do not swear according to your own Da'as (intent), rather, according to Da'as Hash-m and of Beis Din.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We find that Moshe forced Bnei Yisrael to swear this way. He said 'I do not make you swear according to your Da'as, rather according to Hash-m's Da'as and my Da'as - "v'Lo Itechem Levadechem";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Asher Yeshno Po ha'Yom" refers to those who stood on Har Sinai. "Asher Einenu Po Imanu ha'Yom" refers to future generations and those who will convert later;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>This applies to Mitzvos received on Har Sinai (i.e. mid'Oraisa). We learn Mitzvos (mid'Rabanan) that will be given later, such as reading Megilas Esther, from "Kiymu v'Kibelu" - they fulfilled what they already accepted (i.e. whatever Mitzvos Chachamim will enact). (end of Beraisa)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said '<i>even</i> Shevu'as ha'Dayanim may be said in any language.' What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like the other things listed in the following Mishnah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following may be said in any language: the Parshah of Sotah (giving her to drink), the declaration of (having properly given) Ma'aseros, Kri'as Shema, prayer, Birkas ha'Mazon, Shevu'as ha'Edus, and Shevu'as ha'Pikadon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Beraisa teaches that also Shevu'as ha'Dayanim may be said in any language.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We tell him that the world shook when Hash-m said on Sinai "Lo Sisa Es Shem Hash-m la'Shav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is because it was said on Sinai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> All ten utterances were said on Sinai!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it is because it is stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa):</span> Light transgressions are a Mitzvas Aseh or Lav, except for "Lo Sisa." Severe transgressions are those punishable by Kares or Misah (through Beis Din), and "Lo Sisa." (This shows that it is no more stringent than transgressions of Kares or Misah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (continuation of the Beraisa):</span> Regarding all other transgressions, it says "v'Nakeh." Regarding swearing falsely, it says "Lo Yenake."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Lo Yenake" is written regarding all transgressions (after the 13 Midos of Hash-m)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is (if he did not repent), like R. Elazar taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar) Question:</span> How can it say both "Lo Yenake" and "Yenakeh"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m cleanses one who repents, but not one who does not repent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Regarding false oaths, Hash-m does not cleanse (without punishments) even if he repents.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO IS PUNISHED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Regarding all other transgressions, Hash-m punishes the sinner. Regarding swearing falsely, He punishes also his family.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are other transgressions for which Hash-m also punishes his family (such as giving children over to Molech) - "v'Samti Ani Es Panai ba'Ish ha'Hu uv'Mishpachto"!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon) Question:</span> Why is his family punished for his sin?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon):</span> If there is a tax collector (who takes more than is proper) or robber in a family, they are all guilty of theft, for they cover up for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding other transgressions, the family is not punished as harshly as the sinner (even if they could have protested). Regarding false oaths, the family gets the same punishment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi) Suggestion:</span> Since it says "v'Samti Ani Es Panai... (uv'Mishpachto)", perhaps the entire family gets Kares!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hichrati <i>Oso</i>" - only the one who handed over his children to Molech gets Kares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Regarding all other transgressions, Hash-m punishes the sinner. Regarding swearing falsely, He punishes the entire world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also for other transgressions, Hash-m punishes the entire world!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Chashlu Ish b'Achiv" - a man will stumble (be punished for) the sin of his brother. This teaches that every Yisrael is responsible for every Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only if they could have protested, but did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between Resha'im (those who could have protested, but did not) of his family and evil strangers, and between Tzadikim (those who could not have protested) of his family and righteous strangers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding all other transgressions, the sinner gets his punishment, Resha'im of his family get a (lighter but) severe punishment, evil strangers get a light punishment, and Tzadikim are not punished at all;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding false oaths, the sinner and Resha'im of his family get the same punishment, evil strangers get a severe punishment, and Tzadikim are punished lightly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the defendant says 'I will (pay and) not swear', we immediately make him leave Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he says 'I will swear', all present say "Suru Na me'Al Ohalei ha'Anashim ha'Rsha'im ha'Eleh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that both are evil. Only one will (possibly) swear falsely!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Tarfon):</span> "Shevu'as Hash-m Tihyeh Bein Shneihem" - they are both punished for the oath (one who deposits with a swindler helps cause desecration of Hash-m's name).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When we administer the oath, we tell him 'you do not swear according to your own Da'as, rather according to that of Hash-m and Beis Din.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must we say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned for cases like the oath in front of Rava. (A man hid money in a stick, asked his creditor to hold the stick, and swore 'I gave you your money.' This was literally true, but not according to Beis Din's understanding.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE ADMISSION AND DENIAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The claim must be at least two (Ma'os of) Kesef (and the admission is a Perutah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This means that the defendant must <i>deny</i> a claim of two Ma'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The entire claim must be at least two Ma'os. It suffices that he denies at least a Perutah and admits to at least a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Our Mishnah supports Rav, but the verses support Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>According to Rav, the Mishnah is fine. It teaches the amount of denial (two Ma'os) and admission (a Perutah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Shmuel, it omits teaching the amount of denial (a Perutah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The verses support Shmuel as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ki Yiten... Kesef Oh Kelim" - just like Kelim (plural) implies two, also Kesef;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like Kesef is important, also (a claim of) any (two) important things (our text, Rashi; Tosfos - of important Kelim, i.e. each is worth at least a Perutah) can obligate an oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"(He will say) Ki Hu Zeh" - (the defendant says) 'of your entire claim (of two Ma'os) this is all I owe!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Defense of Rav:</span> This teaches that he must partially admit to the claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel holds that since "Ki" and "Zeh" are both extra, we learn both (the oath comes for such a claim, and that he must partially admit to the claim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav learns that (1) he must partially admit to the claim, and (2) the admission must be like the claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav):</span> If he partially admits to a claim of two Ma'os, he must deny less than two Ma'os!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse teaches that the denial must be at least two Ma'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> If not, it should have said only "Kelim". We would have known that also Kesef must be two;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Kesef" is extra to teach that the denial itself must be two Ma'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Shmuel):</span> Had it said only "Kelim", we would have thought that a claim of any two things suffices, even if they are not important;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Kesef" is needed to teach that they must be important.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven claimed two Ma'os of Kesef, and Shimon admitted that he owes a Perutah, Shimon is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He is exempt because the denial is less than two Ma'os!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. The claim was not the <i>value</i> of two Ma'os, rather, two Ma'os specifically of silver (e.g. a deposit or theft);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is exempt because the admission was (a Perutah, a copper coin, which is) not like what was claimed (silver coins).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven claimed two Ma'os of Kesef and a Perutah, and Shimon admitted that he owes a Perutah, he must (pay the Perutah and) swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand if the claim was the <i>value</i> of two Ma'os and a Perutah, for then the admission and denial are similar (both are value);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if the claim was specifically two silver Ma'os and a Perutah, the admission (a Perutah) is unlike the denial (silver Ma'os)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is not difficult for Shmuel. Rav Nachman cited Shmuel to say that if two different things are claimed and he admits to one of them, he must swear!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Shmuel - Seifa):</span> If Reuven claimed a liter of gold, and Shimon admitted that he owes a liter of silver, Shimon is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand why he is exempt if the claim was specifically a liter of gold. If so, the admission was unlike the claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if the claim was the value of a liter of gold, he admitted to part of the claim (and also denied more than two Ma'os)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Just like the Seifa must refer to the metal itself (not the value), also the beginning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes Rav! (The Mishnah implies that if the denial was like the claim, he would be liable to swear, even though the denial is less than two Ma'os.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav explains that almost the entire Mishnah refers to claims of value;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The only exception is a liter of gold. (Because it is not a currency, people do not normally use it for a unit of value.)</p>
