<p class="dedicationbox">SHEVUOS 48 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WITNESSES WHO CONTRADICT EACH OTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna bar Yehudah - Beraisa):</span> Two witnesses saw the new moon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If to one it appeared two plowshares above the horizon, and to the other, three plowshares, we accept their testimony (we attribute the difference to inaccuracy, the testimonies concur);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If to one it appeared three plowshares above, and to the other, five, we reject their testimony (we do not attribute the difference to inaccuracy. this is contradictory testimony);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The witnesses can join for other testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that either witness can testify with someone else in a monetary case (he is a valid witness, like Rav Huna and unlike Rav Chisda)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Beraisa means that if someone else agrees with one of them about the moon, they join and we accept their testimony to sanctify the new month;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We ignore the other witness, for two witnesses disagree with him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SWEARING ABOUT WHETHER MONEY WAS GIVEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven asked Shimon (a grocer) for a Dinar's worth of Peros... (Reuven swears that he paid a Dinar, and keeps the Peros.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> This is when the Peros are in front of them and they are fighting over them, but if Reuven put them in his bag and slung them over his shoulder, Shimon can only take them if he brings a proof. (If he does not, Reuven need not swear.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven asked Shimon (a moneychanger) for a Dinar's worth of smaller coins... (Reuven swears that he gave to him and keeps the coins.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We needed to teach both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had we taught only about a grocer, one might have thought that Chachamim believe a grocer (when the buyer holds the Peros), because fruit rots (so he gives the Peros before receiving the money, lest the buyer retract), but they admit about a moneychanger;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had we taught only about a moneychanger, one might have thought that R. Yehudah holds that a moneychanger is never believed, for he never gives change before receiving the money, but he admits about a grocer (because fruit rots, like we said above).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>INHERITING MONEY WHICH CAN BE COLLECTED WITH AN OATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Just like a woman who wants to collect the rest of a Kesuvah that was already partially paid... must swear, also orphans must swear to collect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From whom do they (need to swear in order to) collect?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is from (Shimon,) the one who borrowed from their father (Reuven).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Reuven could have collected without swearing. Why must his orphans swear?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they must swear in order to collect from Shimon's orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> This is only if Reuven died before Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if Shimon died first, Reuven could not have collected from the orphans without swearing that he was not paid;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One does not inherit (a claim to) money that his father could collect only through swearing. (Rashi - since the orphans do not know whether the loan was paid, they cannot swear.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't it suffice for them to take the oath of orphans ('our father did not tell us that this document was paid, nor did we find a receipt saying that the document was paid')?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> Indeed, they can swear this way and collect! (He argues with Rav and Shmuel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Ami):</span> If Reuven tried collecting in Beis Din from Shimon's orphans, and Beis Din ruled that he must swear first, and he died before swearing, his heirs do not inherit the right to collect through swearing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven never tried to collect and he died, his heirs inherit the money owed to him. They take the oath of orphans and collect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> The law does not depend on whether or not he tried collecting in Beis Din. The moment Shimon died, the law is that Reuven can collect only if he swears!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Rather, if the Halachah follows Rav and Shmuel, they cannot collect even if Reuven never tried collecting. If the Halachah is not like Rav and Shmuel, they can collect even if Reuven tried collecting in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Nachman is unsure whether the Halachah follows Rav and Shmuel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, Rav Yosef bar Minyomi said that a case occurred, and Rav Nachman ruled that they collect half!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Nachman meant that if Rav and Shmuel's explanation of R. Meir is correct, we do not distinguish whether Reuven tried collecting;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nachman himself holds that the Halachah follows R. Yosi (45a).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>(The following questions are against Rav and Shmuel, for they show that heirs can inherit money that could have been collected only through swearing to orphans.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Oshaya - Mishnah):</span> If a widow died without collecting her Kesuvah, her heirs must express, within 25 years, their intent to collect it. (If they do not, this shows that they waived their right to collect from the other orphans.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she swore that she did not collect any part of her Kesuvah, but died before collecting it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Mishnah):</span> Reuven married Leah, and she died. He married Rachel, and he died. Rachel or (if she died) her heirs have precedence (to collect her Kesuvah) before Leah's sons collect (Kesuvas Benin Dichrin, the right to collect the dowry she brought into the marriage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, Rachel swore and died before collecting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Mishnah):</span> (Even if Reuven wrote in Leah's Kesuvah that he waives the right to make her or her heirs swear that she did not receive part of her Kesuvah, if Reuven died before it was collected, his heirs can demand an oath before paying her, her heirs, or anyone who acquired the rights to her Kesuvah. (Since his heirs can make her swear, the case is that she did not swear already!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shemayah):</span> The Mishnah puts together the laws of two different cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His heirs can make her swear whether she was widowed or divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They can make her heirs swear (the oath of orphans) if she was divorced (a divorcee need not swear to collect; but a widow must swear to collect, so her heirs do not inherit her Kesuvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question #4 (Rav Noson bar Hoshaya - Beraisa):</span> A son has greater ability to collect (debts owed to his father, after the father died) than his father:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sometimes a son collects through swearing, and sometimes he collects without swearing (this will be explained shortly);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A father collects only through swearing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The borrower died before the father (therefore, the father could collect only through swearing).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> A son collects without swearing, when his father told witnesses just before dying that he was not paid. This is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>All other times, he collects through swearing the oath of orphans (even though his father would have had to swear that he was not paid)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is Beis Shamai, who say that a document is considered to be paid. (Even though the father must swear to collect, it is as if he bequeaths money to his son.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE FINAL RULING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rav Chisda and Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> Let us overturn the ruling of Rav and Shmuel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman):</span> No, but let us ensure that judges (who rule like Rav and Shmuel) not extend the law to other cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What other cases might one have thought to extend it to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought to extend it to Rav Papa's case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If Reuven lent money with a document and partially collected the loan, even though Reuven must swear to collect the rest, his heirs inherit the (right to collect) the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If Shimon lent money to Levi, and Yehudah was an Arev, and Levi died, (even though Shimon must swear in order to collect from Yehudah,) Shimon's heirs inherit the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> No. Since Yehudah can collect what he pays from Levi's heirs, this is precisely the law of Rav and Shmuel (the heirs do not inherit it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> If Shimon lent money to Levi, and Levi died, then Shimon died, and his brother inherited him, we do not extend Rav and Shmuel's law to say that the brother cannot collect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> We do extend it. There is no difference between 'our father did not tell us... ' and 'our brother did not tell us... '</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chama):</span> Since the Halachah was not decided to be like Rav and Shmuel, nor like R. Elazar, whichever way a judge rules, the ruling stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If orphans have a loan document that they want to collect from the orphans of the borrower, we do not tear up the document, nor do we collect the debt for them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not collect the debt for them, for perhaps the Halachah follows Rav and Shmuel. (Because we are in doubt, it is better not to act);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We do not tear up the document, for perhaps they will find a judge who rules like R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>A judge ruled like R. Elazar. A Chacham told him 'I will bring a letter from Eretz Yisrael saying that the Halachah does not follow R. Elazar.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The judge:</span> Until you bring the letter, my ruling stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Chacham told this to Rav Chama.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chama:</span> Whichever way a judge rules, the ruling stands.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>SWEARING ABOUT AN UNCERTAIN CLAIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following swear even when there is no claim...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If there is no claim, there is no reason to swear!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means that the following swear even when the claim against them is uncertain: partners, sharecroppers...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When the Mishnah says 'a member of the household who goes in and out... ', this does not mean that he walks in and out. Rather, he conducts business with workers and Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the people listed swear even when there is no (definite) claim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because they toil, they think they are entitled to take (extra) compensation for themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef bar Minyomi):</span> They are obligated to swear only if there is a claim of (perhaps you took) at least two Ma'os (for then this resembles a mid'Oraisa oath).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Shmuel, who says that the claim must be at least two Ma'os;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, R. Chiya's teaching supports Rav (who says that the denial must be at least two Ma'os)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yosef means, there must be a denial of a claim of at least two Ma'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> After the partners split up (or the others desist their positions)...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a defendant must take a mid'Rabanan oath, can the claimant be Megalgel (force him to swear about other matters)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven borrowed from Shimon before Shemitah, and became his partner (or sharecropper) after Shemitah, Shimon (can make Reuven swear about the partnership, but he) cannot be Megalgel (force him to swear about the loan);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is because Shemitah cancels the loan. If not for this (e.g. if he borrowed after Shemitah), he could be Megalgel, even though the oath of partners is mid'Rabanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the inference is that if Reuven became Shimon's partner before Shemitah, and borrowed from him after Shemitah (and admitted to part of the loan), Shimon could (make Reuven swear mid'Oraisa about the loan, and) be Megalgel (an oath about the partnership)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That cannot be, for the Seifa explicitly teaches this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If Reuven became Shimon's partner before Shemitah, and borrowed from him after Shemitah, Shimon can be Megalgel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> One can be Megalgel, even from a mid'Rabanan oath.</p>
