<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An addition that was not made with all of these (does not get Kedushah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This is the correct text.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The text should say 'an addition that was not made with one of these' (does not get Kedushah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(According to Rav Huna, Ezra could not be Mekadesh the second Mikdash, since they lacked the Urim v'Tumim.) Rav Huna must hold that Shlomo's Kedushah of Bayis Rishon was permanent. Ezra's actions were only a commemoration of Kidush.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Nachman holds that the Kedushah of Bayis Rishon had ceased. (According to his text, Ezra was able to be Mekadesh Bayis Sheni, even without the Urim v'Tumim. Tosfos (DH Teni) asks why he changed the text, for in any case there are Stam Mishnayos that hold that the first Kedushah was permanent.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> An addition that was not made with all of these (does not get Kedushah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The text should say 'an addition that was not made with one of these.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Aba Sha'ul):</span> There were two swamps on the Mount of Olives. The lower one was Mekudash with everything mentioned in the Mishnah (during the first Mikdash), and the upper one was Mekudash by the exiles who returned from Bavel, without a king or the Urim v'Tumim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The lower swamp had full Kedushah. Ignoramuses would eat Kodshim Kalim there, but not Ma'aser Sheni. Chaverim (people who properly guard the laws) would eat Kodshim Kalim and Ma'aser Sheni there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The upper swamp did not have full Kedushah. Ignoramuses would eat Kodshim Kalim there, but not Ma'aser Sheni. Chaverim would not eat Kodshim Kalim nor Ma'aser Sheni there.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They could not fully be Mekadesh it, for to add on to Yerushalayim or the Azarah we need a king, a prophet, the Urim v'Tumim, the great Sanhedrin of 71, two loaves of a Todah and singing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why were they Mekadesh it?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Beraisa said that they could not be Mekadesh it!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, why did they build a new wall including it within Yerushalayim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was the easiest place for enemies to attack from and conquer Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue (below) about whether the Kedushah of the first Mikdash ceased. (Rav Nachman holds like the opinion that it ceased.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DID THE FIRST KEDUSHAH CEASE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rather, the following Tana'im argue about whether or not the first Kedushah ceased. (A Mishnah (Erchin 32a) lists walled cities - old Ketzarah of Tzipori...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> Chachamim listed cities that the returning exiles (from Bavel) were Mekadesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Kedushah of walled cities (from the days of Yehoshua) ceased when the Kedushah of Eretz Yisrael ceased (when Nebuchadnetzar conquered it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi holds that the first Kedushah ceased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> The cities listed are not the only walled cities. Moshe conquered "Shishim Ir... Mamleches Og... Betzuros Chomah!" We list only the cities that the returning exiles found and were Mekadesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> The Seifa (of this Beraisa) says that they did not need to be Mekadesh them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, we list cities known to have had a wall;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If there is a tradition about another city that it had a wall when Yehoshua entered Eretz Yisrael, the Mitzvos of walled cities (one who sells a house has a year to redeem it, and a Metzora cannot stay there) apply also to it, because the first Kedushah remains.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Tana'im of these two Beraisos argue about his opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The latter Beraisa is really R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> "Asher Lo Chomah" - 'Lo' is spelled with an Aleph, to hint that even if now it does not have a wall, but once it did, it is considered a walled city (because the first Kedushah remains).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he became Tamei in the Azarah and forgot...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one is liable (lashes or Kares) if he became Tamei in the Azarah (and did not leave immediately)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar (the Amora)):</span> It says "Es Mishkan Hash-m Timei" and "Es Mikdash Hash-m Timei";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not need two verses for when he became Tamei outside and entered, so one teaches about when he became Tamei inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need both for when he became Tamei outside!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar (the Tana)):</span> The Torah needed to teach that he is liable for the Mishkan and the Mikdash, because we could not learn from one to the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had it taught only about the Mishkan, one might have thought that this is because it was anointed with the anointing oil!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Had it taught only about the Mikdash, one might have thought that this is because its Kedushah is permanent! (Rashi - once the Mikdash was built, private altars were forbidden forever; Tosfos - it endured longer than the Mishkan, or because it can be rebuilt only in the same place.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar (the Amora) expounded the change of expression.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the Mishkan is called Mikdash and vice-versa, the Torah could have written both times 'Mishkan' or 'Mikdash', and we would have known to include both;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It changed the expression to teach another law as well (when he became Tamei inside).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>We know that the Mishkan is called Mikdash - "v'Nasati Mishkani b'Sochechem";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the Mikdash is called Mishkan?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from "v'Nase'u ha'Kehasim Nose'ei ha'Mikdash."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That does not refer to the Mikdash itself, rather to the Aron (and the Kelim of the Mikdash.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one is Mishtachaveh (bows) or delays long enough to be Mishtachaveh...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> (He is liable for a quick Hishtachava'ah.) This is when he bows towards the west (where the Divine Presence is);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he bows towards the east, he is liable only if he delays (the time of a proper Hishtachava'ah).</p>
