<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FOR WHICH OATHS IS ONE LIABLE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> One is liable (a Korban) only for oaths about the future - "Lehara Oh Leheitiv."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva) Question:</span> "Lehara Oh Leheitiv" connotes oaths of doing harm (to oneself) or benefiting. What is the source to include 'neutral' oaths?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Oh Nefesh."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Lehara Oh Leheitiv" connotes oaths of the future. What is the source to include oaths of the past?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "L'Chol Asher Yevatei."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yishmael says, "Lehara Oh Leheitiv" teaches only oaths of the future.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> What is your source for neutral oaths?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Extra words in the verse ("l'Chol Asher Yevatei") include them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Just like they include neutral oaths, they include also oaths of the past. (End of Beraisa)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can R. Yishmael answer R. Akiva's challenge?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yishmael learned from R. Nechunyah ben Hakaneh, who expounds according to Klal u'Frat (general terms and specific terms). R. Akiva learned from Nachum Ish Gam Zu, who expounds according to Ribuy and Mi'ut (inclusions and exclusions);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "Oh Nefesh Ki Sishava" is a Ribuy. "Lehara Oh Leheitiv" is a Mi'ut. "L'Chol Asher Yevatei" is another Ribuy;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>From a Ribuy, Mi'ut, Ribuy we (initially) include everything, then we exclude one thing, other cases oaths about Mitzvos (Tosfos - also, oaths that do not apply in the positive and negative, and (according to Shmuel) oaths that do not apply to the future).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yishmael expounds according to Klal u'Frat. "Oh Nefesh..." is a Klal. "Lehara Oh Leheitiv" is a Prat. "L'Chol Asher Yevatei" is another Klal;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>From a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal we include things similar to the specific, i.e. in the future;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The Klal includes 'neutral' oaths. The Prat excludes oaths, even of benefit or harm, in the past.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not say the contrary (and include oaths of the past, but exclude 'neutral' oaths)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak):</span> They should resemble "Lehara Oh Leheitiv", i.e. the Isur (of a false oath) is due to "Lo Yachel Devaro";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Isur of false oaths of the past is due to "Lo Seshakeru."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yitzchak bar Avin):</span> "Ki <i>Sishava Levatei</i>" - the Shevu'ah must precede the Bituy (the action he swears about), and not vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This excludes 'I ate' or 'I did not eat', for the action preceded the oath.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MISTAKEN OATHS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ha'Adam bi'Shvu'ah" excludes Ones. "V'Nelam" excludes Mezid. "Mi'Menu" - he forgot the oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he is liable even if he forgot that this is the item he swore about!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Bi'Shvu'ah v'Nelam" - he is liable for forgetting the oath, but not for forgetting the item.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said that "ha'Adam bi'Shvu'ah" excludes Ones. What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like the case of Rav Kahana and Rav Asi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After learning from Rav, they argued about what Rav said. Each swore 'this is what Rav said.' Later Rav said like one of them. The other was worried that he had sworn falsely.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> Don't worry. This was Ones. (You swore what you believed was the truth.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Bi'Shvu'ah v'Nelam" - he is liable for forgetting the oath, but not for forgetting the item.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael laughed at this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is possible to forget the oath and remember the item, e.g. he swore not to eat wheat bread, and thought that he swore 'I will eat', and knowingly ate it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> How can one remember the oath and forget the item?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He swore not to eat wheat bread, and thought that he swore not to eat barley bread;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He remembered the oath (that he would not eat), but he forget which item he swore about.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since he forgot which item he swore about, he forgot the oath!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The text of the Beraisa is mistaken. Any case of forgetting the item must entail forgetting the oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rebuttal (Rav Yosef):</span> One can forget the item without forgetting the oath!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He swore not to eat wheat bread, and took what he thought was barley bread, but really it was wheat bread!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> He is liable for what he ate. He did not know that he was eating what he swore about! (A second version in the Gemara asks this same question in different words.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Since he would not have eaten had he known that it was wheat, this is called forgetting the item.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If he forget the item and the oath, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Since he forgot the oath, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not say the contrary, since he forgot the item, he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> It depends. If he would have refrained had he remembered the oath, this is like forgetting the oath, and he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he would have refrained had he remembered the item, this is like forgetting the item, and he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Ravina):</span> If he only remembered one of them, he would not refrain!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> Rather, the law is the same in both cases. (Rashi - he is exempt; Rashba - Ravina did not decide what the law is.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> When does one bring a Korban for an oath of Bituy of the past?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he intentionally swore falsely, he is Mezid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he believed that he swore truthfully, he is Ones!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> He swore falsely, knowing that this is forbidden, but he did not know whether a Korban is brought for such oaths.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like Munvaz, who says that if one knowingly sinned, unaware that a Korban is brought for this transgression, he must bring a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is even like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim argue only about Korbanos for other Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We learn from idolatry that Korbanos are brought only for transgressions punishable by Kares (if done b'Mezid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Korban for Shevu'as Bituy is a Chidush. Since this is only a Lav, Chachamim agree that forgetting the Korban suffices to obligate a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO IS SUFFERING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If one swore not to eat a loaf, and later was in danger of starving and ate it (forgetting that he swore not to eat it), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If he is in danger, he was permitted to eat it. He did not transgress!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Correction:</span> Rather, if he swore not to eat a loaf, and was suffering great hunger and ate it, forgetting his oath), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Correction:</span> Rather, if he swore not to eat a loaf, and was pained that he remembered his oath (he wished he had forgotten it, for then he could eat it), and ate it, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 - Rambam - Correction:</span> Rather, if he swore not to eat a loaf, and was suffering great hunger and ate it, thinking that this is permitted (due to his pain), what is the law? (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If one would have refrained had he known that he is transgressing, he brings a Korban. One who would have transgressed anyway does not. (Since he would have eaten it anyway (Tosfos - wanted to eat it), he is exempt.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MUST THE OATH BE SPOKEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It does not suffice to think the oath. He must say it - "Levatei bi'Sfasayim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Bi'Sfasayim" - not in the heart;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source (that it is an oath) even if he resolved in his heart?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "l'Chol Asher Yevatei."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This contradicts the Reisha, which said that an oath in the heart is not an oath!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> "Bi'Sfasayim" excludes one who resolved to say an oath, and never uttered it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he resolved to accept an oath in his heart, this is binding.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>This understanding of the Beraisa argues with Shmuel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for Shmuel, and Answer #2 to explain the Beraisa - Rav Sheshes):</span> "Bi'Sfasayim" excludes one who wanted to swear 'I will not eat wheat bread', and he mistakenly said 'I will not eat barley bread';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he wanted to swear 'I will not eat wheat bread', and he mistakenly swore 'I will not eat bread', what is the source that this is an oath?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "l'Chol Asher Yevatei."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Motzei Sefasecha Tishmor" refers to what he uttered (vows to bring Korbanos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source (that it is a vow) even if he decided in his heart?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol Nediv Lev" (donated towards the Mishkan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Speech is not needed to make Hekdesh, like we learn from "Kol Nediv Lev", but it is needed for an oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn that the same applies to oaths!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We do not learn, because Terumah and Kodshim are Shnei Kesuvim ha'Ba'in k'Echad (two verses, one of which teaches something that could have been learned from the other, in this case that deciding in the heart is enough). They do not teach about other laws. (Rashi - this refers to Terumas (donations to) ha'Mishkan and Korbanos; Tosfos - it is Terumah (of grain) and Korbanos; R. Chananel, Tosfos ha'Rosh - it is Terumah (of grain) and donations to the Mishkan. For each of these, a <i>Torah</i> verse teaches that speech is not needed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that Shnei Kesuvim ha'Ba'in k'Echad do not teach about other laws;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that Shnei Kesuvim <i>do</i>teach about other laws, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We do not learn laws of Chulin (oaths) from Kodshim.</p>
