<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO WAS WARNED NOT TO SWEAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> If Levi was warned not to swear falsely Shevu'as ha'Pikadon (but did so b'Mezid), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shevu'as ha'Pikadon is a Chidush (exception). One brings a Korban for Mezid, unlike the general rule. Therefore, the law is the same even if he was warned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps that is only if he was not warned, but if he was warned, he is lashed and he does not bring a Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Or, perhaps he is lashed and brings a Korban'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha, Rav Shmuel and R. Yitzchak - Beraisa):</span> Shevu'as ha'Pikadon is more stringent (than Shevu'as ha'Edus). He is lashed if he was Mezid, and he brings an Asham if he was Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he is lashed, surely he was warned. It says only that he is lashed (for Mezid), implying that he does not bring a Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is more stringent than Shevu'as ha'Edus (for which one brings a Chatas if Mezid) since one prefers to bring a Korban than to be lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rava bar Isi):</span> This Beraisa is like R. Shimon, who says that there is no atonement (Korban) for Mezid Shevu'as ha'Pikadon. Chachamim would say that he also brings a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rav Kahana):</span> I myself recited that Beraisa. The correct text says 'whether he was Mezid or Shogeg, he brings an Asham that costs at least two Shekalim';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is more stringent than Shevu'as ha'Edus, for which one may bring a Chatas costing as little as a Ma'ah (a sixth of a Dinar).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Kahana should have settled his question from the Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the Beraisa discusses when he was not warned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> He is exempt if he believed that he was swearing truthfully. When liable, he brings an Asham that costs at least two Shekalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, he was warned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he was not warned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> We cannot learn from a Tamei Nazir, for he is lashed, to Shevu'as ha'Pikadon, for which one is not lashed! (It is not clear which law the Beraisa thought to learn from a Tamei Nazir);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the Tamei Nazir is lashed, we must say that he was warned, and it says that (in a similar case) he is not lashed for Shevu'as ha'Pikadon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Beraisa means, regarding Shevu'as ha'Pikadon, one does not get full atonement through lashes (he needs also a Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that a Nazir Tamei gets full atonement through lashes. The Torah explicitly says that he brings a Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Korban is not for atonement, rather in order to enable him to begin Nezirus in Taharah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IF WITNESSES KNOW THAT HE OWES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rabah heard Rav Kahana's question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> If he was warned, this implies that witnesses know that he is liable. If so, his denial is useless (since the witnesses will force him to pay)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Rabah holds that one who denies money that witnesses know about is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (R. Chinena - Beraisa):</span> "V'Chichesh Bah" excludes one who admits to one of the brothers or partners who claimed from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Nishba Al Shaker" excludes one who borrowed with a document or witnesses (he is exempt because he will have to pay).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rabah):</span> No. The case is, he admits that he borrowed, but he denies that there was a document or witnesses who saw the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should we assume that that is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, it is similar to the Reisha, admitting to one of the partners.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is that case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He admitted that he owed half to one partner.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he should be liable for denying the other half!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they say that they lent to him together, and he admits to borrowing the entire amount from one partner.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like he does not save himself money through this denial, also in the Seifa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> He is exempt if he believed that he was swearing truthfully.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Mezid, he brings an Asham that costs at least two Shekalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means, we know through witnesses that he was Mezid (i.e. they warned him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means only that he swore falsely b'Mezid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If there were two pairs of witnesses, and one pair denied after the other (both pairs are liable).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand why the second pair is liable. The first pair already denied, so the denial of the second pair stops the claimant from collecting;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, when the first pair denied, this did not stop the claimant from collecting. The second pair could have testified!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> One is liable for denying, even though there are (other) witnesses who (if they testify) will enable the claimant to get what he deserves!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">37b----------------------------------------37b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The case is, when the first pair denied, the second pair were invalid witnesses, because they were related (Rashi - to each other; R. Chananel - to a party of the case) through their wives, who were Gosesos (close to death);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since most Gosesim die, the second pair is destined to become valid and the first pair is exempt. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so, since now they are alive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Shomer (watchman) claimed that the deposit was stolen; swore falsely, admitted that he lied, and witnesses testified that the Shomer himself took it:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he admitted before witnesses came, he pays principal, a Chomesh, and brings an Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he admitted after witnesses came, he pays double and brings an Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, we can answer like Ravina answered (when he denied, the witnesses were invalid because they were related through their wives).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Beraisa):</span> Shevu'as ha'Pikadon is more stringent (than Shevu'as ha'Edus). He is lashed if he was Mezid, and he brings an Asham if he was Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he is lashed, surely there were witnesses, and if he was Shogeg; he brings a Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mordechai):</span> Rav Kahana recited the correct text of that Beraisa: 'whether he was Mezid or Shogeg, he brings an Asham that costs at least two Shekalim.';</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> We cannot learn from a Tamei Nazir, for he is lashed, to Shevu'as ha'Pikadon, for which one is not lashed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the Tamei Nazir is lashed, surely there were witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> In the corresponding case of Shevu'as ha'Pikadon, he is not lashed, but he brings a Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This refutes Rabah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SPECIAL LAWS OF LAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one denies money that witnesses know about, he is liable. If there is a document, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> What is R. Yochanan's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> He obligates regarding witnesses, for they might die (and he will avoid paying through his denial);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He exempts regarding a document, for the claimant will surely collect (the defendant gains nothing by denying).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> A document can be lost (the claimant is not guaranteed to collect)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> A document creates a lien on land. We do not swear about (land, or) money that can be collected from (even sold) land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan or R. Elazar):</span> If witnesses about land falsely swore (Shevu'as ha'Edus), they are liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Yochanan and R. Elazar):</span> They are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Yochanan must hold that they are exempt, for he taught that one who denies money that witnesses know about is liable, but if there is a document, he is exempt, like Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua explained.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (R. Yirmeyah):</span> R. Yochanan and R. Elazar argue like R. Eliezer and Chachamim argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> (If Reuven stole Shimon's field and) the river flooded it, he must give to him another field;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he can say 'your field is in front of you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar expounds through the method of Ribuy and Mi'ut (inclusions and exclusions);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"He will deny his neighbor" is a Ribuy; "about a deposit" is a Mi'ut; "anything he will swear about" is another Ribuy;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>From the Ribuy, Mi'ut, Ribuy we include everything (that one must swear about them, and return them if stolen). We exclude only documents (for they have no intrinsic value).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Chachamim expound the the method of Klal u'Frat (general and specific terms);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"He will deny his neighbor" is a Klal; "about a deposit" is a Prat; "anything he will swear about" is another Klal;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>From the Klal u'Frat u'Chlal we include everything similar to the Prat, i.e. Metaltelim (things that can be moved) and have intrinsic value;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>We exclude land, for it cannot be moved, and also slaves, for these are equated to land;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>We exclude documents, which have no intrinsic value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Elazar obligates the witnesses. This is like R. Eliezer. R. Yochanan exempts, like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Avahu):</span> Indeed, Chachamim must hold like R. Yochanan, but R. Eliezer could also agree to R. Yochanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "<i>mi</i>'Kol (that he will swear about)", not everything, to exclude land from oaths (even though it can be stolen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Our Mishnah is like the opinion that one is exempt for land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It teaches that one who denied stealing an ox is liable, but one who denied stealing a slave would be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is because slaves are equated to land, and our Tana holds that we do not swear about land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papi - Seifa):</span> The general rule is, if the defendant would have had to pay by his own admission he is liable. If not, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'The general rule' comes to include stealing slaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The inferences contradict each other. We do not know which is correct.</p>
