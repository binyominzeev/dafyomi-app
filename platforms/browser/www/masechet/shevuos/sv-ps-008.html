<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ATONEMENT FOR OTHER SINS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it atones for idolatry, Arayos, and murder.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of idolatry?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he served b'Mezid, he is Chayav Misah (he should be executed! Surely the goat does not atone for him!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he served b'Shogeg, he must bring a Korban! (Surely the goat does not exempt him from this!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He served b'Mezid without warning (so Beis Din does not kill him);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He served b'Shogeg and never realized his sin (so he is not yet liable to bring a Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of Arayos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he sinned b'Mezid, he is Chayav Misah. If he sinned b'Shogeg, he must bring a Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can say that he sinned b'Mezid without warning, or b'Shogeg and never realized his sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of murder?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he killed b'Mezid, he is Chayav Misah. If he killed b'Shogeg, he must be exiled in a city of refuge! (Surely the goat does not exempt him from this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can say that he killed b'Mezid without warning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, he killed b'Shogeg and never realized it, or in a way that is exempt from exile (e.g. he was engaged in an upward motion).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FOR WHICH TUM'OS DOES IT ATONE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it atones for these three transgressions!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It atones "mi'Tum'os", but not from all Tum'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tum'os are have a special law? (Presumably, the verse refers to these.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are Tum'ah of the Mikdash and Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what respect do these Tum'os have a special law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Korban for them is an Oleh v'Yored.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also idolatry has a special law! The Korban Chatas for idolatry must be a female goat. A regular Chatas can be a female lamb or goat! (We should say that the inner goat atones for idolatry!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> The inner goat atones for something that has a special leniency, and not a special stringency.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A woman who gave birth has a special leniency. She brings an Oleh v'Yored!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Hoshaya):</span> "L'Chol Chatosom" does not apply, for her Korban is for Tum'ah, and not for a sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Shimon, who says that the Korban is to atone in case she swore during labor that she will never have relations with her husband again, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is no question according to R. Shimon. He says that "v'Chiper Al ha'Kodesh" teaches that it atones for Tum'os of the Mikdash and Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Metzora has a special leniency (he brings an Oleh v'Yored)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Hoshaya):</span> "L'Chol Chatosom" does not apply, for his Korban is for Tum'ah, and not for a sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani, who says that Tzara'as comes for seven sins, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tzara'as atoned for him. The Korban is only to permit him to eat Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Nazir Tamei has a special leniency. He brings pigeons or doves (in place of animals)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Hoshaya):</span> "L'Chol Chatosom" does not apply, for his Korban is for Tum'ah, and not for a sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Eliezer ha'Kapar, who says that a Nazir is a sinner (for denying himself wine), how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He must hold like R. Shimon (who learns from "v'Chiper Al ha'Kodesh").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Yehudah learn like R. Shimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He uses "v'Chiper Al ha'Kodesh" to teach that the blood is sprinkled in the Heichal the same way it is sprinkled in the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim (once downwards, and seven times upwards).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon learns this from "v'Chen Ya'aseh l'Ohel Mo'ed."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah holds that if we only learned from that verse, one might have thought that he slaughters another bull and goat in order to sprinkle their blood in the Heichal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon holds that the verse connotes that the sprinkles from the same blood mentioned above.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it atones for all transgressions of Tum'os of Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It atones "umi'Pisheihem l'Chol Chatosom" (only for Chata'im that resemble Pesha'im, i.e. there is no Korban for them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This excludes Chata'im in which he knew (of the Tum'ah) at the beginning and (realized his sin) at the end. One brings a Korban for the,. Surely the goat does not exempt him from the Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he realized his sin just before sunset of Erev Yom Kipur, and there was no time to bring the Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought the goat protects him from punishment. The verse teaches that it does not.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that the inner goat protects one who knew at the beginning but not at the end?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana already learned that it atones for something for which one does not bring a Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We taught that it atones for Chata'im that resemble Pesha'im, i.e. there is no Korban for them. The Tana thought to extend this further;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One will never bring a Korban for Peshai'im, and also for such Chata'im in which he did not know at the beginning, but he knew at the end. Perhaps it atones for such Chata'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>However, it would not atone for Chata'im which he knew at the beginning but not at the end, for he brings a Korban for them when he finds out.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could he think that the inner goat atones when he did not know at the beginning but he knew at the end? The outer goat and Yom Kipur atone for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought oppositely, that the inner goat atones when he knew only at the end, and the outer goat atones when he knew only at the beginning;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Umi'Pisheihem l'Chol Chatosom" teaches that the inner goat atones for Chata'im that can result in bringing a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE GOAT OFFERED INSIDE ONLY SUSPENDS PUNISHMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The inner goat should give a full atonement!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said 'mi'Chatosom", that would be true;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, since it says "l'Chol Chatosom", this teaches that a Chatas will later be brought for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since it does not fully atone, why does it suspend punishment?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> If the person dies without finding out, it is considered that he died without sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Death itself atones!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It protects him from punishment (until he realizes his sin).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE GOAT OFFERED OUTSIDE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he never knew of the Tum'ah (and entered the Mikdash or ate Kodshim), and later was told that he was Tamei, the goat (whose blood is) offered outside (the Heichal) and Yom Kipur itself atone for him...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Torah equates the inner and outer goats. We should say that the inner goat also atones for what the outer goat atones for!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This makes a difference if they were unable to bring the outer goat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Chiper... Achas" - the inner goat makes one atonement, but not two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should say that the outer goat also atones for what the inner goat atones for!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This makes a difference for Chata'im of Tum'ah after the inner goat was offered and before the outer goat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Achas b'Shanah" - the atonement of the inner goat comes only once a year.</p>
