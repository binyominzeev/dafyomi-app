<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MALKUS FOR SPEAKING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> We never find that one brings a Korban for speaking!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva himself holds that one who curses Hash-m (b'Shogeg) brings a Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, we never find one who creates a prohibition (that entails a Korban) through speech;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There, the Korban is due to his sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The prohibitions of Nezirus come through speech, and they entail Korbanos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the Korbanos are not for transgressing the prohibitions, rather to (end the Nezirus and) permit him to drink wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One creates Hekdesh through speech, and it entails a Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva refers to Isurim that one forbids to himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hekdesh is forbidden to everyone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Konamos is an Isur to himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that Me'ilah (and therefore Korbanos) do not apply to Konamos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Akiva and Chachamim argue in a case that he does not specify, but if he specifies 'I will not eat Mashehu', (all agree that) he is liable for Mashehu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>By specifying, he gives importance to Mashehu, just like a creation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Akiva and Chachamim argue in a case that he swears 'I will not eat';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if he swore 'I will not taste', he is liable for Mashehu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that 'tasting' refers to eating (i.e. a k'Zayis), as people commonly say. Rava teaches that this is not so</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KONAMOS AND SHEVU'OS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> R. Akiva and Chachamim argue only about Shevu'os, but all agree that for Konamos, one is liable for Mashehu.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also Konamos are like specifying Mashehu, since he does not mention eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> (If one eats less than a Shi'ur from each of) two Konamos, the amounts join up (to the quantity for liability). Two Shevu'os do not join;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says, Konamos are like Shevu'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one is liable for Mashehu for Konamos, there is no need to join up!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, he mentioned 'eating' in each Konam (therefore, he is liable only for a k'Zayis).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, why do they join up? He did not <i>eat</i> (i.e. a k'Zayis) from either!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, he said 'eating from both of these is (forbidden) upon me like Konam (i.e. a Korban).'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the corresponding Shevu'ah is 'I swear that I will not eat from both of them'. Why don't they join up?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Pinchas):</span> Because oaths are separate regarding Korbanos Chatas (one brings a Korban for each oath violated, even if he did not remember in between), they do not join.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Meir say that Konamos are like Shevu'os?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rav Pinchas' law would explain why Shevu'os do not join, but why don't Konamos join? (Even according to the opinion that Me'ilah applies to Konamos, they are not separate for Korbanos Asham.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Meir says that Shevu'os are like Konamos (they join up). He does not agree with Rav Pinchas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> Rav Papa's law is only for lashes. The Beraisa refers only to Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that Chachamim hold that (Korban) Me'ilah applies to Konamos. This is unlike a Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one said 'this loaf is Hekdesh', if he or anyone else eats it, they transgress Me'ilah; therefore, it can be redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he said 'this loaf is Hekdesh upon me', only he transgresses Me'ilah if he eats it. Therefore, it cannot be redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim say, there is no Me'ilah for benefit from Konamos, no matter who eats it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The opinions must be switched;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says that there is no Me'ilah for benefit from Konamos, no matter who eats it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say that only he transgresses Me'ilah if he eats it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Meir say that Konamos do not join? This implies that Me'ilah applies to them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He speaks according to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I hold that Me'ilah does not apply to Konamos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>You hold that it applies, but you should admit that Konamos are like Shevu'os (they do not join).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim argue. Shevu'os do not join, for Rav Pinchas' reason, but Konamos join.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one swore 'I will not eat' and he ate dirt, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one swore 'I will not eat dirt', how much is he liable for? (He asks about Chachamim, but surely R. Akiva obligates for Mashehu. The same applies to the following two questions.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he said 'eat', he refers to (the quantity of eating,) a k'Zayis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since it is not normally eaten, he means Mashehu?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one swore 'I will not eat Chartzan (grape skins or pits), how much is he liable for?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since they are eaten along with the grape, he refers to the quantity of eating, a k'Zayis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since they are not normally eaten by themselves, he means Mashehu!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If a Nazir swore 'I will not eat Chartzan', how much is he liable for?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since a Nazir if forbidden (and liable) for a k'Zayis, he refers to something he was permitted, i.e. less than a k'Zayis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he said 'eat', he refers to a k'Zayis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If one swore 'I will not eat', and he ate Neveilos, Treifos, rodents or insects, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon exempts him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim obligate him? The oath (that Yisrael accepted on Sinai) already obligates him not to eat them (so his oath does not takes effect)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav, Shmuel and R. Yochanan):</span> Because his oath takes effect on permitted food, it also takes effect on forbidden food.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> The Torah forbids only him from eating a k'Zayis of these things. His oath forbids him from eating Mashehu;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We find this according to Chachamim if he specified (Mashehu), or according to R. Akiva even without specifying.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Culmination of answer:</span> A Nazir eating Chartzan is like a regular person eating Neveilos, and Chachamim say that it applies to Mashehu only if he specifies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can resolve Rava's question! (If one swore 'I will not eat dirt', how much is he liable for?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the quantity of Neveilos (without specifying) is a k'Zayis, also for dirt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Rava is unsure about dirt, because it is unfit to eat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Neveilos are proper to eat, just they are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DOES 'EATING' INCLUDE DRINKING?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one swore 'I will not eat' and he ate and drank, he is liable only once (lashes if warned, a Korban if he forgot);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he swore 'I will not eat and I will not drink' and he ate and drank, he is liable twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he swore 'I will not eat' and he ate wheat bread, barley bread and spelt bread, he is liable only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he swore 'I will not eat wheat bread, barley bread or spelt bread', and he ate all three, he is liable for each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he swore 'I will not drink' and he drank many beverages, he is liable only once;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he swore 'I will not drink wine, oil or honey' and he drank all three, he is liable for each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he swore 'I will not eat' and he ate things unfit to eat or drank liquids unfit to drink, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If he swore 'I will not eat', and he ate Neveilos, Treifos, rodents or insects, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Shimon exempts him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If one swore 'Konam, I may not benefit from my wife if I ate today' and he ate Neveilos, Treifos, rodents or insects, she is forbidden to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> If one swore 'I will not eat' and he drank, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>We can learn this from a verse or from reasoning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can learn from reasoning. One says 'let us taste something', and they eat <i>and drink</i>.</p>
