<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Tuvi bar Masna):</span> What is the source in the Torah for Muktzeh (that one must designate a Korban before offering it)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Tishmeru Lehakriv Li" teaches that Korbanos must be guarded for Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Surely, even if someone brings a starved sheep (which was not guarded) for a Korban, we accept it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Tuvi):</span> "Tishmeru l'Hakriv <i>Li</i>" teaches that it must be guarded for Hash-m, and not for others to whom people offer, i.e. idolatry. (Below, Version #1 and Version #2 correspond to the two versions at the end of the previous Daf.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava bar Rav Ada):</span> Muktzeh is forbidden only after it works (Version #1 - for the idolatry; Version #2 - only <i>until</i> it works for the priests. After this, it will not be offered for idolatry.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Ula citing R. Yochanan):</span> Muktzeh is forbidden only after it is given to the priests (Version #1; Version #2 - only until it is given to them to eat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beha citing R. Yochanan):</span> Muktzeh is forbidden only after it is fed vetch of idolatry (Version #1; Version #2 - only until it is fed vetch, to fatten it for the priests).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Aba (to Beha):</span> Do you argue with Ula?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Beha:</span> No. Also Ula means, after (Version #2 - until) it is given to the priests to feed it vetch.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> Had Beha not gone to Eretz Yisrael, he would not have become such a Chacham to answer so well!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak:</span> No, he was also a great Chacham in Bavel (before he went up).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chananyah Trita'ah - Beraisa):</span> Muktzeh is forbidden only after (Version #2 - until) an act is done to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chananyah):</span> This act is shearing it and working with it (Version #1 - for idolatry; Version #2 - for the priests).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>NE'EVAD</i> IS PERMITTED TO PEOPLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> What is Ne'evad?...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source (that it is permitted to people)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> "Mi'Mashkeh Yisrael" teaches that Korbanos must be from things permitted to Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Ne'evad were forbidden to people, we would not need a verse to disqualify it from Hakravah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Sometimes a verse forbids offering something, even though it is forbidden to people!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tereifah is forbidden to people, yet a verse disqualifies it from Hakravah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Min ha'Bakar" is repeated to disqualify a Tereifah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse is needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From "mi'Mashkeh Yisrael," we would disqualify only a Tereifah that was Hukdash, but not a Korban that became Tereifah after it was Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Min ha'Bakar" disqualifies a Korban that became Tereifah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another verse teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Kol Asher Ya'avor Tachas ha'Shevet" excludes a Tereifah (Rashi - whose leg was cut off above the knee. Likewise, all Terefos are excluded. Shitah - a Tereifah is too weak to pass. Rashash (in Bechoros) - a healthy animal crouches "Tachas" when one presses on it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All three verses are needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From "mi'Mashkeh Yisrael" we would disqualify only an animal that was Tereifah from its beginning (from birth, for the verse also alludes to Orlah, which is forbidden from its beginning);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Kol Asher Ya'avor Tachas ha'Shevet" disqualifies a Tereifah that was Hukdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Min ha'Bakar" disqualifies a Korban that became Tereifah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN IS AN <i>ESNAN</i> CONSIDERED <i>PASUL</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What is considered an Esnan? (Esnan Zonah is Pasul for Hakravah; we shall discuss which women are considered Zonah for this law.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one told a Zonah "take this lamb for your hire," even if he gave her 100, they are all forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rebbi says, similarly, if Reuven told Shimon "take this lamb, in exchange for which your Shifchah will sleep with my slave," it is not an Esnan;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, it is an Esnan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> Even if he gave her 100, they are all forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If her wages are 100 lambs, obviously all are forbidden. This is not different than one!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, her hire is one lamb. He gave her 100 (Shitah - first he gave one, then another 99). They are all given for Esnan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If Reuven gave (an animal) to a Zonah and did not have relations with her, or had relations with her but did not give her anything, the Esnan is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> If he gave to her and did not have relations with her, this is not called an Esnan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> If he had relations with her but did not give her anything, what Esnan is discussed?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, if he gave to her and <i>afterwards</i> had relations with her, or had relations with her and <i>afterwards</i> gave to her, the Esnan is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the former case, when he has relations with her the Esnan should become retroactively forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> The case is, she already offered it (before relations).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he immediately transferred ownership to her, obviously it is valid. They did not have relations yet!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he told her that it will not be hers until relations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, she cannot (be Makdish nor) offer it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Ish Ki Yakdish Es Beiso Kodesh" teaches that one can be Makdish only things in his possession, like his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He said "I will leave it with you until we have relations. If you need it, you may acquire it from now."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Oshaya):</span> If she was Makdish it (but did not offer it) before they had relations, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can learn from R. Elazar!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If she offered it before relations, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He is Machshir only if it was already offered and is not around at the time of relations, but not if it was only Hukdash!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Oshaya was unsure about R. Elazar's opinion:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Perhaps R. Elazar permits only when it was offered, but if it was only Hukdash, it becomes forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, perhaps, since a declaration to Hekdesh is like an acquisition to a person, is it as if she offered it (it is valid, and she may offer it later), and all the more so if she already offered it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN IS AN <i>ESNAN</i> CONSIDERED <i>PASUL</i>? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Our explanation of Beraisa #1):</span> If he had relations with her and afterwards gave to her, the Esnan is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> If he had relations with her and afterwards gave to her, even after a year, the Esnan is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Rav Chanan bar Rav Chisda):</span> In Beraisa #2, he said "have relations with me for <i>this</i> lamb." In Beraisa #1, he said "have relations with me for <i>a</i> lamb."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even if he said "for this lamb" it is permitted, for she did not do Meshichah (take it to her premises to acquire it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, she is a Nochris, who does not acquire through Meshichah. (Nochrim normally acquire through giving money, and not through Meshichah. Therefore, the lack of Meshichah does not impede her Kinyan.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It refers even to a Yisraelis. The case is, he put the animal in her Chatzer (she acquires at the time of relations).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, she acquired before relations, not after! (Also - obviously, it is forbidden!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He made the animal an Apotiki (specific collateral);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He fixed a time and said "if I do not pay you by then, you may keep the animal."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> An Esnan given to a man (for homosexual relations) or to any Ervah is Pasul, except for his wife when she is Nidah. (Usually, "Ervah" refers to a woman with whom Kidushin does not take effect, e.g. relatives forbidden by Kares. It can include other forbidden relations, therefore we do not challenge Rav from the Seifa of the Beraisa at the bottom of this Daf.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Zonah". His wife is not a Zonah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Levi):</span> Even Esnan of his wife when she is Nidah is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "To'evah". Also this is an abomination.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Zonah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Zonah" excludes <i>Zoneh</i> (what a woman pays to a man to have relations).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rav's source to exclude Zoneh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from Rebbi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Esnan is Pasul only if the relations were forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The following are valid -- Esnan of his wife when she is Nidah, compensation for money a Zonah could have earned (while she was with him), and what a woman paid to a man.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A verse hints to this (last law), but it is not a proof - "uv'Sitech Esnan v'Esnan Lo Nitan Lach va'Tehi l'Hefech."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHO IS A <i>ZONAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rav expound "To'evah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches Abaye's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Esnan of a Nochris Zonah is Pasul. We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "To'evah-To'evah" from "Ki Chol Asher Ya'aseh mi'Chol ha'To'evos ha'Eleh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This verse discusses Arayos with whom Kidushin does not take effect. Likewise, Esnan is Pasul if Kidushin does not take effect with the Zonah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If a Kohen has relations with a Nochris, he is not lashed due to Zonah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The verse that forbids a Zonah to a Kohen says "Lo Yechalel <i>Zar'o</i>". It refers to a woman whose children (from him) are considered his;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This excludes a Nochris, for her children (are Nochrim; they) are not considered related to their (Yisrael) father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>The Esnan of a Yisraelis Zonah is Kosher for a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kidushin takes effect with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>If a Kohen has relations with a Yisraelis Zonah, he is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>Her children (from him) are considered his.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Whether a Zonah is a Nochris or Yisraelis, her Esnan is Pasul. If a Kohen has relations with her he is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Each is learned from the other:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Kohen is lashed for relations with a Yisraelis Zonah. The same applies to a Nochris;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The Esnan of a Nochris Zonah is Pasul. The same applies to that of a Yisraelis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye - Beraisa):</span> Whether a Zonah is a Nochris or Yisraelis, her Esnan is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (for Abaye):</span> The Beraisa is like R. Akiva, who says that Kidushin does not take effect with Chayavei Lavin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(The Seifa forbids an Esnan that a Kohen Gadol gave to a widow.) The Beraisa teaches that the Torah discusses a Zonah with whom Kidushin does not take effect, just like (a Kohen Gadol cannot be Mekadesh) a widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rava, why does the Seifa discuss a (Kohen Gadol and) widow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches a similarity of widow to Esnan:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like there are no lashes for (a Kohen Gadol who had relations with a) widow unless they were warned, a woman who had Zenus (relations without Kidushin) does not become a Zonah unless she was paid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This teaches unlike R. Elazar;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If a bachelor had Zenus with an unmarried woman (i.e. they are unrelated. Really, it does not matter whether or not <i>he</i> is married), she becomes a Zonah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>However, if she already was a Zonah, the Esnan is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (for Abaye):</span> The Beraisa forbids Esnan of a Yisraelis Zonah only regarding Arayos with whom Kidushin does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa of Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen Gadol gave an Esnan to a widow, or a regular Kohen gave to a divorcee or a woman who did Chalitzah, it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kidushin takes effect in these cases!</p>
