<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> Reish Lakish learns from "v'He'erich ha'Kohen Osah Bein Tov u'Vein Ra";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In which Hekdesh do we not distinguish between Tov (Tam) and Ra (Ba'al Mum)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is Bedek ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Osah" teaches that only this needs Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah, but Kodshei Mizbe'ach do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, what does "Osah" exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes a Ba'al Mum me'Ikaro.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Tana d'Vei Levi, what does it exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei Levi - Beraisa):</span> A Ba'al Mum me'Ikaro needs Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Levi's version of the Mishnah):</span> Even a bird or Chayah requires Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Shimon learns from "v'He'erich ha'Kohen Osah Bein Tov u'Vein Ra" - the difference between good and bad is only in Kodshei Mizbe'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Osah" excludes Bedek ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the verse alludes to the difference between good and bad, it should say "Bein Tov <i>l'</i>Ra"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN <i>TAM</i> AND <i>BA'AL MUM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> If they died Tam, they are buried. If they died with Mumim, they are redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refers to Kodshei Mizbe'ach, but Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis are buried whether or not they have Mumim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, the law of Kodshei Mizbe'ach and Bedek ha'Bayis is the same. If they died Tam, they are buried. If they died with Mumim, they are redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This refutes R. Yochanan (who says that Chachamim require Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah for Kodshei Mizbe'ach. We are thinking that in this Beraisa, Chachamim (the first Tana) exempt. It is a mere stringency to bury a Tam that died).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for R. Yochanan):</span> The first Tana permits redeeming a Ba'al Mum me'Ikaro (it was never really Kodshei Mizbe'ach. However, if it became a Ba'al Mum after Hekdesh, it must be buried.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Presumably, this is correct. If the Beraisa discussed a Korban that later became a Ba'al Mum, R. Shimon would argue! (All agree that he requires Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah for Kodshei Mizbe'ach!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The Beraisa discusses a Ba'al Mum me'Ikaro (but Chachamim say that if a Korban became a Ba'al Mum, it must be buried).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This refutes Reish Lakish (who says that Chachamim exempt Kodshei Mizbe'ach)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish says that the Beraisa discusses a Korban that became a Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, R. Shimon should argue (and say that it must be buried)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #1 is mistaken. Reish Lakish asked from a different Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yochanan - Beraisa #2):</span> If they died, whether or not they have Mumim, they are buried;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refers to Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis, but Kodshei Mizbe'ach are redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Shimon says, if they died Tam, they are buried. If they had Mumim, they are redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for R. Yochanan):</span> The first Tana permits redeeming a Ba'al Mum me'Ikaro.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Presumably, this is correct. If he discussed a Korban that later became a Ba'al Mum, R. Shimon would argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes Reish Lakish!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish says that the Beraisa discusses a Korban that became a Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, R. Shimon should argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he argues about both! (Rashi - the Beraisa taught the argument only regarding Bedek ha'Bayis; R. Gershom - the correct text of the Seifa explicitly says that Kodshei Mizbe'ach are buried whether they died Tam or Ba'alei Mumim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (R. Yirmeyah):</span> According to Reish Lakish, Chachamim exempt Kodshei Mizbe'ach from Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah, yet they permit redeeming Ba'alei Mumim that died, and we established this when they became Ba'alei Mumim after Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that we may redeem Kodshim to feed them to dogs!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Zeira):</span> No, the case is, they were slaughtered (we redeem them for people to eat).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Kodshim became blemished and were slaughtered, they must be buried;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, they are redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT NEEDS <i>HA'AMADAH V'HA'ARACHAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> According to R. Shimon, who exempts Bedek ha'Bayis from Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah, if a Tam died, why is it buried?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> This is a stringency, because it was fitting to be (sold for a Korban and) offered;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was Matfis a Tam for Bedek ha'Bayis, one may redeem it only in order to offer it for a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Anything (Hekdesh) fitting for the Mizbe'ach must be offered on the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> R. Yochanan establishes the Beraisa to discuss a Ba'al Mum me'Ikaro. All agree that it does not need Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah. A Mishnah refutes this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Makdish an animal with a Mum Kavu'a for any Korban (except for Bechor or Ma'aser), the following laws apply:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>After redemption, (if it will have a firstborn male,) Kedushas Bechor applies to it; Matanos must be given (when it is slaughtered); it becomes Chulin regarding shearing it and working with it (these are permitted); and its offspring and milk are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>(Even before redemption), one who slaughters it outside (the Mikdash) is exempt. It cannot make Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If it died, it is redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This is like R. Shimon, who requires Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah for Kodshei Mizbe'ach, and exempts Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis died, they are redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon agrees that a Ba'al Mum me'Ikaro (of Kodshei Mizbe'ach that died) is redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Osah" excludes a Ba'al Mum me'Ikaro.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim say that a Ba'al Mum me'Ikaro needs Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye or Rava):</span> The Chachamim Rav refers to are Tana d'Vei Levi (who explicitly requires Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah for a Ba'al Mum me'Ikaro).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Rav should have said that our Mishnah is like R. Shimon and his opponent (the Chachamim who argue with him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav holds like Reish Lakish, who says that Chachamim require Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah for Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis, but not for Kodshei Mizbe'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Reisha of that Mishnah says that if it died, it is redeemed (indeed, this is even like Chachamim). However, the Seifa says that if it (a Korban that later got a Mum) died, it is buried. This is only like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav holds like R. Yochanan. Indeed, the correct text of Rav's teaching is "our Mishnah is like R. Shimon and his opponent."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>NIKBARIM</i> AND <i>NISRAFIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following (Isurei Hana'ah) are Nikbarim (they must be buried):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A miscarriage or Shilya (fetal sac) of  Kodshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>An ox sentenced to be stoned, Eglah Arufah (a calf beheaded for atonement when a murdered corpse is found), Tziporei Metzora (a bird slaughtered for Taharah of a Metzora or of a house that had Tzara'as), hair of a Nazir, a firstborn donkey (that was not redeemed), meat cooked with milk, and Chulin slaughtered in the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon says, Chulin b'Azarah are buried. Likewise, a Chayah slaughtered in the Mikdash is buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The following are Nisrafim (must be burned);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chametz during Pesach, Tamei Terumah, Orlah, and Kil'ai ha'Kerem;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(Rashi - regarding Orlah and Kil'ai ha'Kerem,) what it is normal to burn is burned, and what it is normal to bury (but cannot be burned) is buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We burn bread and oil of (Tamei) Terumah (and we may benefit from the fire).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All Kodshei Doros slaughtered (with intent) Chutz li'Zemano or Chutz li'Mekomo;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Asham Taluy (brought to atone for a Safek Kares, if the owner found out before Zerikah that indeed he did not sin);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehudah says, Asham Taluy is buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Chatas ha'Of ha'Ba Al ha'Safek (it is brought when in doubt);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Yehudah says, it is cast into the Amah (a stream that flows through the Mikdash).</p>
