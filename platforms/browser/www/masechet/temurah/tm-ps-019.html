<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS <i>SHEM OLAH AL IMO</i> REQUIRED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> R. Elazar does not require Shem Olah Al Imo!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A female Pesach is Ro'eh. We bring Pesach with its Damim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Vlad Pesach is Ro'eh. We bring Pesach with the Damim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the initial Hekdesh was still around after Pesach, it is Ro'eh. We bring Shelamim with the Damim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the Vlad is around after Pesach, it is Ro'eh, We bring Shelamim with the Damim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Elazar says, it itself is offered for Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Even though the Em was not Shelamim, R. Elazar says that the Vlad is offered for Shelamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> After Pesach is different, for Mosar Pesach itself is offered like a Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, R. Elazar should also argue in the Reisha! (Even before Pesach, if Pesach was slaughtered l'Shem Shelamim it is a valid Shelamim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Indeed, he also argues in the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> No, he agrees in the Reisha. He has a tradition that the Vlad is like Mosar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After Pesach, Mosar Pesach is Shelamim, so also Vlad Pesach is Shelamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Before Pesach, the Em has Kedushas Damim for Pesach, so the same applies to the Vlad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ukva bar Chama):</span> We do not say that because the Em has Kedushas Damim for Pesach, the same applies to the Vlad!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A female Pesach and its Vlados are Ro'eh. We bring Pesach with the Damim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar says, the Vlad itself is offered for Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He does not apply the law of the Em to it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The case is, he was Makdish a pregnant animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar holds like R. Yochanan, who holds that one can be Meshayer (stipulate that the fetus be Chulin or a different Korban), and Ubar Lav Yerech Imo (a fetus is considered an independent animal. It is not just a part of the mother);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The mother does not get Kedushas ha'Guf, but the Vlad does!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Mari):</span> Presumably, the Beraisa discusses Hekdesh of a pregnant animal, for it says "it and its Vlados". (It does not mention that it gave birth.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> R. Elazar admits that Vlad Asham is not offered for an Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! R. Elazar says only that Vlad Olah is itself offered for an Olah, because Shem Olah Al Imo. This does not apply to Vlad Asham. Surely he agrees that it is not offered for an Asham!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had R. Yosi not taught this, one might have thought that R. Elazar's reason is not because Shem Olah Al Imo, rather, because the Vlad is Kosher to be offered, and this applies also to Vlad Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, rather than teaching that Vlad Asham is not offered for an Asham, he should have taught that it is not offered for an Olah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had he taught that that, one might have thought it is not offered for an Olah because its mother was not Hukdash for an Olah, but it is offered for an Asham. R. Yosi teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A FEMALE <i>ASHAM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Makdish a female for an Asham, it is Ro'eh until it gets a Mum. We bring an Asham with its Damim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If another animal was already offered for the Asham, the Damim goes to Nedavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon says, it may be sold without a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why must it get a Mum? Since we cannot offer it, this should be like a Mum to permit selling it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> Because it gets Kedushas Damim, it gets Kedushas ha'Guf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava (Tzon Kodashim's text - Rabah)):</span> This teaches that if one was Makdish a male for its value (to buy an Olah), it gets Kedushas ha'Guf (it itself is offered for an Olah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If one was Makdish a male for its value, it gets Kedushas ha'Guf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It does not get Kedushas ha'Guf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rava retracted due to Rav Yehudah's teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> It may be sold without a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> He should say that because it gets Kedushas Damim, it gets Kedushas ha'Guf!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> This is as he holds elsewhere, that something that cannot be offered does not get Kedushas ha'Guf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a second year ram was brought for an Asham that must be a yearling, or if a yearling was brought for an Asham that must be in its second year, it is valid, but the owner was not Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, it is not Kodesh at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon says that Mechusar Zeman (an animal that cannot be offered now) gets Kedushas ha'Guf!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There is different, for it can be offered later.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, also a yearling Hukdash for a second-year Asham should get Kedushas ha'Guf!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, R. Shimon learns from Bechor:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Yehudah citing R. Shimon):</span> An animal less than eight days old enters the pen for Ma'aser even though it is Mechusar Zeman (no animal may be offered before eight days);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn from Bechor. It becomes Kodesh (at birth) before it can be offered, and it is offered in the proper time (after eight days).</p>
