<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Avin bar Chiya - Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> (Temuras Asham and its) Vlados for all generations must be left to graze (Ro'eh) and get a Mum. We bring Olah with the proceeds from its sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Vlados themselves are not offered!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avin bar Kahana):</span> The case is, the Vlados are females. (Males could be offered.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Avin bar Chiya):</span> Does the Mishnah discuss the case when all descendants for all generations are female?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Avin bar Kahana:</span> I give you a poor answer. Yes, that is the case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Text of the Gra, and possibly Rashi) Question:</span> This implies that he had a better answer to give. What else could he answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Vlados Temuras Asham are different, for we are concerned lest one err (and offer them for an Asham).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TEMURAH OF A BECHOR AND MA'ASER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Temurah of Bechor or Ma'asar Behemah, and their Vlados for all generations are like Bechor and Ma'aser. They are eaten when they get a Mum;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Ba'alei Mumim of all Kodshim may be slaughtered and sold in the Itliz (meat market) and by weight, except for Bechor and Ma'aser. (This is because money received for Bechor and Ma'aser belongs to the owner, but money received for other Kodshim is used to buy a similar Korban.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Ba'alei Mumim of all Kodshim and Temuros may be redeemed, except for Bechor and Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>All Kodshim may be brought from Chutz la'Aretz, except for Bechor and Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Tam was brought, it is offered; if a Ba'al Mum was brought, the owner eats it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon says, the reason (why they should not be brought) is because they can be eaten in Chutz la'Aretz (once they get a Mum), but other Kodshim remain Kadosh even with a Mum. (Even though they can be redeemed, one must buy another Korban with the Damim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara - Rava bar Rav Aza) Question (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> If one blemished Temuras Bechor or Ma'aser, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps one is exempt, because they cannot be offered;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps one is liable, because they are Kedoshim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Abaye):</span> Why didn't you ask about blemishing a Teshi'i (an animal that left the pen ninth and was mistakenly called "Asiri (tenth)"? (Also it may not be eaten until it gets a Mum!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Surely, the reason you didn't ask is because "Asiri" excludes a Teshi'i. (It is not offered, so one is not liable for blemishing it);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Likewise, "Lo Sifdeh Kodesh Hem" excludes Temuras Bechor and Ma'aser!</p>

(We bring a long Beraisa in which (on 21b, after a brief interruption) R. Akiva expounds that we do not offer a Bechor from Chutz la'Aretz. R. Yishmael uses R. Akiva's verse for a different law, so presumably he permits offering it.  In this entire discussion, "Ma'aser" refers to Ma'aser Sheni.)</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from them, for both of them are put on or in front of the Mizbe'ach. This does not apply to Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Tana's opinion (about the Kedushah of Yerushalayim)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he holds that the Kedushah is permanent (i.e. even after the Churban), also Bechor is permitted nowadays! (Also the Kedushah of the Mikdash is permanent, so we could build the Mizbe'ach in its place and offer Korbanos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If he holds that the Kedushah was not permanent (it is Batel after the Churban), he should be equally unsure about Bechor!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that the Kedushah was not (our text, Rashi; Tosfos - was) permanent. The case is, the Bechor's blood was thrown before the Churban, and the meat is intact after the Churban;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The meat is equated to the blood. Just like the blood requires a Mizbe'ach (to be offered), also the meat (may not be eaten without a Mizbe'ach);</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> The only difference between Shilo and Yerushalayim (regarding what may be eaten inside) is that Kodshim Kalim and Ma'aser were permitted b'Chol ha'Ro'eh of Shilo, but only within the walls of Yerushalayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In both of them, Kodshei Kodashim may be eaten only within the Kela'im (i.e. in the Azarah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One might have thought that Ma'aser may be eaten b'Chol ha'Ro'eh of Yerushalayim, similar to Shilo. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
