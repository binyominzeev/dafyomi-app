<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>CHATA'OS</i> THAT ARE NOT OFFERED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven offered another animal in place of his Chatas (which he lost, and later it was found), the first Chatas must die;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If another Chatas was offered in place of a (lost) Chatas Tzibur, the first Chatas need not die;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, Tamus (it must die).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon says of the five Chata'os that must die (a tradition from Moshe from Sinai teaches this), three of them apply only to individuals - Vlad Chatas (the Tzibur brings only males), Temuras Chatas (Korbanos Tzibur cannot make Temurah), and a Chatas whose owners died (the Tzibur never dies);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>(The other two can apply to the Tzibur, i.e. she'Kipru Ba'aleha (another Chatas was brought in place of it) or it was not offered within its first year.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Likewise, the law of "Tamus" of the other two applies only to individuals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Chatas Yavi"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> What is the source that if a Chatas was lost and another was Hukdash to replace it, and later the first was found, that one may offer either of them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Chatas Yavi".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he may offer both of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yevi'enah" teaches that he brings <i>it</i> (one), and not two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we do with the other?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Hamnuna - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> It is Ro'eh (grazes until it gets a Mum. It is redeemed, and the money is used to bring Olos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says, Tamus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In our Mishnah, R. Yehudah said Tamus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Answer #1 The opinions (in the Beraisa) must be switched. R. Yehudah says Tamus, and R. Shimon says Ro'eh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> In our Mishnah, R. Shimon agrees that it is one of the five (Chata'os Yachid) that must die!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We need not switch the opinions. R. Yehudah says Tamus only if another Chatas was already offered before the first was found.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Also in the Mishnah, R. Yehudah discusses when another Chatas was already Hukdash, even if it was not offered yet;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Tana'im argue about this.) In our Mishnah he teaches according to Rebbi's opinion. In the Beraisa he teaches according to Chachamim's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>KORBANOS</i> OF THE RETURNING EXILES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, no one says that Chatas Tzibur she'Kipru Ba'aleha must die!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Similarly, (just like the Par Chatas brought on behalf of the Leviyim was not eaten, "those who returned from exile in Bavel) Hikrivu Olos... Parim Sheneim Asar... Tzefirei Chatas Sheneim Asar ha'Kol Olah".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> The 12 Chata'os were not Olos!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> These Chata'os were called Olos because they were not eaten, just like Olos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> The Chata'os were brought for idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The idolatry was done in the days of Tzidkiyahu (at the end of Bayis Rishon).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We are thinking that according to the opinion that Chatas Tzibur she'Kipru Ba'aleha must die, the same applies to Chatas Tzibur she'Mesu Ba'aleha.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The Tzibur had died, yet their Chata'os were offered!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> Even the opinion that Chatas Tzibur she'Kipru Ba'aleha must die, agrees that Chatas Tzibur she'Mesu Ba'aleha need not die, for the Tzibur never dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his source?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He learns from "Tachas Avosecha Yihyeh Vanecha" (it is as if the fathers are alive).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the same should apply to an individual (but all agree that Chatas Yachid she'Mesu Ba'aleha must die)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from Chata'os Tzibur brought on festivals and Rosh Chodesh. They are bought from Terumas ha'Lishkah. We are not concerned lest some of the "owners" (who gave the half-Shekalim) died!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Chata'os were on behalf of the living (returning exiles who had sinned during Bayis Rishon) - "v'Rabim... Asher Ra'u Es ha'Bayis ha'Rishon Bochim b'Kol Gadol v'Rabim bi'Seru'ah".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they were the minority (of the Tzibur that returned)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Ein ha'Am Makirim Kol Teru'as ha'Simchah l'Kol Bechi ha'Am". (Only people who were now at least 83 (were at least 13 at the time of the Churban) were owners of the Korban. Presumably, some of those crying were between 70 and 83. Perhaps those above 83 were the minority! Perhaps a great majority was needed to drown out the sound of the Shofar, and those who were minors at the time of the Churban would not be crying so much, so presumably those above 83 were the majority. Why does it depend only on those who returned? Perhaps the Gemara did not ask, because in any case we conclude that it was a Hora'as Sha'ah, i.e. a special temporary ruling.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The idolatry was b'Mezid. Why were Korbanos brought for it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It was a Hora'as Sha'ah (a special decree).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> We could explain that the 12 bulls and 12 goats were due to idolatry. How could we explain the (98 rams and) 77 lambs?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that it was a Hora'as Sha'ah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE LAST <i>ESHKOLOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Yosi ben Yo'ezer and Yosi ben Yochanan were the last "Eshkolos", i.e. <i><b>ISH</b></i> sheha'<i><b>KOL</b></i> Bo" (one who has Torah, Yir'as Chet and Chesed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> All the Eshkolos from Moshe until the death of Yosi ben Yo'ezer learned Torah like Moshe (flawlessly), but not afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that 3000 Halachos were forgotten during the mourning over Moshe's death!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah that they remembered, they learned like Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> After Moshe died, Halachah was decided by majority rule.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After people declined in Chachmah, they decided forgotten Halachos according to the majority. What they remembered, they learned like Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> There was no Dofi (sin) in the Eshkolos from Moshe until the death of Yosi ben Yo'ezer. Afterwards, there was Dofi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> A case occurred in which a Chasid was groaning. Doctors said that to be cured he must suckle milk every morning. They brought a goat and tied it to his bed. He suckled every morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One day his friends came and saw the goat. They were outraged (because goats eat others' property), and left his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They could not find another thing he had done wrong. He himself, as he was dying, confessed that his only transgression was disobeying the decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Every episode about a Chasid refers to R. Yehudah ben Bava or R. Yehudah bar Ilai, who were long after Yosi ben Yo'ezer!</p>
