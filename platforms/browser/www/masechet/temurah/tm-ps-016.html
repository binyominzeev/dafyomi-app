<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FORGOTTEN <i>HALACHOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Beraisa #1 means, there was no Dofi (argument) about Semichah in the Eshkolos until the death of Yosi ben Yo'ezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yosi ben Yo'ezer himself argued about Semichah (with Yosi ben Yochanan)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was at the end of his life, when Chachmah decreased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Three thousand Halachos were forgotten during the mourning over Moshe's death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They asked Yehoshua to ask Hash-m. He refused, for "Lo va'Shamayim Hi." They asked Shmuel (400 years later) to ask Hash-m. He answered "Eleh ha'Mitzvos" - a Navi may not teach a new (mid'Oraisa) law through prophecy. (Maharsha - Yehoshua did not give this answer, for he had already learned the laws. They would not be new for him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> One of the forgotten Halachos was a Chatas whose owner died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They asked Pinchas to ask Hash-m. He refused, for "Lo va'Shamayim Hi." (Bach changes this to "Eleh ha'Mitzvos"; according to our text, we can say that he had already learned it.) They asked Elazar to ask Hash-m. He answered "Eleh ha'Mitzvos" - a Navi may not be Mechadesh Halachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Before Moshe departed to Gan Eden, he asked Yehoshua to ask any doubts he had.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Yehoshua:</span> (I have no doubts, for) I never left you, like you wrote in the Torah "u'Mesharaso Yehoshua... Lo Yamish mi'Toch ha'Ohel"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Immediately, Yehoshua's strength waned. He forgot 300 Halachos and had 700 doubts. Bnei Yisrael wanted to kill him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I may not tell the Halachos to you. Go distract Bnei Yisrael by beginning the war - "Acharei Mos Moshe... va'Yomer Hash-m... "</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> During the mourning over Moshe's death, they forgot 1,700 Kal va'Chomerim, Gezeiros Shavos and Dikdukei Sofrim (Halachos that were later quantified, e.g. 13 laws of the Neveilah of a bird of a Tahor species).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Osni'el ben Kenaz restored all of them through his Pilpul - "va'Yilkedah Osni'el ben Kenaz Achi Kalev va'Yiten Lo Es Achsah Bito l'Ishah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She was called Achsah because anyone who looked at her would be Ko'es (get angry) at his wife (Tosfos (Ta'anis 4a) - because of her Tzeni'us).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "... Lish'ol me'Es Aviha Sadeh <i>va'Titznach</i> me'Al ha'Chamor" - what does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> She said, just like a donkey without food screams, also a woman screams if there is no grain in the house.  (I did not find anyone explain how we expound this from "va'Titznach", which means inserting in the ground.<i> </i>Perhaps the Drashah is based on "me'Al". One falls <i>from</i> an animal (e.g. Rivkah - Bereishis 24:64), but one is not inserted from an animal. Therefore, <i>me'Al</i> must mean (that she did something) <i>more than </i>the<i> </i>donkey, i.e. scream - <b>PF</b>.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Tenei Li Berachah Ki Eretz <i>ha'Negev</i> Nosatah Li" - you gave to me a house Menugav (dry) of any good.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"V'Nosatah Li Gulos Mayim" - you gave me a husband who has only Torah (but no money).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Va'Yiten Lah Kalev Es Gulos Aliyos v'Es Gulos Tachtiyos" - ask for food from the One who dwells above and below. (Our text; R. Gershom - I give you a husband to whom all secrets above and below are revealed, and you request food!?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can Osni'el ben Kenaz be "Achi Kalev"? Kalev's father was Yefuneh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Really, Kalev's father was Kenaz. Kalev is called "ben Yefuneh" because he was <i>Pinah</i> (veered from) the counsel of the Meraglim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Kalev's father was Chetzron - "v'Chalev ben Chetzron Holid Es Azuvah"! (Azuvah is Miryam. She is called Azuvah because no one (until Kalev, who was born 48 years after her) wanted to marry her, because she was sick. For marrying her, Kalev is credited with fathering her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Kenaz was Kalev's step-father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Osni'el is Yabetz. His real name was Yehudah, brother of Shimon (Maharsha - we learn from the verses recounting the conquest of Kiryas Sefer);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is called Osni'el because On'o Kel (Hash-m answered him). He is called Yabetz because he was Yo'atz and Hirbitz (counseled and spread) Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Hash-m answered him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Yikra Yabetz... Im Barech Tevarcheni v'Hirbisa Es Gevuli... va'Yavei Elokim Es Asher Sha'al";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Nasan says, "Im Barech Tevarcheni" - in Torah; "v'Hirbisa Es Gevuli" - with Talmidim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"V'Haysah Yadcha Imi" - that I not forget my learning; "v'Asisa me'Ra'ah" - I should have friends like myself; "l'Vilti Atzvi' - the Yetzer ha'Ra should not divert me from learning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If You grant this, good. If not, "Atzvi," I will be sad until death;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Hash-m granted all his requests.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>We find similarly (Rashi - that Hash-m grants requests for Torah; R. Gershom - that one must agree to teach one who asks to learn, just like Hash-m fulfilled Osni'el's request) "Rash v'Ish Techachim Nifgashu Me'ir Einei Sheneihem Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When a Rebbi (who has not yet learned everything) agrees to a Talmid's request to teach him, Hash-m enlightens both of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If the Rebbi refuses, "Ashir va'Rash Nifgashu Oseh Chulam Hash-m". Hash-m had made the Rebbi wise, but now He makes him foolish, and vice-versa for the Talmid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Rebbi says, "Im Barech Tevarcheni" - with children; "v'Hirbisa Es Gevuli" - You will give room for my children;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>"V'Haysah Yadcha Imi" - You will prosper my business; "v'Asisa me'Ra'ah" - I should not have aches of the head, ears and eyes (Maharsha - the source of spiritual pains); "l'Vilti Atzvi' - the Yetzer ha'Ra should not divert me from learning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>If You grant this, good. If not, "Atzvi". Hash-m granted all his requests.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>We find similarly, "Rash v'Ish Techachim... " - if a Ba'al ha'Bayis agrees to a poor person's request to feed him, good. If he refuses, "Ashir va'Rash Nifgashu Oseh Chulam Hash-m" - Hash-m had made the Ba'al ha'Bayis rich, and now He makes him poor, and vice-versa for the poor person.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHATA'OS HA'MESOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> We find that...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> There are five Chata'os ha'Mesos: Vlad Chatas, Temuras Chatas, its owner died, she'Kipru Ba'aleha, and it was not offered within its year;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first three do not apply to the Tzibur (it brings only males, Temurah cannot be made on Korbanos Tzibur, and the Tzibur does not die). The last two do apply to the Tzibur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We did not learn whether or not "Tamus" applies only to Chata'os Yachid, or even to Chata'os Tzibur. We learn the unknown from the explicit;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like we know that for three, "Tamus" applies only to individuals, also for the other two.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we learn the possible from what is impossible?! (It is impossible that Chatas Tzibur must die in the three cases, but it is possible in the other two!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> There was a tradition that four Chata'os must die, and one of them is left to graze (Ro'eh). They forgot which is Ro'eh, so they said that all five must die;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The tradition that four must die could not apply to the Tzibur, for only two cases arise! (We learn the unknown from the explicit. The law (Misah) of the child or Temurah of a Chatas, or a Chatas whose owner died, applies only to individuals. Likewise, the law (Misah) of a Chatas for which a replacement was offered, or that was not offered within one year applies only to individuals!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Nasan):</span> There was a tradition that one Chatas must die, and four are Ro'eh. They forgot which must die, so they said that all five must die. <span class="note">(<span class="notewd">Note:</span> Normally, Amora'im speak in the past tense (Amar), and Tana'im in the present (Omer). However, it is clear that R. Nasan is an Amora arguing with Reish Lakish. Indeed, Tosfos' text reads "R. Nasan <i>Amar</i>" (but most texts say "Omer").)</span></p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> Why did they say that all five must die - they should be stringent only about the category of the one that must die!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is among the three (that do not apply to the Tzibur), why must the other two die?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it is among the two (that apply to the Tzibur), why must the other three die?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They forgot which Chatas must die, they even forgot which category it is in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(We now resume to explain how R. Nasan answers the question, similarly to Reish Lakish.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The tradition that four are Ro'eh could not apply to the Tzibur, for only two cases arise!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Even though (the case which) Tamus (theoretically) could apply to the Tzibur, we learn from the Ro'os, which we know do not apply to the Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>The tradition could not apply to the Tzibur, for there are only two cases that arise (but the tradition says that four are Ro'eh)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>STRINGENCIES OF <i>KODSHIM</i> AND <i>TEMURAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are stringencies of Kodshim (initial Hekdesh) over Temurah, and vice-versa:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The following are stringencies of Kodshim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kodshim make Temurah, but Temurah does not make Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Tzibur and partners can be Makdish, but they cannot make Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Hekdesh of limbs and fetuses takes effect, but they cannot become Kodesh through Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A stringency of Temurah is that Temurah gives Kedushas ha'Guf to a Ba'al Mum Kavu'a. It will never become Chulin to permit shearing it or working with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, Shogeg is like Zevachim regarding Temurah, but not regarding Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Eliezer says, the following animals do not become Kadosh and are not Mekadesh other animals (this will be explained):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tereifah, Kil'ayim, Yotzei Dofen, Tumtum and Androginus.</p>
