<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>HEKDESH ILUY</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We cannot change Kodshei Mizbe'ach or Bedek ha'Bayis from their Kedushah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One can be Makdish (Kodshei Mizbe'ach) for Hekdesh Iluy (his Tovas Hana'ah) or be Macharim them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If they died, they are buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon says, if Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis die, they are redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> If one was Matfis Kodshei Mizbe'ach for Chermei Kohanim, it does not take effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from "Kol Cherem Kodesh Kodashim Hu la'Shem" - every Cherem that was once Kodesh is la'Shem. Kohanim have no share in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one was Matfis Bedek ha'Bayis for Kodshei Mizbe'ach or Chermei Kohanim, it does not take effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one was Matfis Chermei Kohanim for Kodshei Mizbe'ach or Bedek ha'Bayis, it does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If one was Matfis Kodshei Mizbe'ach for Chermei Kohanim, it takes effect! (This is why the Beraisa omitted this case.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for Rav Huna):</span> It did not mention Hatpasah of Kodshei Mizbe'ach, because when one is Matfis them for Bedek ha'Bayis it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Hatpasah of Kodshei Mizbe'ach for Chermei Kohanim does not take effect, the Tana should have taught this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana teaches only things for which neither Hatpasah works.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> One can be Makdish (Kodshei Mizbe'ach) for Hekdesh Iluy or be Macharim them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Hekdesh Iluy is for Bedek ha'Bayis, and Macharim is to Kohanim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, both are for Bedek ha'Bayis. (The Mishnah teaches that) it does not matter whether he said "Hekdesh" or "Cherem".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Beraisa):</span> (In the Mishnah,) Hekdesh Iluy is for Bedek ha'Bayis, and Macharim is to Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Beraisa):</span> If one was Matfis Kodshei Mizbe'ach for Chermei Kohanim, it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Rav Huna is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A verse supports him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> Had the verse said just "Cherem (Kodesh Kodashim Hu la'Shem)", we would expound like Rav Huna;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, it says "<i>Kol</i> Cherem", to teach that Chermei Kohanim take effect on all Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>HATPASAH</i> FOR <i>BEDEK HA'BAYIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ula contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If one was Matfis an Olah for Bedek ha'Bayis, Bedek ha'Bayis does not receive anything, just it is not offered until the Gizbar is there. (One should oversee Hakravah of his Korban.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mid'Rabanan, Chermei Kohanim take effect on all Kodshim. The verse teaches that Me'ilah applies to Chermei Kohanim (before they are given to a Kohen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need a verse? Chermei Kohanim are called Kodshei Kodashim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> R. Yanai taught that the Torah explicitly teaches about Me'ilah only in an Olah - "Nefel Ki Sim'ol... mi'Kodshei Hash-m" discusses matters that are only for Hash-m;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn about Chatas and Asham (which Kohanim eat) from Rebbi's teaching;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "Kol Chelev la'Shem" includes Chelev of Kodshim Kalim. Me'ilah applies to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need a verse? They are called Kodshei Kodashim!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though they are called Kodshei Kodashim, we need a verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Similarly, even though Chermei Kohanim are called Kodshei Kodashim, we need a verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If one was Matfis an Olah for Bedek ha'Bayis, Bedek ha'Bayis does not receive anything, just it is not offered until the Gizbar is there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one was Matfis an Olah for Bedek ha'Bayis, one may not slaughter it before redeeming it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is mid'Rabanan. (Mid'Oraisa, nothing took effect.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> If one slaughtered it, it is Kosher. (If mid'Oraisa it became Kodesh, it would be Pasul. The Griz asks why this is so.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> (If one benefits from it) he transgresses Me'ilah twice. (Tosfos - since mid'Oraisa it is Hekdesh, people are careful not to benefit from it. Chachamim would not need to enact a second Me'ilah mid'Rabanan!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that if the Hatpasah would work mid'Oraisa, he would transgress Me'ilah twice.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>HA'AMADAH V'HA'ARACHAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they died, they are buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Chachamim require Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah (to stand up the Hekdesh and evaluate it for redemption) for both Bedek ha'Bayis and Kodshei Mizbe'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> They require it only for Bedek ha'Bayis, but not for Kodshei Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish agree that R. Shimon requires it only for Kodshei Mizbe'ach, but not for Bedek ha'Bayis;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>All agree that a Ba'al Mum me'Ikaro (it was blemished before it was Hukdash) does not need Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis die, they are redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this according to R. Yochanan. Because Chachamim require Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah for both kinds of Hekdesh, R. Shimon had to specify that Bedek ha'Bayis does not require it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Reish Lakish, Chachamim discussed only Bedek ha'Bayis. R. Shimon should have said only "if they die, they are redeemed"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> R. Shimon did not understand Chachamim. (He assumed that they discuss both);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He says, regarding Kodshei Mizbe'ach, I agree (that Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah is required);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding Bedek ha'Bayis, (I disagree;) if they died, they are redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> R. Shimon did not know what Chachamim discuss;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He says, if you discuss Kodshei Mizbe'ach, I agree (that Ha'amadah v'Ha'arachah is required);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If you discuss Bedek ha'Bayis, (I disagree;) if they died, they are redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> "V'Im Kol <i>Behemah Teme'ah</i> Asher Lo Yakrivu Mimenu Korban la'Shem" refers to a Ba'al Mum that was redeemed. (We adopt the text of Shitah Mekubetzes. It is like the Gemara in Bechoros.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it truly refers to a Tamei (species of) Behemah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Im ba'Behemah ha'Teme'ah u'Fadah v'Erkecha" discusses Teme'im, so "v'Im Kol Behemah Teme'ah" must refer to a Ba'al Mum that was redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a Korban may be redeemed if it has a Mum Over (a temporary Mum)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher Lo Yakrivu Mimenu Korban la'Shem" refers to something that can never be offered. This excludes a Ba'al Mum Over, for it may be offered later.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> It refers to Kodshei Mizbe'ach, and it requires Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah!</p>
