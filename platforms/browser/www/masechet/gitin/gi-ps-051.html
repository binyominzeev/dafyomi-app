<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT MAY BE COLLECTED FROM <i>MESHUBADIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Chanina also require that the debt be written (to be collected from Meshubadim), or is it sufficient that it has a limit?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can learn from the following. A case occurred in which a man died and left two daughters and a son. The first daughter took Parnasah (a 10th of the estate for a dowry). The son died before the second took Parnasah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The second daughter forfeits her claim to Parnasah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanina):</span> Parnasah may be collected from Meshubadim, unlike food for the daughters. How can you say that she does not receive Parnasah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Parnasah is limited, but it is not written, and R. Chanina says that it may be collected from Meshubadim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> People hear about Parnasah, therefore it is as if it is written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna bar Mano'ach - Mishnah):</span> (When Leah married Reuven, she stipulated that he feed her daughter Dinah (from a previous marriage) for five years; she made the same Tanai when she married David). If Reuven and David died, their own daughters are fed from Bnei Chorin (of their fathers). Dinah is fed from even Meshubadim, for she is like a creditor (even though the debt was not written)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, formal acquisitions were made to obligate Reuven and David. (Rashi - presumably, these were written; Tosfos - this is as good as being written.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, acquisitions should also enable their own daughters to eat from Meshubadim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, acquisitions were only made for Dinah, not for their own daughters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Tana pick such a case, that acquisitions were made only for Dinah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Dinah was alive when Leah got married, so an acquisition helps for her. The husbands' own daughters were not alive at the time, so acquisitions would not help for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why must we say that the husbands' daughter were not yet alive? Perhaps they were previously married to Leah, and have daughters from the previous marriage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, since a Tanai of Beis Din (the enactment of Kesuvah) obligates feeding their own daughters, an acquisition does not help for them. There is no Tanai of Beis Din for Dinah, so an acquisition helps for her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why should a Tanai of Beis Din weaken the power of acquisition for the daughters?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather since a Tanai of Beis Din obligates feeding their own daughters, we do not allow them to take Meshubadim, because we are concerned lest their fathers left money for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> When do we say that consumed Peros and improvements to stolen land may not be collected from Meshubadim? This is when the land was bought before the Peros and improvements;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Peros and improvements came first, they may be collected from land sold later! (Rashi - they are neither written nor limited. We challenge all the Amora'im! Tosfos - they are only limited, but not written. We challenge Ula, and show that R. Chanina must hold that it suffices to be limited.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not collect consumed Peros, improvements to stolen land, or food for the widow and daughters from Meshubadim, because they are not written. This is an enactment for Tikun ha'Olam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, even without an enactment we do not collect these from Meshubadim, for they are unlimited! (Rashi; Tosfos - the enactment for Tikun ha'Olam is not because they are not written, rather, because they are unlimited!)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES ONE WHO FINDS AN <i>AVEIDAH</i> SWEAR?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who finds an Aveidah does not swear...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> If Reuven claims that he lost two wallets tied together, and that Shimon found them, and Shimon says that he only found one , Shimon must swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven claims that he lost two oxen tied together and that Shimon found them, and Shimon says that he only found one , Shimon need not swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the cases?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Wallets do not come untied by themselves, but oxen do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (R. Yitzchak):</span> If Reuven claims that he lost two oxen tied together and that Shimon found them, and Shimon admits to finding them, but claims that he returned one of them, Shimon must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Support (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven claims that he lost two oxen tied together and that Shimon found them, and Shimon says that he only found one , Shimon need not swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven claims that he lost two wallets tied together and that Shimon found them, and Shimon says that he only found one , Shimon must swear. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Doesn't R. Yitzchak agree that an enactment for Tikun ha'Olam exempts the finder of an Aveidah from swearing?!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">51b----------------------------------------51b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yitzchak holds like R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> Sometimes one swears due to his own claim. If Reuven says 'Shimon's father deposited one Maneh by me, and I returned half', he must swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he is like one who returns an Aveidah; he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Doesn't R. Eliezer ben Yakov exempt one who returns an Aveidah? (Surely he is believed, Migo (since) he could have denied finding anything!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The case is, Shimon, a minor, claims that Reuven owes the full Maneh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The claim of a minor means nothing!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not swear to counter the claim of a deaf person, lunatic or minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav meant, Shimon is an adult, but in his father's affairs he is (ignorant) like a minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does R. Eliezer ben Yakov say that Reuven swears due to his own claim? He swears due to Shimon's claim!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is Shimon's claim, but Reuven's admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Every case of the oath (of Modeh b'Miktzas) is due to his own (partial) admission!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Answer #2 (to Question k:1):</span> Really, Shimon is a minor. R. Eliezer ben Yakov and Chachamim argue about Rabah's teaching);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Answer #2 (to Question k:2:i):</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov says that Reuven swears due to what Chachamim call Reuven's own claim. They argue about Rabah's teaching);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> The Torah required one who makes a partial admission to swear, because one is not brazen enough to lie and deny his creditor's claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Really, he would like to deny the whole claim, but he lacks the audacity to do so to his creditor.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Since he lacks the audacity, he would prefer to admit to the entire claim. He is not doing this, because he cannot pay the whole claim now. He is stalling until he can pay it all.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>The Torah imposes an oath on him so he will admit to the whole claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says that likewise, one cannot be brazen to deny the claim of his creditor's son. Therefore, he is not like one who returns an Aveidah. (Rather, he must swear.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Chachamim say that one cannot be brazen to deny his creditor's claim, but he can be brazen against his creditor's son;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since he could have denied the whole claim, but did not, he is like one who returns an Aveidah (and need not swear).</p>
