<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she was standing on the roof and he threw a Get to her, once it reaches the airspace above the roof, she is divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he was on the roof and she was below, and he threw a Get to her, once it leaves the airspace of the roof, even if it was blotted out or burned in mid-air, she is divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is she divorced? The roof is not guarded! (The wind can blow the Get away, so the roof cannot acquire for her!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The case is, there is a railing around the roof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula bar Manshiya):</span> The case is, the Get passed less than three Tefachim above the roof.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anything less than three Tefachim above the roof is like (resting on) the roof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he was on the roof...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is she divorced? The yard (in which she stands) is not guarded (the wind can blow the Get outside)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah, R. Elazar, Ula, and R. Asi):</span> The case is, the walls around the yard (in which she stands) are higher than the roof (so once the Get leaves the roof, it is guarded).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba, also R. Zeira):</span> Is this only according to Rebbi, who says (regarding Shabbos) that something in mid-air is considered as resting?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula, also R. Asi):</span> No, it is even like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue only about Shabbos. Gitin depends on the Get being guarded, and here the Get is guarded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it was blotted out...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> This applies only if it was blotted out while descending. If it was blotted out while ascending, she is not divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> While ascending, it is not considered destined to land (we cannot view it as if it already landed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it burned up...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> This is only if he threw the Get before there was a fire. If the fire came first, she is not divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the moment he threw it, it was destined to be burned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>RECEIVING A <i>GET</i> THROUGH PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a man lent property to his wife to receive her Get, he lent to her only one property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> What is Rav Chisda's source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If she was standing on the roof and he threw a Get to her, once it reaches the airspace above the roof, she is divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she owns the yard and the roof, she is divorced even before it enters the airspace of the roof!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he owns the yard and the roof, even after it enters the airspace of the roof, she is not divorced!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We must say that he owns the yard, and she owns the roof.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Reisha):</span> If he was on the roof and she was below, and he threw a Get to her, once it leaves the airspace of the roof, even if it was blotted out or burned in mid-air, she is divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If also here, he owns the yard and she owns the roof, why is she divorced?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We must say that here she owns the yard, and he owns the roof.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is unreasonable. The Mishnah should be consistent!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to both questions):</span> Rather, in the entire Mishnah he owns both, and he lends to her a place to receive the Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Mishnah says that she is not divorced until the Get enters the airspace of where she is. This teaches that he lent to her only that place, for a man lends only one place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The objection to Answer #1 is unfounded. We can say that in the Reisha, he owns the yard and she owns the roof. In the Seifa, she owns the yard and he owns the roof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> There are three laws about receiving a Get through property:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi considers an airborne object to be resting and Chachamim argue. That is only regarding Shabbos, but here all agree that she acquires the Get (in midair), because it is guarded.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Chisda taught that if one erects a beam in a Reshus ha'Yachid (private domain) with a basket on top, even if it is 100 Amos tall, one who throws something into it from Reshus ha'Rabim (a public thoroughfare) is liable, for Reshus ha'Yachid extends to the sky.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>That is only regarding Shabbos. A Get is not acquired this way, for a Get must be guarded, and this is not considered guarded.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">79b----------------------------------------79b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Yehudah taught that one may not stand on a roof and collect rainwater from another roof (even if they are attached), for just like the houses below are distinct residences, the roofs are considered distinct. (One may not transfer from one Reshus ha'Yachid to a different Reshus ha'Yachid on Shabbos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>That is only regarding Shabbos. Gitin depend on the will of the husband (who lent to his wife the roof to receive the Get). A man is not so particular about on which roof she receives the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If a woman owns an inner yard, and her husband owns an outer yard, and the walls of the outer are higher than those of the inner, and he threw a Get to her, once it (is above her Chatzer) and is lower than the outer walls, she is divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is she divorced? The Get is not guarded within the walls of her property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The outer walls also service the inner Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This does not apply to boxes. If she owns an inner box, and he owns the outer box, and throws a Get, even after it in the airspace of her box, she is not divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It has not rested yet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even after it rests, why is she divorced? This is like the Kli of the buyer in the domain of the seller!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, his box has no bottom. (Her box rests on the ground.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AN OLD <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> A man may divorce his wife with an old Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel forbid this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Get is old if the couple were secluded after the Get was written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Shamai hold that we do not decree lest she became pregnant after the writing, and people will assume that the Get was given on the date written and say that the child was conceived after the divorce. Beis Hillel make this decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Aba):</span> If she remarried relying on an old Get, she may remain married.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Aba):</span> If she was divorced with an old Get, she may remarry l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FINES FOR REMARRYING WITH AN IMPROPER <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman remarried relying on a Get with one of the problems listed below, she suffers the following penalties:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She may not remain married to her original nor her new husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She may not marry anyone else until she gets a proper Get from both husbands;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">She does not receive from either husband:</span> a Kesuvah, Peros (the yield of her property), food, or the remnants of (Rashi; Tosfos - compensation for depreciation of) property that she brought into the marriage;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she took, she must return it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Children from either husband (after she remarried) are Mamzerim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If she dies, neither husband may become Tamei (if he is a Kohen) to engage in her burial;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Neither husband receives objects she finds or her productivity;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Neither can annul her vows;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>If she is a Bas Yisrael, she is permanently disqualified from marrying a Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>If she is a Bas Levi, she is disqualified from eating Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>If she is a Bas Kohen, she is disqualified from eating Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>Her children from either husband do not inherit her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span>If either husband died before giving her a Get, she does Chalitzah with his brother, but not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The problematic Gitin are:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The date is not according to the reign of the king of the land, rather according to the king of an improper kingdom, or of the Medes, or of the Yevanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The year was counted from the building of the Beis ha'Mikdash or its destruction;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He was in the east, but the Get says 'in the west';</p>
