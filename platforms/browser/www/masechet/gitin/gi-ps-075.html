<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man gave a Get and said 'the Get is yours but the paper is mine', she is not divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'on condition that you return the paper to me', she is divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the two clauses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> The Beraisa is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel, who says that she may give money in place of the garment. Here also, she can appease him with money in place of returning the Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel said only that she may give money in place of the garment when the garment is lost. Here, the Get is around, so we have no source to say that she can give money in its stead!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Rather, the Beraisa is like R. Meir, who says that a Tanai (stipulation) is invalid unless doubled (if this, then...; if not, then...)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, he said only 'you are divorced if you return the Get.' He did not double the Tanai (and say 'you are not divorced if you don't return it'), so the Get works unconditionally.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> You imply that had he doubled the Tanai, (the condition would be valid and) the Get would be void. We learn about Tanayim from Moshe's Tanai with the Shevatim of Reuven and Gad!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There, the Tanai (if they will fight valorously) precedes the result (they will inherit in Gil'ad). Here, the result (divorce) preceded the Tanai (returning the Get). Even had he doubled it, the Tanai would be invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> The Get is valid because the result preceded the Tanai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> You imply that had he mentioned the Tanai before the divorce, the Tanai would be valid and) the Get would be void. We learn Tanayim from the Tanai with Bnei Gad and Bnei Reuven!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There, the Tanai (fighting) and the result (inheritance) are unrelated. Here, the Tanai (returning the Get) and the result (the divorce) are contradictory (Tosfos)!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">75b----------------------------------------75b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The Get is valid because the Tanai and the result contradict each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah is like Rebbi, who says that saying 'on condition that' is like saying 'from now' (so there is no contradiction between the Tanai and the result).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Shmuel enacted that a Shechiv Mera who gives a Get should say 'if I do not die (from this illness), the Get is Pasul. If I die, the Get is valid.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not say 'if I die, the Get is valid. If I do not die, the Get is Pasul'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One does not begin with something to his detriment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not say 'the Get is Pasul if I do not die?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tanai must precede the result.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> We learn conditions from the Tanai with the tribes of Reuven and Gad!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There, the positive (if they will fight) precedes the negative (if they will not fight). Every Tanai must be like this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In Shmuel's text, the negative comes first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, he should say 'if I do not die, the Get is Pasul. If I die, the Get is valid. If I do not die, it is Pasul,'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His initial words (if I do not die) are favorable. The positive Tanai (if I die) precedes the (repetition of) the negative.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>TANAYIM</i> FOR DURATIONS OF TIME</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'this is your Get on condition that you serve my father, or that you nurse my son'...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long is the period of nursing?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is two years;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> It is 18 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the son or the father dies, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he said 'this is your Get on condition that you serve my father for two years', or 'that you nurse my son for two years', if the son dies or the father says that he does not want her to serve him, even if she did nothing to upset him, the Get is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, such a Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The rule is, whenever she does not inhibit fulfillment of the Tanai, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Must she really nurse for two years?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If she served the father or nursed for one day, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel (who said about a Tanai to return a garment that he seeks his own benefit. Here also, he wants her to nurse as long as is needed). The Beraisa is like Chachamim (who say that he intends to pain her, so one day suffices).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel is mentioned only in the Seifa. This implies that the Reisha is not R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Beraisa is like R. Shimon, who is lenient about conditions. Our Mishnah is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> In the Mishnah, he did not specify for how long she must nurse. In the Beraisa, he specified one day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> Not specifying is like specifying one day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The period of nursing is two years. R. Yehudah says, it is 18 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rava, this is how long she must nurse when he did not specify.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Ashi, one day should suffice!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches that the day must be within the first two years (or 18 months) of the son's life.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If he divorced 'on condition that you serve my father for two years' or 'that you nurse my son for two years', if the son dies or the father does not want her to serve him, even if she did nothing to upset him, the Get is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, according to Rava, in the Reisha he did not specify the time, and in the Seifa he did.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Rav Ashi, what is the difference between the clauses? (Rashi - in both, we must say that the son died before she nursed the required time; Tosfos - also in the Reisha, when he did not specify a time, it is as if he specified!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is left difficult.</p>
