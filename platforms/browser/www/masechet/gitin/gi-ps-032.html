<p class="dedicationbox">GITIN 32 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS ONE WHO CANCELS A <i>GET</i> SINCERE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven appointed Shimon to give a Get to Reuven's wife, and Reuven found Shimon and told him that the Get is void, or Reuven sent Ploni to tell this to Shimon, the Get is void;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven told his wife, himself or via a Shali'ach, that the Get is void, it is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she already received the Get, Reuven cannot invalidate it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>At first, a man who wanted to invalidate a Get would assemble a Beis Din and tell them that it is void. R. Gamliel enacted not to do so, for Tikun ha'Olam (for the betterment of the world).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Mishnah does not say that Reuven caught up to Shimon, rather, he chanced upon him. Still, we say that the Get is Pasul; Reuven did not say this merely to pain his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Mishnah also teach about when Reuven sent Ploni to tell Shimon that the Get is void?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the second Shali'ach (to invalidate the Get) is no stronger than the first Shali'ach, and the Get remains valid. We hear, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Mishnah teach about when Reuven told his wife before she received it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that only when he tells Shimon, then we say that the Get is truly void, but when he tells his wife, surely he intends only to pain her, not to invalidate it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We hear, this is not so (in either case it is void).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Mishnah teach about when Reuven sent a Shali'ach tell his wife?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Reuven himself would not toil to find his wife and tell her, just to pain her; but he is not concerned for the exertion of a Shali'ach, and would send a Shali'ach just to pain her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. (In either case it is void.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she already received the Get, Reuven cannot invalidate it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, we know that he was pursuing Shimon to invalidate it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that this reveals that retroactively, the Get is void. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>EXPRESSIONS OF CANCELLING A <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven said 'it is Batel (void)' or 'I do not want it', his words take effect (he invalidates it). If he said 'it is Pasul (invalid)' or 'it is not a Get', his words have no effect. (This connotes it was already Pasul; this is false.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> 'It is Batel' means that he invalidates it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah bar Avuha taught that if one received a gift and then said 'the gift is Mevuteles (voided)' or 'it should be void' or 'I do not want it', his words do not take effect. If he said 'it is Beteilah (void)' or 'it is not a gift', his words take effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that 'Batel' implies that it was void from the beginning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> 'Batel' can connote from the beginning, or it should be void.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding a Get, he means the latter, for this works (to stop the divorce). Regarding a gift, he means the former, for that works (to undo the gift).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> A Shali'ach to give a gift is like a Shali'ach to give a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This teaches that if the sender says 'Holech (bring)', he does not mean that the Shali'ach should acquire on behalf of the recipient.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If the husband says only 'Batel' (without 'it is'), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes, or a Beraisa):</span> If one said 'this Get will not work', or 'it will not permit/abandon/send/or divorce', or 'it should be a shard' or 'like a shard (i.e. worthless)', he words take effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If he said 'this Get does not work', 'it does not permit/abandon/send/or divorce', or 'it is a shard/like a shard', his words do not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he said 'behold, it is a shard', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> This is like 'behold, this is Hekdesh or Hefker' (now he makes it Hefker or Hekdesh. Similarly, now he makes the Get like a shard, and this takes effect.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HOW DOES <i>BITUL</i> WORK?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Reuven appointed Shimon to give a Get, and cancelled it, can Reuven later use the Get?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Yes, he can.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> He cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Halachah follows Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan said that if a woman accepted Kidushin to take effect after 30 days, she can retract. The Halachah follows R. Yochanan! (Here also, the Get should become void!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, her initial acceptance was mere words, so her latter words nullify her initial words;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, the husband nullifies the appointment of the Shali'ach. A Get itself (which is more than mere words) does not become void!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> At first, a man would assemble a Beis Din (to nullify a Get).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In front of how many men must he nullify it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> It must be in front of (at least) two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> It must be in front of three.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Sheshes says three, because the Mishnah says that he would assemble a Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Nachman holds that two people are also considered a Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> 'I hand over (my loans) to you judges, Ploni and Ploni (the judges on a Beis Din for Pruzbul)'.</p>
