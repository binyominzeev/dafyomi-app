<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN DO <i>TANAYIM</i> DISQUALIFY A <i>GET</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (R. Zeira):</span> Rebbi and Chachamim argue about a Tanai before the Toref. Rebbi decrees to disqualify 'on condition that' due to 'except'. Chachamim do not decree;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>All agree that Tanayim after the Toref do not disqualify the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(The Seifa of) our Mishnah says that only written Tanayim disqualify. We established the Mishnah to be when he said 'except';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah can discuss before the Toref, and it is like Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, it can discuss after the Toref, and all agree to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Rava):</span> Rebbi and Chachamim argue when the Tanai is after the Toref. Rebbi decrees to disqualify it due to a Tanai before the Toref. Chachamim do not decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>All agree that Tanayim before the Toref disqualify a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Our Mishnah says that only written Tanayim disqualify, and only when he said 'except', but not if he said 'on condition that';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah discusses after the Toref. It is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin's father - Beraisa):</span> All agree that if a Get was written on Tanai, it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> They argue in this case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction (R. Zeira):</span> The proper text of the Beraisa must say that all agree that it is valid, when the Tanai was after the Toref.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rather than changing the text of the Beraisa, R. Zeira should have said that it is like Rebbi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is reasonable that R. Avin's father mixed up 'valid' and 'Pasul', but he would not confuse 'all agree' with 'this is (Rebbi's opinion).'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MEN TO WHOM SHE IS FORBIDDEN ANYWAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'you are permitted to every man except for my father', or he excluded his brother, her father or brother, a slave or Nochri, or anyone to whom she cannot be Mekudeshes, the Get is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he excluded a Kohen Gadol (even if she is a widow), or a regular Kohen (and she was divorced or a Chalutzah), or a Yisrael (and she is a Mamzeres or Nesinah), or a Mamzer or Nasin (and she is a Bas Yisrael), or anyone to whom she can be Mekudeshes (even if it is forbidden), the Get is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does the rule of the Reisha (or anyone to whom she cannot be Mekudeshes) come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes other relatives punishable by Kares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does the rule of the Seifa (or anyone to whom she can be Mekudeshes) include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes other men forbidden by a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If he said 'except for Reuven (and he is a minor)', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we consider him like one who cannot be Mekadesh her (i.e. now)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is he like one who can be Mekadesh her (i.e. later)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> A minor can be divorced even from a mid'Oraisa marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Yotzah v'Haysah" equates divorce and Kidushin. A girl who cannot be Mekudeshes (e.g. a minor not in her father's Reshus, e.g. after Nisu'in) cannot be divorced!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A minor is like one who can be Mekudeshes, because she can be Mekudeshes when she matures. <span class="note">(<span class="notewd">Note:</span> the Gemara did not even challenge Rav Nachman from a Mishnah (55a) that says that a Chereshes (deaf woman) can be divorced (even if she was married mid'Oraisa through her father), even though she can never be Mekudeshes again! Perhaps it is understood that any minor can be divorced, even if she is Goses or Tereifah, and barring an unlikely or miraculous cure, she will never live to adulthood and the possibility of Kidushin. Similarly, a Chereshes can be divorced, even though she will have Da'as and potential for Kidushin only if she gets an unexpected cure.)</span></p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Here also, a minor is considered one to whom she can be Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one said 'except for men who will be born', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since they are not around yet, the Get is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since they will be born, the Get is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> If he said '(except for) a slave or Nochri', even though they may convert (or be freed), the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is different, for we do not expect them to convert. Men are destined to be born!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If he said 'except for your sister's husband', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Now, she cannot be Mekudeshes to him, so the Get is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since she will be permitted to him if her sister dies, the Get is Pasul?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> If he said '(except for) a slave or Nochri', even though they may convert (or be freed), the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is different, for conversion is uncommon, but death is common.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If he said 'you are divorced except regarding Bi'as Zenus', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding marriage, he permitted her to everyone (so the Get is valid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he did not permit (all) Bi'ah, it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> If he said 'except for my father or your father'...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding what did he not permit them?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We cannot say that it is regarding marriage. She cannot be married to them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is regarding Bi'as Zenus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Only regarding her father or father-in-law, such a Get is valid. If he did not permit Bi'as Zenus with other men, the Get would be Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, it refers to marriage, if she should transgress and 'marry' either of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he said 'except for Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah (in the anus)', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Normal Bi'ah is fully permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since the Torah equates normal Bi'ah and Lo k'Darkah, a Get must permit both!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER REMNANTS OF MARRIAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he said 'except for vows (I can annul your vows even after I divorce you)', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He permits her to marry anyone;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, "her husband will affirm her vows, and her husband will annul her vows" shows that he is still called her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If (Tosfos - he is a Kohen, and) he said 'except for Terumah (you may still eat Terumah after I divorce you)', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He permits her to marry anyone;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, "the acquisition of his money (may eat Terumah)" shows that she is still called his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he said 'except for my privilege to inherit you if you die', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He permits her to marry anyone;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, "he will inherit her, his close kin" shows that he is still considered her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he said 'except for Kidushin through a document', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She can be Mekudeshes through money or Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since all methods of Kidushin are equated, a Get must permit all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>These questions are unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE ESSENTIAL PART OF A <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The essential part of a Get is 'you are permitted to every man';</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">85b----------------------------------------85b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, it is 'and this will be for you, from me, a Sefer of cutting, a letter of abandonment, a Get of exemption that permits you to marry any man you want.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The essential part of a Get of freedom is 'you are a free woman', or 'you are to yourself.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Obviously, if a Get of divorce says 'you are a free woman', or a Get of freedom says 'you are permitted to every man', it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Get of divorce says 'you are to yourself', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he mean 'you are entirely to yourself'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does he refer only to work?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> The essential part of a Get of freedom is 'you are a free woman', or 'you are to yourself,'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A master owns his slave's body, still 'you are to yourself' suffices for the slave to acquire himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A husband does not own his wife's body. All the more so, this expression suffices!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If a Get of freedom says 'I have no involvement in you', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chanin - Beraisa):</span> If one sold his slave to a Nochri, the slave goes free, and needs a Get of freedom from his original owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if he wrote his Ono, this serves like his Get of freedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is an Ono?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> It says 'when you flee from him (your new master) I have no involvement in you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> It is 'and this will be for you, from me, a Sefer of cutting, a letter of abandonment, a Get of exemption that permits you to marry any man you want.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do R. Yehudah and Chachamim argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim hold that a Yad (an abbreviated expression) that is not clear (how to complete it) is a valid Yad (it is as if he said the full expression);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though he did not write 'and this...', it is clear that he divorces her through the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Yehudah holds that an ambiguous Yad is not a Yad;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he does not write 'and this...', perhaps he divorces her verbally, and the Get is just for a proof.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WORDS THAT COULD BE MISCONSTRUED IN A <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One should not write in a Get 'v'Dein' (and this is) with a 'Yud', lest this be read 'v'Din' (the law obligates me to divorce you). Rather, it should be written without a 'Yud'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One should not write 'Igeres (a letter)' with a 'Yud', lest this be understood like Igra (a roof). Rather, it should be written without a 'Yud'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One should not write 'Limehach (it will be) with a 'Yud', lest this be read 'Li Mihach' (the Get will be to me). One should beware lest (the Hei look like a Ches, and) the word look like 'Limchach' (for a joke).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>'D'Yisyehaviyein' and 'D'Yisyatzviyein' should each be written with three 'Yud'im' (to connote 'that you will marry' and 'that you will want').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One should elongate the Vov in 'Tiruchin (cutting)' and 'Shevukin (abandonment). If the Vov would be mistaken for a 'Yud', this would refer to Gitin in general (not specifically for his wife).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>One should elongate the Vov in 'd'Chado (that when).' If it would look like a 'Yud', this would imply that he divorces her 'Kedi' (without anything, i.e. without a Get).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>One should not write 'Le'isnasva' lest it be read 'Lo Yisnasva' (not to marry), rather, 'Lehisnasva'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must one write 'and this...'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava enacted that a Get should say 'Ploni... cuts off Plonis... from this day and forever.' He did not mention 'and this...'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He did not mention other things that must be in the Get. Likewise, he did not mention 'and this...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rava enacted that the Get should say 'from this day.' This is unlike R. Yosi, who says that the date on a document itself proves that it takes effect that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>He enacted 'forever', lest people think that the divorce was only temporary.</p>
