<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS FREEDOM GOOD FOR A SLAVE? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir explained only why it is disadvantageous for a Kohen's slave to go free. What will he say about a Yisrael's slave?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> Freedom forbids him to a female slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To the contrary, he benefits. He becomes permitted to a Bas Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A slave prefers loose, immodest, unrestricted Bi'ah with a female slave.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN ONE CAN RETRACT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said 'give this Get of divorce (or freedom) to my wife (or slave)', and Reuven died, we do not give it posthumously;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'give 100 Zuz to Ploni', and Reuven died, we give it posthumously.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yitzchak bar Shmuel, citing Rav):</span> We give the money only if it is piled up in a corner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If Reuven is healthy, why does it matter if the money is gathered? Meshichah (taking it to the recipient's premises to acquire it) was not done!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Reuven is a Shechiv Mera.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the money be piled up? It is as if the words of a Shechiv Mera were written and handed over!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zevid):</span> Really, he is healthy. This is like another teaching of Rav:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Levi says to Yehudah 'you have money of mine. Give it to David', and all three are present, David acquires the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Really, Reuven is a Shechiv Mera. This is like a different teaching of Rav:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a Shechiv Mera said 'give 100 Zuz of my property to Ploni':</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he said 'this 100 Zuz", we give it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he did not specify which money, we do not give. Perhaps he referred to a deposit of Ploni that is buried somewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Halachah is, we are not concerned lest he referred to buried money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav Papa explain like Rav Zevid?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He understands that Rav's law applies both to a loan and to a deposit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav Zevid learn like Rav Papa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot establish the Mishnah to discuss a Shechiv Mera.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says that if Reuven said 'give this Get of divorce (or freedom) to my wife (or slave)', and Reuven died, we do not give it posthumously;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had Reuven not died, we would give them. This is only because Reuven said 'give'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding a Shechiv Mera, even if he did not say 'give', we give them!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> At first, they said that if a man being led to his execution said 'write a Get to my wife', we write it and give it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Later, they added, even a man departing on a sea voyage or with a caravan;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Shimon Shezuri says, this applies even to a Shechiv Mera.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Why did Rav Zevid assume that the Mishnah is like R. Shimon Shezuri? Perhaps it is like Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MA'AMAD SHELOSHTAM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Levi says to Yehudah 'you have money of mine. Give it to David', and all three are present, David acquires the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Presumably, Rav's law applies only to a deposit (because he could give it over), but not to a loan. However, Rav actually said it even about a loan!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If Levi says to Yehudah 'you borrowed money from me. Give it to David', and all three are present, Yehudah owes the money to David.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does this work?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ameimar):</span> It is as if Yehudah said when he borrowed the money 'I am indebted to you, or anyone who will come in your stead.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> If so, it should not be possible to give the loan to someone who was not born at the time the loan was given!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even R. Meir, who says that one can transfer ownership of something that did not come to the world, allows transferring only to someone in the world!</p>
