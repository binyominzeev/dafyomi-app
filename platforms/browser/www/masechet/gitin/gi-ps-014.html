<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Rather, through the benefit of converting an old loan into a new loan, Yehudah is able to obligate himself to David.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Huna, son of Rav Nechemyah):</span> If so, Rav's law would not apply if David were like people of Bar Elyashiv's house, who force one to pay immediately! (Transferring a loan to such people is not beneficial.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps indeed, that is true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the law would vary according to the recipient (and this is unreasonable)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mar Zutra):</span> Rather, Rav's law is one of three enactments without reason (how they work). The others are:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a man wrote a document giving all his property to his wife, he made her only an overseer on the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chinena):</span> If a man marries off his oldest son in a house, the son acquires the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav (to Rav Acha Bardela):</span> I deposited saffron by you. Give it to Ploni. I am telling you in front of him; I will not retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that he could retract if he wanted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Rather, he said 'I cannot retract.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rav need to say this? He already taught the law of Ma'amad Sheloshtam!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that only a large gift requires that all three are present, but one can transfer a small gift even if the recipient is not there. Rav teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Some gardeners (who worked together) calculated among themselves that one of them (Reuven) had five half-Zuz too much. They told him, in front of the owner of the land, to give it to the owner of the land. They made an acquisition.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven later calculated by himself, and saw that he did not have too much.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> You cannot retract! Rav's law obligates you. Also, they made an acquisition!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> He is not simply refusing to pay. He says that he erred!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> I did not realize that this was the case. Any mistaken acquisition is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES A <i>SHALI'ACH</i> ACQUIRE ON BEHALF OF THE RECIPIENT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Reuven said 'Holech (take) 100 Zuz to Ploni, that I owe him', and the money never reached Ploni, Reuven still owes him. He cannot retract and tell the Shali'ach 'give me back the money';</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Since Reuven must pay if the money never reaches Ploni, he can tell the Shali'ach 'give me back the money.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about whether or not saying 'take' is like saying 'Zechi (acquire for).' (Rav holds that it is, therefore Reuven cannot retract.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> No, all agree that it is like saying 'Zechi'. They argue about whether or not we apply the principal 'Migo' (since if the money never reaches Ploni, Reuven must pay, he can tell the Shali'ach 'give me back the money'. Only Shmuel applies Migo.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven said 'take 100 Zuz to Ploni, that I owe him' or 'that he deposited with me', or 'give (the loan or deposit of) 100 Zuz...', and the money never reached Ploni, Reuven still owes him. He cannot tell the Shali'ach 'give me back the money.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the case of a deposit, one does not want his money to be in the hands of someone he did not entrust with it. (Therefore, the Shali'ach does not acquire the money for Ploni. Reuven should be able to retract!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> The case is, Reuven has a history of denying deposits. (Surely, Ploni wants the deposit to pass to someone else's hands!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Some people in Mechuza owed Rav Sheshes for coats he had given them. He asked Rav Yosef bar Chama to bring the money when he came from there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The people gave the money to Rav Yosef. They asked him to make an acquisition to accept Acharayus (to bear the loss if the money will not reach Rav Sheshes, and they will be exempt). He agreed, but evaded them and never made the acquisition.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rav Sheshes:</span> You acted properly, not to fulfill upon yourself "the borrower is a slave to the lender."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Sheshes:</span> You acted properly. "The borrower is a slave to the lender" (so they have Acharayus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav Acha b'Rebbi Yoshiyah had a silver flask in Neharde'a. He asked R. Dostai b'Rebbi Yanai and R. Yosi bar Kipar to bring it when they came.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The one's watching the flask gave it to them, and asked them to make an acquisition to accept Acharayus. They refused. The watchers asked them to return the flask. R. Dostai agreed, but R. Yosi refused.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They afflicted R. Yosi. They said to R. Dostai 'see how stubborn he is!" He replied 'it is good that you hit him.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">When they returned, R. Yosi complained:</span> not only he didn't help me, but he even said 'it is good that you hit him'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Acha:</span> Why did you act this way?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Dostai:</span> Those people are dangerous! If they say 'tie him up', they (others) tie the person up! If they say 'kill', they 'kill'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rav Acha:</span> Are they close to the king? Do they have horses and mules running after them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">R. Dostai:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rav Acha:</span> You acted properly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Beraisa #1:</span> If Reuven said 'take 100 Zuz to Ploni', and Ploni died before the Shali'ach arrived, the money reverts to Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Beraisa #2:</span> The money goes to Ploni's heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Beraisos argue about whether or not saying 'take' is like saying 'Zechi'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> No, all agree that saying 'take' is not as saying 'Zechi';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beraisa #1, Reuven was healthy. In Beraisa #2, he was a Shechiv Mera. (It is as if his words were written and handed over, so Ploni acquired the money immediately.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rav Zevid):</span> In both Beraisos, Reuven was a Shechiv Mera. In Beraisa #1 Ploni died before the money was handed over to the Shali'ach. In Beraisa #2, he was alive at that time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #3 (Rav Papa):</span> In both Beraisos, Reuven was healthy. In Beraisa #1, Ploni died before Reuven died. In Beraisa #2, Reuven died before Ploni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not saying 'take' is like saying 'Zechi':</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven said 'take 100 Zuz to Ploni', and Ploni died before the Shali'ach arrived, the money reverts to Reuven;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Nasan and R. Yakov say, if Reuven died, the money goes to Reuven's heirs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Some say, it goes to Ploni's heirs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehudah ha'Nasi says, it is a Mitzvah to fulfill the words of the deceased. (This is why it goes to Ploni's heirs);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Chachamim say, the heirs of Reuven and Ploni share the money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Chachamim of Bavel say, the Shali'ach decides to whom he wants to give it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ha'Nasi:</span> I was party to such a case. The ruling was, it returns to Reuven's heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue as follows. The first Tana says that 'take' is not like saying 'Zechi'. R. Nasan and R. Yakov agree. They also say that there is no Mitzvah to fulfill the words of the deceased;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>'Some say' hold that saying 'take' is like saying 'Zechi';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>R. Yehudah ha'Nasi says that 'take' is not like saying 'Zechi', but there is a Mitzvah to fulfill the words of the deceased;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>Chachamim say to split the money. They are unsure (whether or not 'take' is like saying 'Zechi', and whether or not there is a Mitzvah to fulfill the words of the deceased);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span>Chachamim of Bavel say, the best solution is to leave it to the best judgement of the Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span>R. Shimon ha'Nasi teaches how they ruled in an actual case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. If Reuven was healthy, all agree that 'take' is not as saying 'Zechi';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue in a case when Reuven was a Shechiv Mera, like R. Elazar and Chachamim argue in the following Mishnah:</p>
