<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE PASUL WITNESS MAY SIGN ANYWHERE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We learn that the relative may sign at the beginning, middle or end, since the Mishnah did not specify where he must sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> A Mekushar Get may be Mekuyam from any three signatures, even if they are not consecutive.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, we would have fixed a place for relatives to sign, and even more would be allowed to sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Ami would tell people (with a bald Get lacking one witness) to ask a slave from the market to complete it.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'MEGARESH</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PARTIAL DIVORCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a man divorced his wife, and said 'you are permitted to any man, Ela (but not) to Ploni', she is permitted to all other men;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, she is (not divorced, and is) forbidden to all men.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He must take the Get and give it again, and say 'you are permitted to all men.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he wrote (the Tanai) in the Get, even if it was later erased, the Get is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How did he forbid her to Ploni? Did he say 'you are permitted to any man except Ploni', or 'you are permitted to any man, on condition that you do not marry Ploni'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'except', in that case, Chachamim argue with R. Eliezer, because the Get does not fully divorce her;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had he said 'on condition', all would agree that this is valid, like any conditional Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'on condition...', in this case, R. Eliezer argues, but had he said 'except...', all would agree that the Get is Pasul, because it does not fully divorce her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> All houses can get (Tum'as) Tzara'as, Ela (but not) those of Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand if this means 'except';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rhetorical question:</span> If it means 'on condition that', can we say that houses of Yisrael can get Tzara'as on condition that that Nochri houses cannot?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> This would imply that if Nochri houses could become Tamei, houses of Yisrael could not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Nochri houses cannot become Tamei. Tzara'as affects only "a house of your inheritance!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Our Mishnah is unlike the following Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> R. Eliezer and Chachamim agree that if he said 'you are permitted to all men except Ploni', she is not divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue only when he said 'you are permitted to all men on condition that you do not marry Ploni.' R. Eliezer permits her to any man except for Ploni. Chachamim forbid her to marry.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">82b----------------------------------------82b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Eliezer holds that this is like any other Tanai;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim hold that this Tanai is different, for it leaves a remnant of marriage that the Get does not sever.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Mishnah, R. Eliezer says that the Get is valid when he says 'except'. What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yanai):</span> "She will leave his house and marry another man" - even if she becomes permitted only to one man, this is considered divorce.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, the verse teaches that she must become permitted to every man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> "Kohanim will not marry a woman divorced from her husband" - even if she was divorced only from her husband (and was not permitted to anyone), she is (divorced and) forbidden to a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, that is a stringency of Kehunah. She is not really divorced.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>KIDUSHIN</i> WITH AN EXCLUSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba):</span> If Reuven was Mekadesh Leah except for Ploni (i.e. regarding Ploni, she is single), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can ask according to R. Eliezer and Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer learned from a verse that partial divorce is valid. No verse validates partial Kidushin, so he must fully Mekadesh her;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, perhaps "v'Yotzah v'Haysah" equates divorce and Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim disqualified partial divorce because the Torah specified "Sefer Krisus (cutting)",  but even a partial Kidushin works;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, perhaps "v'Yotzah v'Haysah" equates divorce and Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> All learn from "v'Yotzah v'Haysah." The Tana'im argue about Kidushin like they do about divorce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If R. Aba is correct (and R. Eliezer validates partial Kidushin), if Reuven was Mekadesh Leah except for his brother Shimon, and Shimon was Mekadesh her except for Reuven, and both died, Leah may do Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Leah is not considered 'the wife of two dead brothers (who may not do Yibum)'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is because Shimon's Kidushin had no effect (she was already forbidden to all other men, and he did not forbid her to Reuven).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had Shimon been Mekadesh her normally, also his Kidushin would have taken effect (to forbid her to Reuven). If both men died, she would be the wife of two dead brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Abaye):</span> If one told his wife 'you are permitted to all men except Reuven and Shimon', and then said 'to Reuven and Shimon', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say, he permitted (her to marry even) the one s he initially forbade her to?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, did he retract to say that she should be permitted only to Reuven and Shimon?</p>
