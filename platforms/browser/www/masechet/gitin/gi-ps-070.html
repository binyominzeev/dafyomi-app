<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EXTERNAL MALADIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>For a wart, one roasts fat wheat kernels on a new shovel. He applies the exuding oil to the wart.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Simi bar Ashi healed Tzara'as in this way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One struck by a poisoned spear will not live;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Eating fatty meat roasted on coals and drinking diluted wine can prolong his life so he can instruct how to apportion his estate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> One who swallows a wasp will not live;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Drinking a Revi'is of strong vinegar can prolong his life so he can instruct how to apportion his estate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> One who eats ox meat with turnips and sleeps under the moon on the night of the fourteenth or fifteenth of the month in summer will contract a fever of the bones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who fills his stomach with anything will contract Achilu (inflammation of the bones).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Even eating too many dates causes it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would I think not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since dates satiate, warm, stop constipation, energize and do not make one finicky, also they do not cause Achilu. He teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> All other liquid medicines are taken for three, seven or 12 days. The cure for Achilu is taken until he recovers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All other liquids are taken on an empty stomach. For Achilu, the patient first eats, drinks, and relieves himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He then kneads lentil flour with old wine and drinks it. He wraps himself in sheets and sleeps until he wakes up on his own, and immediately takes off the sheets.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SUGGESTED HEALTH PRACTICES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Nasan citing Eliyahu):</span> One should eat a third of what his stomach can hold, drink the same amount, and leave a third empty;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In case he gets angry, his stomach will have room to handle it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chiya):</span> To avoid intestinal problems, one should dip his bread in wine or vinegar all year round. If one enjoys his food, he should beware to cease before he fills his stomach; one should not delay excreting when he feels the need.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Ukva):</span> One who drinks Tilya (bad wine) will become weak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> There are 60 types of wine. The best is scented red wine, the worst is white Tilya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man has Bi'ah after letting blood, the children will be weak. If also she just let blood, the children will contract Ra'asan (a severe Tzara'as in which a rodent resides in the brain).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If he ate in between, there is no concern.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> One who has Bi'ah upon returning from a journey will have weak children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should not have Bi'ah after leaving a privy for the time to walk a half Mil (nine or 11 minutes), for the Shed of the privy accompanies him for that long.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did, the children will be epileptic.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who has Bi'ah while standing will get cramps. If he was sitting, or if he lies below her, he is afflicted with Delarya (Aruch's text - Alarya (yawning)).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> The cure for Delarya is saffron that grows in hedge.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Papa would chew it and swallow it. Rav Papi would chew it and spit it out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>One who lacks strength for Bi'ah should drink saffron boiled in wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan attributed his return to youth to this cure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Three things weaken a person - fear, travel and sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn about fear from "my heart is worried; my strength abandoned me."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn about travel from "my strength was afflicted on the way."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We learn about sin from "my strength stumbled in my sin."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>One's body is weakened by eating, drinking or having Bi'ah while standing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If one does any of five things and immediately stands up, he is closer to death than life: eating; drinking; letting blood; sleeping; or Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>These six things will cause death - if one returns weary from travel, lets blood, enters the bathhouse, gets drunk, sleeps on the ground and has Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is only if he does them in order.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Even if he does them out of order, they will weaken him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A case occurred in which a weak slave died after doing only three of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Eight things are harmful if overdone, but are good if done sparingly - travel, Bi'ah, wealth, work, wine, sleep, hot water (for bathing and drinking) and bloodletting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Eight things diminish semen - salt, hunger, Tzara'as, crying, sleeping on the ground, eating coriander, eating gourds out of season, and letting blood below the belt. The last is doubly bad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Letting blood higher than the belt is doubly good.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">70b----------------------------------------70b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Summer is the season for gourds. Then, they are beneficial. In winter, they are harmful. In spring and fall, they are neutral.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO AUTHORIZED A <i>GET</i> AND FELL SICK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If a man appointed Sheluchim to write a Get for his wife, then was seized by Kordaikus, then said that the Get should not be written, his latter words are void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> The Get may be given immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> The Get may be written only after he recovers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reish Lakish learns from the Mishnah - 'his latter words have no effect';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan explains that this means only that he need not give another command to give the Get when he recovers, but it cannot be written while he is sick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Reish Lakish compares a seized man to a sleeping man. R. Yochanan compares him to an insane man.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan does not compare him to a sleeping man, for he will not recover automatically, but a sleeping man awakes automatically.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish does not compare him to an insane man, for we have a cure for Kordaikus, but not for insanity.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yochanan disagree with the following?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a man's windpipe and foodpipe were cut, and he gestured to witnesses to write a Get for his wife, they write and give it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man was found cut up or hanging, and he gestured to witnesses to write a Get for his wife, they write and give it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In those cases, the man is totally sane, just weakness has begun. If one was seized by Kordaikus, his mind is deranged.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a man's windpipe and foodpipe were cut, and he fled, we may testify that he died, permitting his wife to remarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here, Shmuel rules that he is alive. We cannot allow his wife to remarry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is alive, but he will (soon) die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the one who slaughtered him should be exiled (to a city of refuge, if it was unintentional). This is not true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven slaughtered Shimon's windpipe and foodpipe b'Shogeg, he is not exiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Hoshaya):</span> We are concerned lest Shimon did not die from the slaughter alone, rather a wind contributed, or Shimon precipitated his own death (by moving around).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference is there between these reasons?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Shimon was in a marble house and moved about, only the latter concern applies. If he was outside and did not move, only the former concern applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man became unable to speak, and others asked him if we should write a Get for his wife and he nodded his head, we test him three times. If he answers properly no and yes, we write and give the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest a sickness causes him to nod his head as people nod to indicate 'no' or to indicate 'yes'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef bar Minyomi):</span> We test him so he must alternate answers of 'yes' and 'no,'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps a sickness causes him to nod alternatively in these two ways!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not ask in the order of a simple alternation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> We ask him questions relevant to the season.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are examples of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We ask if he would like to be covered with a coat or sheets.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (Failing this test does not show that his mind is disturbed. Perhaps he was struck by a chill, or felt hot!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we ask if one can now find fruits that are out of season.</p>
