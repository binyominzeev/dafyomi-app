<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TANAYIM ON A GET</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Meir):</span> If one said 'this is your Get on condition that you serve my father or nurse my son for two years', the Get is valid even if she does not, since he did not double the Tanai (if you do not serve...);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, the Get is valid only if she fulfills the Tanai;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, every Tanai in the Torah and prophets is doubled!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some explain that he challenges R. Meir. Since we have multiple sources from which to learn the law, we do not learn in general.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Others explain that he challenges Chachamim. We learn from these sources that Tanayim must be doubled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2 - R. Meir):</span> If one said 'this is your Get on condition that you serve my father for two years, or that you nurse my son for two years', if the son or father dies, the Get is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, even if the Tanai was not fulfilled, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>She can say, I am ready to serve or nurse. Bring your father or son!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Both R. Meir and Chachamim contradict their opinions in Beraisa #1!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1 (for R. Meir):</span> In Beraisa #2 he doubled the Tanai, so it is binding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2 (for Chachamim):</span> In Beraisa #2, they hold like R. Shimon ben Gamliel, who says that if she did not cause that the Tanai is not fulfilled, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven told his wife in front of witnesses 'this is your Get on condition that you serve my father for two years', and later told her in front of witnesses 'it is your Get on condition that you give me 200 Zuz', the latter Tanai does not cancel the former;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she fulfills either, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If he said 'this is your Get on condition that you give me 200 Zuz', and later said 'this is your Get on condition that you give me 300 Zuz' (both times were in front of witnesses), the latter Tanai cancels the former. We cannot join one witness who saw the first Tanai with one who saw the second.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which clause does this refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot refer to the Seifa. The first Tanai was cancelled, so surely the witnesses who saw it cannot be used!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it refers to the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since she can make her Get valid by fulfilling either Tanai, it is as if they are one Tanai, and witnesses can join. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A <i>GET</i> CONDITIONAL ON NOT RETURNING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was going from Yehudah to Galil, and he told his wife 'this is your Get on condition that I do not return within 30 days', if he reached Antiferas and returned, the Tanai is Batel (i.e. she is not divorced);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he was going from Galil to Yehudah, and he said 'this is your Get on condition that I do not return within 30 days', if he reached Kefar Osna'i and returned, the Tanai is Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he was going abroad and made this Tanai, reached Ako and returned, the Tanai is Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he said 'this is your Get if I will go 30 days without seeing your face', if he was constantly leaving and returning, since he was not secluded with her, it is a (proper) Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The Mishnah implies that Antiferas is in Galil (the Tanai is void because he reached his destination and did not tarry);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Antiferas is in Yehudah. Kefar Osna'i is in Galil. In between we are in doubt. (If he returned after he passed Antiferas, but before he reached Kefar Osna'i, she has the stringencies of being divorced and not divorced.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">76b----------------------------------------76b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah agrees that Antiferas is in Yehudah. The case is, he made two Tanayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He said 'if I reach Galil, the Get should take effect immediately. Or, if I delay 30 days before returning, the Get should be valid';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, if he reached Antiferas, which is still part of Yehudah, and returned within 30 days, the Tanai is Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he was going abroad... (and reached Ako, the Tanai is Batel)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that Ako is in Chutz La'aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Safra taught that when Chachamim of Bavel would return to Bavel, Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael would accompany them until Ako, for it is forbidden to leave Eretz Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah agrees that Ako is in Eretz Yisrael. The case is, he made two Tanayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He said 'if I reach Chutz La'aretz, the Get should take effect immediately. Or, if I delay 30 days before returning, the Get should be valid';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, if he reached Ako, which is still part of Eretz Yisrael, and returned within 30 days, the Tanai is Batel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW SECLUSION CAN INVALIDATE A <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'this is your Get if I will go 30 days without seeing your face' (since they were not secluded, it is a (proper) Get).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He did see her within 30 days (just they were not secluded)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> 'Seeing your face' is a euphemism for (the lower 'face', i.e.) Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> He literally meant seeing her face. The Mishnah does not say that she is divorced, rather that the Get is proper, i.e. it is not an old Get (in which they had Bi'ah between the writing and the giving);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he later fulfills the Tanai, the Get will take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one said 'this is your Get if I will go 30 days without seeing your face', if he was constantly leaving and returning, since he was not secluded with her, it is a Get. We are not concerned for an old Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> We should be concerned lest he appeased her (Rashi - and was secluded with her; Tosfos - and cancelled the Get)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer: (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> The case is, he trusted her to say that he did not appease her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mishnah):</span> If one said 'this is your Get from now if I don't come within 12 months', and he died within this time, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest he appeased her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> The case is, he trusted her to say that he did not come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>According to Version #2, in the Mishnah, when we do not know that he returned, Rabah bar Rav Huna would be concerned for appeasement had he not trusted her, all the more so in the Beraisa, when we know that he returned!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>According to Version #1, in the Beraisa, when we know that he returned, had he not trusted her, we would be concerned for appeasement. In the Mishnah, when we do not know that he returned, even if he didn't trust her, we are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DOES A DATE PROVE WHEN A <i>GET</i> SHOULD TAKE EFFECT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Mishnah:</span> If one said 'this is your Get if I don't come within 12 months', and he died within this time' the Get is void;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'this is your Get from now if I don't come within 12 months', and he died within this time, the Get is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one said 'write and give a Get to my wife if I don't come within 12 months'; the Sheluchim wrote the Get within 12 months and gave it after 12 months, the Get is void;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi says, it is a valid Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If they wrote and gave the Get after 12 months, and the husband died, if the Get was given before he died, it is valid. If not, it is Pasul. If we do not know, this is the case of (having the stringencies of) being divorced and not divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> (In the Reisha, when he did not say 'from now') our Rebbeyim permitted her to remarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are these Rebbeyim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They are the Beis Din that permitted oil of Nochrim. They hold like R. Yosi, that the date on a document proves that that is the day it should take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> R. Yehudah Nesi'ah ruled this way. His colleagues never consented.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> Did they permit her to remarry immediately, or after 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She should be permitted immediately. Since he died, he cannot come, so the Tanai will definitely be fulfilled!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps she must wait 12 months, until the Tanai was actually fulfilled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Elazar ask regarding the Seifa of our Mishnah ('this is your Get from now if I don't come within 12 months', and he died), from when she may remarry?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He could have asked about the Mishnah. Since he asked an elder who was part of the Beis Din that permitted in the case of the Beraisa, he asked about the Beraisa.</p>
