<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EXCESS FEAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Chachamim say, a man must say three things in his house on Erev Shabbos, close to dark: Have you separated Ma'aseros? Have you made Eruvin? Light the Shabbos lights!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> These must be said gently, so the household will comply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Even before I heard Rabah's teaching, I (reasoned that they should be said gently, and) did so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> One should never instill excessive fear in his house. A great man, R. Chanina ben Gamliel, instilled excessive fear, and they fed him an awesomely forbidden food!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be! Hash-m does not allow a pitfall (eating Isur) to come through animals of Tzadikim, all the more so, not to Tzadikim themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they were about to feed him an awesome thing: a limb from a living animal.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW TO DEAL WITH TORMENTORS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Mar Ukva:</span> There are people that annoy me. I could inform on them to the king. Should I?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Elazar scratched a Sirtut line and replied "I will guard my ways from sinning with my tongue; I will muzzle my mouth while the evil one is in front of me" - even while the evil one is in front of me, I will muzzle my mouth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Mar Ukva:</span> They are bothering me excessively. I cannot bear them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> "Be silent to Hash-m and Hischolel (hope) to Him" - wait for Hash-m, and He will make your enemies fall Chalalim Chalalim (piles of corpses).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rise early to the Beis Medrash and stay late, and your enemies will perish by themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just after R. Elazar said this, Geneiva (who was bothering Mar Ukva) was put in chains to be executed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SIGNS OF SADNESS IN EXILE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that song is forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Ukva):</span> "Do not rejoice Yisrael, do not rejoice like the nations."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he answer "they will not drink wine amidst song; strong drink is bitter to those who drink it"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From that verse, one might have thought that song with instruments is forbidden, but vocal song is permitted. Mar Ukva teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna bar Noson):</span> What do we learn from "Kinah and Dimonah and Ad'adah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> The verse lists cities of Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna bar Noson citing Rav Gaviha):</span> If one has justified anger (Kin'ah) against his friend, but he is silent (Domem), the One who dwells forever (Adei Ad) will judge his case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If so, how will you expound "Tziklag and Madmanah and Sansanah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> If Rav Gaviha were here, he would!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha):</span> If one has a Tza'akas Legimah against his friend (the latter diminished his livelihood) and is Domem (silent), the One who dwells in the (burning) Sneh (bush) will judge his case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (the exilarch):</span> What is the source that crowns of Chasanim are forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> This is a Rabbinic decree;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> During Aspanyanus' siege of Yerushalayim, Chachamim decreed against crowns of Chasanim and drums.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda, after Rav Huna left):</span> We learn from "remove the Mitznefes (turban) and lift off the crown" - people may wear crowns only when the Kohen Gadol wears his Mitznefes (i.e. when the Mikdash stands).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> You expound nicely, but the law is only a Rabbinic decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Mar bar Rav Ashi was making a crown for his daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> Don't you agree that "remove the turban and lift off the crown" forbids this?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Mar bar Rav Ashi:</span> We learn from the Kohen Gadol, and we forbid only those similar to the Kohen Gadol, i.e. men.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from the end of the verse, "this, not this"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Avira):</span> When Hash-m told Yisrael "remove the turban and lift off the crown", the angels asked 'is this fitting for Yisrael, who said "Na'aseh (we will do)" before "Nishma (we will hear)" on Har Sinai?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m answered, this is fitting for Yisrael, who lowered the high and raised the lowly, and set up an idol in the Heichal.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>TZEDAKAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Avira):</span> "If they are complete, or many, even so they will be cut" - if one sees that his income is scarce, he should give Tzedakah from it, and all the more so, if his income is large!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from the end of the verse, "even so they will be cut, and pass"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> If one trims his possessions and gives Tzedakah, he is saved from punishment in Gehinom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is a parable to two sheep passing through water, and only one of them is shorn. Only the shorn sheep can pass.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> "And I afflicted you" - even a poor person supported by Tzedakah should give Tzedakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "I will not afflict you any more" - he will not experience any more signs of poverty.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE NORTHERN BORDER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah says, from Rekem and eastwards (is like Chutz la'Aretz, and from Ako or further north...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that Ako is the northernmost part of Eretz Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If one walks from Ako to Cheziv, on his right, to the east of the path, is Tamei, like Chutz La'aretz. What grows is assumed to be exempt from Ma'aser and Shemitah, unless one knows that it is obligated;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On his left, to the west of the path, is Tahor, like Eretz Yisrael. What grows is assumed to be obligated in Ma'aser and Shemitah, unless one knows that it is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This applies until Cheziv;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi says, it is until Lavlevo.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Only a small strip of land extends north of Ako.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Tana say 'to the east of the path'? A path is not so important to be a reference point!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A verse shows that it is!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"In Shilo... to the east of the path from Beis Kel to Shechem."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>A <i>GET</i> BROUGHT IN A BOAT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> Bringing a Get in a boat is like bringing a Get in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> Bringing a Get in a boat is like bringing a Get in Chutz La'aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Beraisa #1 is like Chachamim, and Beraisa #2 is like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If soil of Chutz La'aretz is in a boat in Eretz Yisrael, Ma'aser and Shemitah apply to what grows in it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, this is only if the boat scrapes the bottom of the river. If it floats (at least 10 Tefachim), it is exempt from Ma'aser and Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Both Beraisos are like R. Yehudah. In Beraisa #1, the boat scrapes the bottom. In Beraisa #2, it floats.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> R. Yehudah and Chachamim also argue about an elevated flowerpot (e.g. on a tripod).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rava):</span> Perhaps all hold that Ma'aser and Shemitah apply!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah exempts only soil in a floating boat, since it moves. He would not exempt a flowerpot, which is stationary!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rava):</span> Perhaps all would exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim obligated soil in a boat, because there is no gap between it and the ground. Water is like a continuation of the river floor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A suspended flowerpot is separated from the ground, so it is exempt!</p>
