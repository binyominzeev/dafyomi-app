<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE LEADERSHIP IN YISRAEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> I was among the Beis Din that Rebbi convened to vote on this law. I was the first to speak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> In matters of money or Tum'ah, the greatest Chacham speaks first (and Rebbi was the greatest). In capital cases, he does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah brei d'Rava):</span> Rebbi conducted differently. He never spoke first. (Rashi - he holds that the greatest Chacham never speaks first. Tosfos - he did not want to show that he was the greatest.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah brei d'Rava):</span> From the time of Moshe until Rebbi, we do not find that the leader of Yisrael was the greatest in Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Yehoshua (bin Nun) was the leader and the greatest in Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Elazar (ben Aharon) was as great in Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Elazar was the greatest (after Yehoshua died)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Pinchas was as great.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> Pinchas was the greatest (after Elazar died)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The elders were as great.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> Sha'ul was the greatest!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel was around.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> After Shmuel died, Sha'ul was the greatest!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah brei d'Rava means, no one else was the greatest all the years of his reign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question #5:</span> Shlomo was the greatest!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shim'i ben Geira was around.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shlomo was greatest after he killed Shim'i!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was not the greatest all the years of his reign.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN WAS THE LEADER OF YISRAEL THE GREATEST IN TORAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #6:</span> Chizkiyah was the greatest!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There was Shevna.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He was killed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chizkiyah was not the greatest all the years of his reign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ezra was the greatest!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Nechemyah ben Chachalyah was as great.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Similarly, from Rebbi until Rav Ashi, the leader was not the greatest in Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Huna bar Noson was the greatest!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Huna was submissive to Rav Ashi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ACQUISITIONS OF CHILDREN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Cheresh (deaf-mute) gestures or reacts to gestures (to make transactions);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Ben Beseirah says, he moves his lips or responds to lip motion (and this suffices) for Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Pa'utos (mature children) buy or sell Metaltelim, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Nachman) Version #1:</span> They argue only about Metaltelim, but all agree that gestures suffice for Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious. The Mishnah explicitly says that they argue about Metaltelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that they argue even about Metaltelim. Rav Nachman teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Just like they argue about Metaltelim, they also argue about Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says only that they argue about Metaltelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, they argue even about Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Pa'utos buy or sell Metaltelim, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> At what age are children considered Pa'utos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is from the age of six or seven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Kahana):</span> It is from the age of seven or eight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> It is from the age of nine or 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They do not argue. It varies according to the sharpness of the child.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was it enacted that Pa'utos can buy and sell Metaltelim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Aba bar Yakov):</span> It is so they can buy their necessities.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "He said to the guardian of the Miltechah, take out clothing for all that serve the idol Ba'al" - what is Miltechah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Aba bar Yakov):</span> (A fabric) that is NiMLal and NimTaCH (rolled and stretched. The Gemara brings these teachings of Rav Acha bar Yakov together, even though they are not related to each other.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> Bunyas ben Bunyas sent to Rebbi four types of linen garments. They were amazingly thin, and could be compressed into the size of a nut and a half.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Up to how much may Pa'utos err, and the transaction is still valid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yonah):</span> It is up to a sixth of the value, like the law of adults.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Can Pa'utos give gifts?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yemar):</span> They cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> They can.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabanan sent these opinions to Rav Mordechai, but they switched them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mordechai):</span> Tell Mar bar Rav Ashi that my Rebbi (his father) ruled that they can give gifts;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This applies whether the child is healthy or dying, whether the gift is large or small.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ENACTMENTS FOR THE SAKE OF <i>SHALOM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are enactments for the sake of Shalom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A Kohen reads the Torah first, followed by a Levi, followed by a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Eruv (bread used to make a courtyard shared by different houses considered one joint domain) is always placed in the same house.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">59b----------------------------------------59b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The pit closest to the irrigation ditch takes water first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>It is considered stealing to take from where fishermen and hunters set their traps;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yosi says, this is absolute theft!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If a Cheresh, lunatic or minor picked up a Hefker object, it is considered stealing to take it from him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yosi says, this is absolute theft!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If an Oni (poor person) knocked down olives from an olive tree, someone else not take the olives below;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Yosi says, this is absolute theft!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>We do not object to poor Nochrim who take Leket, Shichechah and Pe'ah (agricultural gifts left for the poor).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE ORDER OF READING FROM THE TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that a Kohen reads first?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Masnah):</span> "Moshe wrote the Torah and gave it to the Kohanim, the sons of Levi."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know that Kohanim descend from Levi!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, this teaches that a Kohen reads first, then a Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> "Aharon was separated to be the holiest."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> "You will sanctify him (a Kohen)" - for every matter of Kedushah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Beraisa (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "You will sanctify him" for every matter of Kedushah - to speak first, to bless first, and to receive a nice portion first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah say that he reads first for the sake of Shalom. According to these answers, the Torah says that he reads first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> The Torah says so for the sake of Shalom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> All laws of the Torah are for the sake of Shalom - "its ways are ways of Shalom"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (and Answer #4 to Question (a) - Abaye):</span> We understand this from what my Rebbi (Rabah) said. (The enactment was that a Kohen must read first. The Torah teaches that we ask him to read first.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If two eat from a common serving bowl, one does not take another portion until the other finishes his portion (so he can take at the same time);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If three eat and two have finished, they need not wait for the third.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The one who blessed on the bread is the first to take from the bowl (to accompany his bread). He may honor his Rebbi or one greater than himself by letting them take first.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> This applies only to a meal. Regarding reading the Torah, a Kohen may not honor someone else by letting him read first, for this will lead to quarrels.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Masnah):</span> Rabah's law applies only on Shabbos or Yom Tov, when many people are in Beis ha'Keneses, but not on Mondays or Thursdays.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Huna (who was not a Kohen) read first on Shabbos and Yom Tov!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is an exception. Even R. Ami and R. Asi, the greatest Kohanim of Eretz Yisrael, were submissive to him. (People will not quarrel if Rav Huna reads first.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If no Kohen is present, the order is undone. (The Levi does not read at all. Some say that there is no set place for him to read.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If no Levi is present, a Kohen reads in his place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught, a Kohen may not read after a Kohen, lest people think that the latter reads because we found out that the first was not a valid Kohen. A Levi may not read after a Levi, lest people think that either one of them is not a Levi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Kohen who read first also reads the second portion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Leviyim, R. Yochanan is concerned lest people think that either of them is not a Levi. Regarding Kohanim, he is concerned for suspicion only about the first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, everyone knows that the father of the second Kohen is a valid Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that similarly, everyone knows that the father of the second Levi is a valid Levi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People will think that the second Levi's mother is a Mamzeres or Nesinah, therefore he is not a proper Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should be concerned lest people think that the second Kohen's mother is a divorcee or Chalutzah, and he is a Pasul Kohen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (People will not suspect this, for) if he were Pasul, he would not be considered even a Levi, and he would not read second.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> About whom are we concerned (lest they suspect that the first Kohen is Pasul)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We are concerned about people who stay for the entire Torah reading.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They will see that he was counted among the seven who read (so they will know that he is a valid Kohen)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned about people who leave during the Torah reading.</p>
