<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>READING THE TORAH IN THE <i>TZIBUR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (people of Galil):</span> Who reads after the Kohen and Levi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> The next priorities to read are: Chachamim appointed over the Tzibur; Chachamim qualified to be appointed; children of the appointed Chachamim; the heads of the Tzibur; and everyone else.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (people of Galil):</span> May we read the Torah in the Beis ha'Keneses from a scroll containing only one of the five Chumashim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabanan):</span> We learn from R. Yochanan that one may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We may not read in the Beis ha'Keneses from a Sefer Torah missing a column.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He disqualifies a deficient Sefer. We ask about a complete Sefer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> We may not read, for it is dishonorable to the Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> We may not read from a Sefer Haftorah (a scroll containing only the passages from Nevi'im read for the Haftorah), for one may not write such a Sefer. (One may write only complete Sefarim of Tanach.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> One may not even move it on Shabbos, for one may not read from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Halachah does not follow these opinions. Rather, we may move and read from such a Sefer. (We learn from the following.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish read from a Sefer of Agadata on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may not write oral Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since there was no alternative (the teachings were in danger of being forgotten), they could be written - "Es La'asos la'Shem Heferu Torasecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Similarly, we may write and use a Sefer Haftorah (since not every Tzibur can afford a complete set of Nevi'im).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WRITING PORTIONS OF THE TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> May one write a Megilah (a partial Chumash), in order to teach a child?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can ask according to the opinion that the Torah was given (written) one Parshah at a time (and merged at the end), and also according to the opinion that the Torah was given (not written until it was) complete.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to the opinion that the Torah was given one Parshah at a time, we should likewise be allowed to write a Megilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or perhaps, once the Torah was finalized, it can no longer be written piecemeal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>According to the opinion that the Torah was given complete, likewise, we may write only complete Seforim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or perhaps, since there is no alternative (for people who cannot write a full Chumash), one may write a Megilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> According to both opinions, it may not be written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Queen Hilni made a gold tablet on which Parshas Sotah was written (for the Kohanim to copy from).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> Only the first letter of each word was written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The Kohen (who copies the Parshah) looks at the tablet and writes what is written in the tablet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This means that he writes based on what is written in the tablet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> It is written in the tablet "if a man lied (with you)... if a man did not lie."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Only the first word of each verse is properly written in the tablet. Only the initial letters of the other words are written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not one may write a Megilah to teach a child.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not write a Megilah to teach a child;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, one may write from Bereishis until the generation of the flood. One may write from the beginning of Sefer Vayikra until "va'Yhi ba'Yom ha'Shemini."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Torah was given one Parshah at a time - "bi'Mgilas Sefer it is written about me."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The Torah was given complete - "take this Sefer Torah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yochanan explain this verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was said only after the Torah was completed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Reish Lakish explain the verse that R. Yochanan learned from?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The entire Torah is also called a Megilah - "I see a Megilah flying."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Only eight Parshiyos, which were taught on the day that the Mishkan was inaugurated, were written separately.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> The following eight Parshiyos were written on the day that the Mishkan was inaugurated:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The special Isurim of Kohanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The Parshah of the Leviyim (that they will assist the Kohanim);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>That people Tamei at the time of Pesach bring the Korban Pesach on Pesach Sheni (Rashi; Tosfos - that Tamei people may not touch Kodshim);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>The expulsion of Tamei people from the camps;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>That only the Kohen Gadol may enter the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim, during the Yom Kipur service.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span>The Isur for a Kohen to serve while drunk;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span>The lighting of the Menorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">viii.</span>The red heifer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The majority of the Torah is written, the minority is oral - "I will write for him (Yisrael) most of My Torah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The majority of the Torah is oral, the minority is written - "Al Pi (according to - literally, by the mouth) these words" (the covenant was made).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yochanan explain R. Elazar's verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m asks in astonishment "should I write for him most of My Torah? He considers it foreign!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Elazar explain the verse that R. Yochanan learned from?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The covenant was on the oral Torah, for it is harder to learn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehudah bar Nachmani):</span> One verse says "write these words", and another says "Al Pi these words" (they should be oral)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah bar Nachmani):</span> You may not recite (Rashi - teach to Yisrael) written Torah by heart. You may not read oral Torah from a written text (you may not write it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "These" - words of Torah you may write, but you may not write Halachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Hash-m made a covenant with Yisrael only due to the oral Torah - "Al Pi these words I made a covenant with you and with Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ENACTMENTS FOR THE SAKE OF <i>SHALOM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Eruv is placed in the same house (like it used to be) for the sake of Shalom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this needed for Shalom?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is due to the honor of the original house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Shofar (sounded on Erev Shabbos; some say, a collection box for money to support the Yeshivah) of Pumbadisa was originally in Rav Yehudah's home. It later passed to the houses of (the succeeding Roshei Yeshiva, i.e.) Rabah, then Rav Yosef, then Abaye, then Rava!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, if people see it missing from its usual place, they might suspect that people carrying in the courtyard are transgressing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The pit closest to the irrigation channel takes water first...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The people downstream on a river drink from it first;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The people upstream drink first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree that anyone may take whenever he wants like the river flows; they argue about damming up the river to irrigate one's fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel says that the upstream people have priority, for the water comes to them first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav says that the downstream people have priority. They can claim that the river should be allowed to flow. (No one cares what happens downstream from them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Mishnah):</span> The pit closest to the irrigation channel takes water first for the sake of Shalom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel, on behalf of Rav):</span> The case is, the channel passes over the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, obviously they take first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the others can tell him to cover his pit and draw with a bucket (like they do). The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Tachlifa):</span> Since the Halachah was not fixed like either opinion, the strongest party wins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav Simi bar Ashi told Abaye that he would irrigate his fields for him, in order that Abaye would have time to learn with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Simi told the people upstream that the Halachah is that the people downstream drink first. He told the people downstream that the upstream people drink first. He dammed the river and irrigated Abaye's fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Abaye was upset. He did not eat from the Peros of his fields that year (to show his disapproval).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Certain people detoured a river so it would irrigate their fields. People upstream (at the beginning of the detour) complained to Abaye that this ruined it. (It flowed slowly, and flooded their fields.).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Dig to deepen the new course of the river. (This will speed the flow and avoid the flooding.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The upstream people:</span> If so, our irrigation ditches will dry [when the river is low, for water will not enter them!]</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> If so, the downstream people must return the river like initially (Rashi. R. Chananel - the upstream people cannot protest.)</p>
