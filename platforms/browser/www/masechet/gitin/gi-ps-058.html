<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE BLOODSHED IN BEITAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Forty Se'ah of Tefilin were found on the heads of the victims in Beitar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai b'Rebbi Yishmael):</span> Three crates were found. Each held 40 Se'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> 40 crates were found, each holding three Se'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree that they found 40 Se'ah of hand Tefilin and 120 Se'ah of head Tefilin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Forty Se'ah of brain were found on one rock.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> An allusion to this is "happy is the one who will repay (to Bavel what they did to us)... and smash your babies on the rock".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of "precious children of Tziyon Mesula'im with Paz (fine gold)"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They would cover the children with Paz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> D'Vei R. Shilo taught that two small measures of Paz descended to the world. Rome received one , and the rest of the world got the other. (There was not enough to cover the children.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, their beauty made Paz look bad. (Mesula'im is from Solu, to withdraw).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At first, the most important Romans would have Bi'ah in front of the images on their signet rings (to bear children in that image). Once they took the children of Tziyon, they would tie them to the bed and have Bi'ah in front of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">One child (to another):</span> Where does the Torah hint to this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The other:</span> "Also every sickness and affliction that is not written in this Sefer Torah (Hash-m will put upon you)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah, citing R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> "My eyes wail for my soul, from all the daughters of my city" - there were 400 Batei Kenesiyos in Beitar. Each had 400 teachers (of children), and each teacher had 400 children. When the enemy entered, they poked them with their quills (Aruch). When the enemy conquered them, they wrapped the children in Seforim and burned them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Yehoshua ben Chananyah was in Rome. He heard about a beautiful child who was a captive. He stood at the entrance of the prison and said "who caused Yakov to be despoiled, that Yisrael should be to the plunderers"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The child:</span> "For we have sinned to Hash-m, and did not desire to go in His ways, and did not listen to His Torah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> I am sure that this child will give rulings in Halachah! I will not leave until I redeem him for anything they ask.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He redeemed him there for a large sum of money. After a short time, the child gave a ruling in Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>That child was R. Yishmael ben Elisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The son and daughter of R. Yishmael ben Elisha were captured by different men. The captors met; each boasted of the beauty of his captive. They decided to mate the captives to beautiful children, which the captors would split. They put them in a room together.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The children sat in opposite corners. Each thought that the other was a regular slave. Each lamented that he or she, the child (or descendant) of a Kohen Gadol, would be mated with a slave. They cried all night. When morning came, they recognized each other, and died amidst crying.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Yirmeyahu lamented over them "over these I cry. My eye, my eye drips water."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> There was a wondrously beautiful woman, the daughter of a Kohen Gadol. Her captor had his way with her at night. The next morning, he dressed her in seven garments, and took her out to sell her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A particularly repulsive man asked to see her beauty. The captor took off six garments; she tore the seventh and wallowed in the dust.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She beseeched Hash-m - if You will not have compassion on us, why not have compassion on Your great name?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Yirmeyahu lamented over her "the daughter of My nation, gird yourself with sackcloth and wallow in the dust...suddenly the plunderer will come upon us."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It says "on us", not 'on you', for it is as if the plunderers came upon Hash-m as well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "They oppressed a man and his house, a man and his inheritance" refers to a certain apprentice who desired his teacher's wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The teacher needed to borrow money. The apprentice told him to send his wife, and he would lend it to her. He sent her; she stayed there three days, and her husband came to look for her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The apprentice:</span> I gave to her the money, and she left right away! I heard that she had Bi'ah with youths.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The apprentice counseled his teacher to divorce her. He offered to lend to him the money to pay her Kesuvah, for it was large.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He divorced her, and the apprentice married her. The teacher was not able to pay his debt on time; the apprentice asked him to pay the debt by working for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The teacher served his ex-wife and the apprentice. While they ate and drank, his tears flowed into the cup. At this time, the Churban was decreed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Others say, it was decreed due to two men who shared a wife.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE LAW OF SIKRIKON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven bought land from a Sikrikon (and then from Shimon, the original owner, the sale is void).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This is only if Shimon told him to acquire the land through Chazakah, but if Shimon wrote a sale document, the sale is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Even if he wrote a document, the sale is void, unless Shimon writes (that he accepts) Acharayus (to reimburse Reuven if the land is taken from him).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">58b----------------------------------------58b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Shmuel - Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> If Levi bought land on which there was a lien to pay the Kesuvah of Yehudah's wife Leah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he first bought it from Leah and then from Yehudah, the sale is valid. If he first bought it from Yehudah and then from Leah, the sale is void, unless she writes Acharayus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes Rav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Rav explains that 'Acharayus' means a document (i.e. something that prevents her from collecting the land).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven bought land from a Sikrikon and used it for (three) years of Chazakah in front of Shimon (the original owner), then sold it to Levi, Shimon has no claim against Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Levi claims that Reuven bought the land from Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Beraisa should have taught a simpler case: if Reuven never sold it, and he claims that he bought it from Shimon, Shimon has no claim against him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Levi does not claim that Reuven bought the land from Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, (not only Reuven would lose if he didn't claim that he bought it from Shimon,) even Levi does not keep the land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> Really, Levi does not make this claim. In cases like this, we claim on behalf of one who inherits or buys property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, we do not claim on behalf of Reuven, for he knows how he got the land. If he himself does not claim, he loses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The law of Sikrikon (that Reuven can buy the land from the Nochri and give Shimon a quarter of the price) does not apply to a Nochri who took Shimon's land for payment of a debt, or through mere extortion (when there was no concern that he would kill Shimon);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding extortion, it must remain with the Nochri for 12 months. (If not, the land belongs to Shimon.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that the law of Sikrikon does not apply to extortion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Beraisa means that regarding a Sikrikon, the land must stay with the Nochri for 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> There is not extortion in Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We see that there is!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the law of extortion does not apply in Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is an official with whom complaints may be filed. If Shimon did not complain, this shows that he allows the Nochri to keep the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>(A landowner in a valley went away.) Gidal bar Rilai arranged with the neighbors that he would work the land and give the appropriate share of the tax (like the custom). He paid three years of taxes in advance to the king; the owner returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The owner:</span> You gave the taxes for the first year and consumed the Peros. Now I will pay the tax and use my field.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rav Papa):</span> Gidal collects what he paid for the other two years from the neighbors (even though they will have to pay the full tax. Since Gidal is not a landowner in the valley, what he paid will not count.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> If so, you apply the law of Sikrikon to the king! (You say that Gidal gets back what he paid, like the revised version of the Mishnah when Shimon could have redeemed his own land.) There is no Sikrikon in Bavel (the king merely collects taxes)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>COMPENSATING THE ORIGINAL OWNER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This is the first version of the Mishnah. Later, it was enacted that when Reuven buys from a Sikrikon, he gives Shimon a quarter of the price.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> He gives a quarter of the price he paid, in land or in money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He gives a quarter of the land. If he pays in money, he gives a third of the price.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav holds that a Sikrikon sells for four fifths of the true value. Shmuel holds that he sells for three fourths of the true value. (Therefore, Reuven pays Shimon what he saved.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> This is the first version of the Mishnah. Later, it was enacted that when Reuven buys from a Sikrikon, he gives Shimon a quarter of the price;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon may demand to be paid in land or in money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This applies when Shimon could not have redeemed the land himself; if he could have, he may take back his land (and pay Reuven what Reuven paid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi convened a Beis Din, who voted and enacted that if the Sikrikon had the land for 12 months, anyone may buy it, just he must give a quarter to Shimon, in land or money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for Shmuel - Rav Ashi):</span> The Beraisa calls it a quarter (in money), for one quarter of the total  Reuven pays goes to Shimon (i.e. a third of what he paid the Sikrikon).</p>
