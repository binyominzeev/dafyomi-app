<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO MAKES HIS SLAVE <i>HEKDESH</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #3 is like R. Meir, who holds that one does not say empty words (to Hekdesh. Surely he intended to give something to Hekdesh. It is difficult to say that he meant his value, but we must say so.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Seifa of Beraisa #3):</span> The same applies to one who was Makdish himself. He works and eats, for he was Makdish only his own value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this if the Beraisa is like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We can understand the Reisha like Chachamim, since a slave can be sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Seifa cannot be like Chachamim. A free man cannot be sold (so it is unreasonable to say he meant his own value!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about Rabah's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was Makdish his slave, Me'ilah does not apply (to one who benefits from the slave);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, one who benefits from the hair transgresses Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Shimon holds that the slave becomes Hekdesh, and Chachamim disagree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why do they argue about Me'ilah? They should argue explicitly about whether or not he is Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, all agree that he becomes Hekdesh (to be sold).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about the following. Chachamim consider a slave to be like land, so Me'ilah does not apply. R. Shimon holds he is not like land, so Me'ilah applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, they should argue about the slave. Why do they argue about his hair?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rather, all agree that slaves are like land. They argue about whether or not hair that is destined to be cut is considered as if it was cut;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel considers it as if it was cut. Chachamim do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue like the following Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Some things are like land, but are not treated like land. If Reuven claims 'I entrusted you to guard 10 trees laden with fruit'; and Shimon admits to five, Shimon must swear (like one who partially admits to a claim of Metaltelim (movable objects));</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, whatever is connected to land is like land (so he does not swear).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> They argue about grapes ready to be harvested. R. Meir considers them as if they were harvested, Chachamim do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Chachamim who say there is no Me'ilah in the hair could hold like R. Meir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir considers only ripe grapes as if they were harvested, because they get worse if left attached. Hair improves if it is left to grow longer, so it is not considered to be cut.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MAKING A SLAVE <i>HEFKER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Chiya bar Yosef told R. Yochanan about Rav's teaching and this discussion on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Did Rav really say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan agrees!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Ula citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one was Mafkir his slave, he goes free and needs a Get of freedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> R. Yochanan was surprised that Rav agrees with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer:</span> R. Chiya bar Yosef did not finish giving Rav's opinion. R. Yochanan thought that Rav does not require a Get of freedom. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is like Ula taught, that R. Yochanan requires a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba (against Ula) - Beraisa):</span> If a convert died (without heirs), and Yisre'elim were taking his property (which became Hefker), if the convert owned adult or minor slaves, they go free;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Aba Sha'ul says, adults acquire themselves and become free. Minors become the slaves of whoever takes them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that a Get of freedom is not required!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> One who asks such a question does not know how to learn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Ula's say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Ula holds that a convert's slave is like his wife. Just like a convert's wife is permitted without a Get when he dies, also his slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should say the same about a Yisrael's slave!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Slaves of a Yisrael pass to his heirs - "you will bequeath them to your children."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, if a Yisrael was Mafkir his slave and died, the slave should not need a Get (since his heirs do not inherit him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> If one was Mafkir his slave and died, the slave can never become a full Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ameimar's teaching is difficult. (Presumably, he does not argue with his Rebbi, R. Yochanan!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Idi):</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi holds that the Halachah follows Aba Sha'ul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Did R. Yehoshua ben Levi say this explicitly, or did you infer it from something else he said?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did R. Yehoshua ben Levi say, from which it could be inferred?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi said that Rebbi says that if a master despairs of his slave, the only solution for the slave is through a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Rebbi learns from a Gezeirah Shavah "Lah-Lah." Just like a married woman is permitted (Rashi - only) through a Get, also a slave</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Inference:</span> Rebbi equates similar cases. A married woman, who is not the Mamon (monetary property) of her husband, needs a Get, and also a slave who is not the Mamon of his master (i.e. an adult slave who acquired himself when the master was Mafkir him. A minor is always his master's Mamon. Even if the master was Mafkir him, he cannot acquire himself. He remains a full slave, and can marry a Shifchah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Inference:</span> Just like a Get permits a married woman, who is not her husband's Mamon, also death of the master permits only a slave who is not the Mamon of his master (i.e. an adult).

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If R. Yakov bar Idi inferred from this teaching, why would R. Zeira disagree?</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> An adult or minor wife needs a Get to be permitted. The same applies to a slave. (Even if one was Mafkir a minor slave, the slave needs a Get to marry, for he acquires his monetary freedom.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> Just like a Get permits a wife, whether she is an adult or a minor, also death of the master permits (frees) a slave, whether an adult or minor.) (end of Version #2)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT MAKES FREEDOM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> The only solution for the slave is through a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> The slave can pay his own redemption and go free, for this is like selling him to himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi said that the only solution is through a Get because a slave goes free only through redemption money or a Get; since the master despaired, redemption does not apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rebbi teaches unlike the following opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps money can free a slave, just like a Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "She was not redeemed... " - the verse concludes "(because) her (Get of) freedom was not given", she is still a slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This shows that only a Get frees her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Like whom is the Halachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava bar She'ilta):</span> I say that it is unlike R. Shimon. Chachamim of Mechuza say in the name of Rav Nachman that it is like R. Shimon. I asked R. Chiya bar Aba from what ruling this was derived;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> The Shifchah of a Shechiv Mera bewailed 'how long will you work me like a slave?' He threw his hat to her and said 'acquire it and yourself with it.' Rav Nachman ruled that she acquired nothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>An observer understood that this is because the Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This was wrong. She got nothing because the acquisition of Chalipin works only with the Kli of the buyer (receiver), not of the giver.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Shmuel bar Achitai):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> This is wrong. The Halachah does not follow R. Shimon.</p>
