<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DESTRUCTION OF TUR MALKA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Tur Malka was destroyed due to a rooster and a hen. The custom was to bring a rooster and a hen in front of a Chasan and Kalah, an omen that they should be fruitful like chickens.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Once, a Roman troop took the rooster and hen; the Jews hit them. The troop told the Keisar that the Jews were rebelling; he brought an army against them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There was a Yisrael from the south who could leap a Mil (kilometer) and kill soldiers. The Keisar put his crown on the ground.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Jews ate, drank and made a great bonfire. One Mil away, one could see the image on a coin from the fire's light.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He returned to attack them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Tur Malka was attacked by 300,000 sword bearing soldiers. They killed for three days and three nights. On the other side of Tur Malka, they were singing and dancing, unaware of what was happening.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> "Hash-m swallowed, He did not have compassion, all the beautiful places of Yakov." This refers to 600,000 cities of King Yanai in Har ha'Melech;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Each city had 600,000 inhabitants; the following three had twice this amount.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>STORIES OF THE VILLAGE OF SICHNIYA, OF MITZRAYIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A Nochri captured a couple during their Eirusin period (before Nisu'in), and married them to each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The wife:</span> Please don't touch me. I don't have a Kesuvah from you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He didn't touch her his entire life.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>She told the eulogizers that he overcame a harder test than Yosef ha'Tzadik!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yosef was tested only once (by Potifar's wife). My husband was tested every day!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Yosef was not in the same bed with Potifar's wife. My husband was in the same bed with me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Yosef was tempted by another man's wife. My husband refrained from his own wife!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The price (of grain) used to be one Dinar for 40 measures. It rose to one Dinar for 39 measures.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They investigated the cause, and found that a father and son had raped a Na'arah Me'orasah. They stoned them in Beis Din, and the price returned to the normal level.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Once, a man decided to divorce his wife, but her Kesuvah was great, and he did not want to pay it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He gave his wife and a close friend to eat and drink, until they were drunk. He lied them down on a bed, and put egg white on the sheet between them. (It resembles semen. He made it look like they had Bi'ah, to exempt himself from praying her Kesuvah.) He took them to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Bava Ben Buta (a Talmid of Shamai):</span> Shamai taught that if one puts a fire near egg white, it forms a crust. A fire near semen makes it get more absorbed in the sheet.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They tested the sheet, and realized what happened. They whipped her husband, and forced him to pay the Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If they were such Tzadikim, why was the city destroyed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> They did not mourn over Yerushalayim - "gladden Yerushalayim; rejoice in it, all who love it; all who mourn over it will rejoice with it."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE DESTRUCTION OF BEITAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Beitar was destroyed due to a carriage wheel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The custom was to plant a cedar tree when a boy was born, and a Shitah (another species of cedar tree) for a girl. When they got married, they would cut the trees to make the canopy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One day, Keisar's daughter was riding, and the wheel of the carriage broke. They cut down a cedar to fix it; the Jews struck them. The told the Keisar that the Jews were rebelling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> "In (Hash-m's) anger, he cut down the horn (greatness) of Yisrael" - 80,000 horn-blowing troop leaders entered Beitar when they conquered it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They killed men, women and children, until the blood flowed into the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The sea was one Mil (kilometer) away!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ha'Gadol):</span> There are two rivers in the valley called Yadayim; they flow in different directions. They measured and found that two thirds of the flow was water, and one third was blood of those killed in Beitar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The blood sufficed to fertilize the vineyards of the Nochrim for seven years.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> In one valley, Nevuzaradan, the head killer, killed 2,110,000 people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In Yerushalayim, he killed 940,000 on one rock, until their blood touched the blood of Zecharyah - "bloods touched bloods."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nevuzaradan had seen Zecharyah's blood boiling; he asked what it was.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yisre'elim:</span> It is blood of Korbanos that was spilled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Nevuzaradan tested this, and found that blood of Korbanos was unlike the seething blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Nevuzaradan:</span> If you do not tell me, I will tear your skin with iron combs!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yisre'elim:</span> There was a Navi (and Kohen Gadol) who rebuked us about spiritual matters. We killed him (in the Mikdash, on Yom Kipur that was Shabbos). His blood has been boiling all these (more than 200) years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Nevuzaradan:</span> I will appease the blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>He slaughtered the great Sanhedrin and a small Sanhedrin by the blood; it did not rest. He slaughtered male and female youths; the blood did not rest. He slaughtered children learning from their Rebbi; it did not rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Nevuzaradan:</span> Zecharyah, I have slaughtered the best among them. Would you like me to slaughter them all?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The blood rested.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Nevuzaradan repented. He reasoned - if this was the punishment for killing one person, how much greater will be my punishment, for killing so many!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He sent instructions to his home about what to do with his estate, and he converted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Na'aman (whose Tzara'as was cured by Elisha) became a Ger Toshav (a Nochri who keeps his seven Mitzvos and may live in Eretz Yisrael). Nevuzaradan converted. Descendants of Haman taught Torah in Bnei Berak. (This does not prove that we accept converts from Amalek. Perhaps they were from other nations, e.g. descendants of his daughters.) Descendants of Sisera taught children in Yerushalayim. Descendants of Sancheriv taught Torah in public.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The voice of Yakov" refers to (the victims of) Aspasyainus Keisar, who killed 4,000,000 in Beitar. Some say that he killed 40,000,000;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"The hands are the hands of Esav" refers to the evil kingdom that destroyed our house, burned our Heichal, and exiled us from our land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Alternatively, "The voice is the voice of Yakov" teaches that prayer works only for those who descend from Yakov;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The hands are the hands of Esav" teaches that conquest in war comes only to descendants of Esav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The story of Kamtza and Bar Kamtza teaches like R. Elazar taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "When (evil) speech is rampant, hide" - when there is harassing speech, hide.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "By the rivers of Bavel we sat and cried when we remembered Tziyon" teaches that Hash-m showed David (who wrote Tehilim) the destruction of Bayis Rishon and Bayis Sheni;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> There was a boat with 400 boys and girls who were being taken for sexual exploitation. They realized this.</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Upon hearing the answer, the girls jumped into the sea.</p>
