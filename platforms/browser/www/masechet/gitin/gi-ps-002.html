<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>GET</i> FROM ABROAD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who brings a Get (document of divorce) from abroad (Chutz la'Aretz) must say 'it was written and signed in front of me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Gamliel obligates even one who brings from Rekem or Cheger;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer obligates even one who brings from a village near Lud to Lud;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, the only one who must say 'it was written and signed in front of me' is one who brings a Get from abroad, one who takes a Get abroad (from Eretz Yisrael), or one who brings a Get from one province to another in Chutz La'aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel obligates even one who brings from one county (of a governor) to another.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah obligates one who brings from Rekem or eastwards. Rekem itself is considered Chutz La'aretz. From Ashkelon or further south is like Chutz La'aretz. From Ako or further north is like Chutz La'aretz. Rebbi Meir does not obligate one who brings from Ako itself, since it is like Eretz Yisrael for Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Meir says, Ako is like Eretz Yisrael regarding Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>One who brings a Get within Eretz Yisrael need not say 'it was written and signed in front of me.' If the Get is contested, it will be verified through its signatures.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE REASON FOR THE ENACTMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why was this enactment made?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> It was because people in Chutz La'aretz do not know that a Get must be written Lishmah (with intent to divorce that woman).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It was lest the Get be contested, and witnesses will not be readily available to be Mekayem it (verify the signatures).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what case(s) does it matter which is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Two Sheluchim (messengers) brought the Get. (They themselves could verify the signatures, but there is concern for Lishmah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Get was brought from one province to another within Eretz Yisrael. (It is surely Lishmah, but witnesses are not available for Kiyum.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Get is brought within one province in Chutz La'aretz. (Witnesses are available for Kiyum, but we are concerned for Lishmah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah says that people in Chutz la'Aretz are ignorant about Lishmah. Why is the Shali'ach believed to say that he saw it written? We should require two witnesses, like all testimony!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One witness is believed about Isurim (what is forbidden. Monetary cases require two witnesses.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We say so only in cases such as a piece of meat that might be Chelev (forbidden lard) or Shuman (permitted lard), since the piece was never established to be forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, the Get will permit a woman whom we know was married (and forbidden to all other men)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, a Get permits (what was) Ervah (forbidden Bi'ah, i.e. another man's wife). Two witnesses are required for such testimony!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Even in Chutz la'Aretz,) most people know about Lishmah. (Mid'Oraisa, we may rely on this. No testimony is needed at all);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even R. Meir, who normally is concerned for the minority, is not concerned here, since scribes write (almost all) Gitin, and they all know the law of Lishmah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim were stringent to require the Shali'ach to testify about it. They were not so strict to require two witnesses, lest this cause Igun (she would be unable to marry if no one else here knew that the Get was Lishmah.)</p>
