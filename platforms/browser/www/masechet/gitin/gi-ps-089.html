<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FOR WHICH RUMORS ARE WE CONCERNED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If there are rumors that she had Bi'as Zenus, we are not concerned for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because we assume that the rumors started due to mere lewdness, not Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Tana'im argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a woman ate, walked haughtily, or nursed a baby in the market, her husband must divorce her (lest she had or will have Bi'as Zenus);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, he need not divorce her until she becomes the subject of gossiping women.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Nuri:</span> If so, anyone who hates a woman can break up her marriage by starting rumors. The Torah said that one must divorce only due to Ervas Davar (infidelity)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We learn a Gezeirah Shavah between "Ervas Davar" and "according to two or three witnesses a Davar (matter) will be established." In both cases, solid evidence is required.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We are not concerned for the following rumors:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Leah is not a virgin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She was fully married or Mekudeshes (a while ago);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>She was Mekudeshes today, but the rumor omits the name of the husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>She was Mekudeshes today in another city;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>She is a Mamzeres or slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Reuven made his property Hekdesh or Hefker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> We are not concerned for mere hearsay (that Leah was Mekudeshes), unless there were lamps burning, spread beds, and people were going in and out saying 'Leah will be Mekudeshes today.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should we be concerned? They said she will be Mekudeshes. Perhaps she did not become Mekudeshes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they said she became Mekudeshes today.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Levi - Beraisa):</span> We are concerned only if there were spread beds and women happily weaving by burning lamps and saying 'Leah will be Mekudeshes today.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should we be concerned? Perhaps she did not become Mekudeshes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Papa):</span> Rather, they said that she became Mekudeshes today.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> We are concerned only if lamps were burning, beds were spread and people were going in and out;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they said something, we are concerned. If not, this is an excuse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they didn't say anything, this is not an excuse. There is no concern!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This clause teaches unlike Rabah bar Rav Huna, who says that an excuse can come even 10 days later;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah bar bar Chanah holds that if there was talk about Kidushin, an excuse will not help later.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> We are not concerned for mere hearsay, unless two bearers of the rumor say from whom they heard, and also their sources, and we can trace the rumors until we reach clarity.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we reach clarity, that is testimony (not mere rumors)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah citing R. Aba):</span> The bearers of the rumor must name their sources, who are now overseas.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SILENCING RUMORS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Does Beis Din silence unsubstantiated rumors?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Rav Chisda said that the bearers must name sources who are valid witnesses. Since we are concerned only for solid rumors, it follows that we silence unsubstantiated rumors.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Just the opposite! Rav Sheshes said that we are concerned even for rumors from women - it follows, we do not silence rumors.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Different places conduct differently. In Sura, they silence rumors. In Neharde'a, they do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>There was a rumor that Leah became Mekudeshes to a Talmid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chama:</span> What happened?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Her father:</span> She was Mekudeshes on condition that he will not go to Bei Chuzai, and he went!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chama:</span> Since this excuse was not heard when the rumor started, you are not believed (to quell the rumor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>There was a rumor that Leah received remnants of dates left on pits (which are fitting for animals) for Kidushin money, near a spring.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> What is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> All agree that we silence such a rumor. People will assume that it was found that the date remnants were not worth a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rumors came out that Leah became Mekudeshes to one of Reuven's sons.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">89b----------------------------------------89b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All agree that we silence such a rumor. People will say that it was found that a minor was Mekadesh her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rumors came out that Leah became Mekudeshes to Shimon, who was a minor as tall as an adult.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mordechai):</span> (All agree that we silence such a rumor). People realize that he is immature, and they will say that it was found that he is a minor.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>EXCUSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> An excuse can come even 10 days later.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid):</span> Even the possibility of an excuse is like an excuse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa - Mishnah):</span> As long as there is not an excuse...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Zvid):</span> It means 'as long as there is not the possibility of an excuse.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Zvid - Rav Kahana - Mishnah):</span> If (Leah's husband Reuven went overseas and one witness told her that Reuven died, and) Levi was Mekadesh her, and Reuven returned, she is permitted to Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Even though people will assume that Reuven divorced her, we are not concerned, for they will assume that Levi's Kidushin was on condition!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> There is different, for Reuven returned. (They will suspect that she was not divorced, rather she thought that Reuven died.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, she should be permitted even if she married Levi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If she remarried, she transgressed, so she is fined. If she only became Mekudeshes, she did not transgress, so she is not fined.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> We are not concerned for a rumor that was not affirmed by Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> We are not concerned for a rumor that started after Leah was married.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We are concerned for rumors that started after Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chaviva):</span> We are not concerned for rumors that started after Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah is, we are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>AN APPARENT SECOND MARRIAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Bei Rav):</span> If there were rumors that Reuven was Mekadesh Leah, and then Shimon was Mekadesh her with witnesses, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> She must leave Shimon. You should clarify the matter and inform me.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did Shmuel intend to do when he hears?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If he hears that the rumors were unsubstantiated, he will silence the rumors.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shmuel is from Neharde'a. In Neharde'a they do not silence rumors!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the rumors are found to be true, she does not need a Get from Shimon. He argues with Rav Huna:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If Sarah was (assumed to be) married to Levi, and she accepted Kidushin money from Yehudah, she is Mekudeshes to Yehudah, due to Rav Hamnuna's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> If a woman said to her husband 'you divorced me' she is believed, for a woman lacks the audacity to say such a lie to her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel holds that Rav Hamnuna's law applies only when she says this in front of her husband, but she is able to lie when not in front of him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we do if the rumors are found to be unsubstantiated?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> Reuven divorces her, and she marries Shimon. We do not allow that Shimon divorce her and she will marry Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People will say that the rumors were true, Reuven divorced her, and now he is Machazir Gerushaso (remarries his ex-wife) after she became Mekudeshes to another man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Shinena brei d'Rav Idi):</span> We even allow that Shimon divorces her and she marries Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>People will say that Chachamim investigated and found that Shimon's Kidushin was Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there are rumors that Sarah became Mekudeshes to Levi, and later rumors that she became Mekudeshes to Yehudah, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> Also in this case, Levi divorces her, and she marries Yehudah (but not vice-versa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ameimar):</span> She can marry either one (after receiving a Get from the other).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah follows Ameimar.</p>
