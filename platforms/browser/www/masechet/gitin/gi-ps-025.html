<p class="dedicationbox">GITIN 25 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>INVALID <i>GITIN</i> AND <i>CHALITZOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Chalitzah done with the left foot or at night does not permit her to remarry, but it disqualifies her from doing Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chalitzah of a minor Yavam or with a sock does not permit her to remarry, and does not disqualify her from doing Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Ze'iri and Rav Asi):</span> Only the Get in the last clause disqualifies from Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even the last case does not disqualify her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This is consistent with another teaching of R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> Brothers who divide an inheritance (of land) are considered like buyers. Every Yovel, they return the portions they received, and divide the property again. (If he held that Yesh Breirah, he would say that each brother inherited the portion destined for him, and they need not divide again in Yovel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yochanan needed to teach that Ein Breirah in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he taught that Ein Breirah only regarding a Get, one might have thought that this is because it says "for her", i.e. Lishmah, but the Torah requires only a sale to return in Yovel, and not inheritances;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had he taught only about inheritance, one might have thought that this is only a stringency (and we are also stringent about a Get to say that it disqualifies from Kehunah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Alternatively, one might have thought that inheritances return in Yovel in order to return to the original status (undivided), even though there is Breirah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DIFFERENT KINDS OF <i>BREIRAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Hoshaya):</span> If a man told a scribe to write a Get for whichever of his wives will leave the door first, is this valid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah - Mishnah):</span> Even further, if Reuven told a scribe to write a Get for one of his wives, and later he will decide which one , he cannot use it to divorce either wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that Ein Breirah. Such a Get is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Hoshaya - Mishnah):</span> If a man told his children 'I slaughter the Korban Pesach on behalf of whichever of you comes first to Yerushalayim', once the first child enters, he acquires his portion, and his siblings acquire through him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> You cannot ask from there! R. Yochanan said that the father was only training them to be zealous in Mitzvos. (Really, the father gave a share directly to each child at the time of slaughter)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (Mishnah):</span> Once the first child enters, he acquires his portion, and his siblings acquire through him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this if they already owned their shares at the time of slaughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they did not, how could they acquire their shares later?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may be appointed on (acquire a share of) a Korban Pesach, or withdraw from it, until it is slaughtered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Beraisa):</span> A case occurred, and the daughters came to Yerushalayim before the sons. The daughters were zealous, and the sons were lowly. (This shows that the intent was to make them zealous. It does not say that the daughters acquired!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> I do not understand! Rav Hoshaya asked a case of Breirah in which one made a Get contingent on what others will do (which wife will leave first). Rav Yehudah answered from a case of Breirah contingent on the man's own will (which wife he will decide to divorce)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Further, Rav Hoshaya challenged the answer from a case contingent on the will of others!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Perhaps no one distinguishes between Breirah contingent on his own will and Breirah contingent on others' will!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> R. Yehudah holds that Yesh Breirah when it is contingent on the will of others, but not when it is contingent on his own will!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one bought (100 Lugim of) wine from Kusim (and cannot separate the tithes before drinking), he says 'the two Lugim that I will separate later should be Terumah. The 10 Lugim (that I will separate) are Ma'aser Rishon; and nine Lugim are Ma'aser Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He is Meichal (Rashi - redeems the Ma'aser Sheni; Tosfos - mixes the wine) and may drink immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah, R. Yosi and R. Shimon say, he must separate the tithes before drinking.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This shows that R. Yehudah holds that Ein Breirah when it is contingent on his own will. The following shows that he holds that Yesh Breirah when it is contingent on the will of others.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> (If a man gave a Get, to take effect immediately, if he will later die from his sickness,) in the meantime, we consider his wife to be fully married. When he dies (of the sickness), the Get takes effect retroactively.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> Also R. Shimon holds that Yesh Breirah when it is contingent on the will of others, but not when it is contingent on his own will!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa of tithing wine shows that he holds that Ein Breirah when it is contingent on his own will. The following shows that he holds that Yesh Breirah when it is contingent on others' will:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man told a woman 'I will have Bi'ah with you now, to make Kidushin on condition that my father agrees', even if his father does not agree, she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Shimon bar Yehudah says, R. Shimon says that she is Mekudeshes only if his father agrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions - Rava):</span> Both R. Yehudah and R. Shimon hold that Yesh Breirah, even when it is contingent on his own will;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa says why they do not allow relying on Breirah to tithe wine, lest the barrel break before he separates the tithes, and retroactively, he drank Tevel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir is not concerned lest the barrel break.</p>
