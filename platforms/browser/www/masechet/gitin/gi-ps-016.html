<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES WATER JOIN TO BE <i>METAHER</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if the first half still has liquid Tofe'ach, this does not help!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are not connections for Tum'ah or Taharah: a liquid poured or flowing down an incline, or a liquid Tofe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Ilfa asks about when the first half still has liquid Tofe'ach Lehatfi'ach (wet enough to wet something else).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This also is explicit in a Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Tofe'ach Lehatfi'ach connects.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the Beraisa discusses Mikva'os, and it is like R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Mikveh contains exactly 40 Sa'im and two people immersed in it, one after the other, the first is Tahor and the second is Tamei. (Some water remains on the first person, so less than 40 Sa'im remain in the Mikveh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, if the second immerses before the first totally leaves the water, also he is Tahor. (The water on the first person is considered connected to the Mikveh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> We know that if one enters (bathes in, or has poured upon him) three Lugim of Mayim She'uvim ( water that was in a Kli), he is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If he enters half this amount, and the other half falls on him, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> We know that a man had a seminal emission, and he is sick, if nine Kabim of water are poured on him, he is Tahor (i.e. he may learn Torah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If he immerses half (his body), and (nine Kavim of) water is poured on half (his body), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TWO WHO BRING A <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one Shali'ach says 'it was written in front of me', and the other says 'it was signed in front of me' (it is Pasul).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> This is only when only one is a Shali'ach to give the Get. If both are Sheluchim, it is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He exempts two Sheluchim who bring a Get from a declaration.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Reisha):</span> If two Sheluchim say 'it was written in front of us' and one says 'it was signed in front of me', it is Pasul. R. Yehudah says, it is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You should also say that this is only when only one (of those who saw it written) is a Shali'ach to give the Get; but if both are Sheluchim, Chachamim agree that it is Kosher!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When only one (of those who saw it written) is a Shali'ach to give the Get, why do Chachamim and R. Yehudah argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim decree lest people come to be Mekayem other documents when only one witness recognizes the signatures. R. Yehudah does not decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mishnah):</span> If one Shali'ach says 'it was written in front of me', the other says 'it was signed in front of me' (it is Pasul).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> This is even when both are Sheluchim to give the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He obligates two Sheluchim who bring a Get from abroad to make the declaration.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Reisha):</span> If two Sheluchim say 'it was written in front of us' and one says 'it was signed in front of me', it is Pasul. R. Yehudah says, it is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You should also say that this applies even when both (of those who saw it written) are Sheluchim to give the Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> I do!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim and R. Yehudah argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim (in general) require the declaration out of concern lest it was not written Lishmah. (Therefore, even two Sheluchim must testify that they saw it written and signed. Since only one of them saw it signed, we decree that it is Pasul, lest people come to be Mekayem other documents based on one witness);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah (in general) requires the declaration because witnesses are not available for Kiyum. When there are two Sheluchim, there is no concern for Kiyum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rabah and Rava argue like Chachamim and R. Yehudah do!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Each Amora can say that both Chachamim and R. Yehudah hold like he does:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava explains like Version #1;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rabah explains that both are concerned for Lishmah. The Beraisa discusses after the law of Lishmah became well-known;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim decree that the declaration must still be made, lest the law be forgotten again. R. Yehudah does not make this decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, R. Yehudah should argue (and permit) also in the Reisha, when one Shali'ach says 'it was written in front of me', the other says 'it was signed in front of me'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Ula taught that R. Yehudah argues also in the Reisha!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Oshaya, against Ula - Beraisa):</span> R. Yehudah says that the Get is valid in this case, but not in another case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case he disqualifies is when one Shali'ach says 'it was written in front of me' and the other says 'it was signed in front of me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he disqualifies when one says 'it was signed in front of me but not written in front of me,'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since R. Yehudah did not decree lest the law of Lishmah be forgotten again, he also does not decree that the Shali'ach must testify about the writing of the Get (which itself is a decree lest people think that one witness always suffices for Kiyum).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If two Sheluchim brought a Get from abroad, R. Yehudah and Chachamim argue about whether or not they must make a declaration.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah and Rabah):</span> If two Sheluchim bring a Get from abroad, must they say 'it was written and signed in front of us'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> They need not say it. They themselves would be believed to say that they witnessed the divorce. (Therefore, there is no concern lest the husband contest the Get.)</p>
