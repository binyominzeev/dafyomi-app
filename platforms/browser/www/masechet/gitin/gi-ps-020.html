<p class="dedicationbox">GITIN 20 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>REQUIREMENTS OF A <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should be concerned lest the expressions of divorce in the Torah can work like a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Get must be written Lishmah (with intent to divorce that particular woman. A Sefer Torah was not written Lishmah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should be concerned lest the husband bribed the scribe from the beginning to write that part of the Torah Lishmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Get must contain the names of the husband and wife and their cities. A Sefer Torah lacks these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the law is obvious. What is Rav Yosef's Chidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that Mei Milim is not valid writing on parchment treated with gall-nuts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a Get was not written Lishmah, and the scribe traces over the letters, intending to make it Lishmah, R. Yehudah and Chachamim argue about whether or not this works.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A scribe was writing a Sefer Torah. The next word to write was Hash-m's name. He thought that he needs to write 'Yehudah'. He mistakenly omitted the 'Daled'. (The letters of Hash-m's name were written properly, but without the required intent for Hash-m's name). He may trace the quill over the letters, to give Kedushah to the name;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, this is not an ideal writing of Hash-m's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> Perhaps Chachamim said so only regarding a Sefer Torah, for one should beautify Mitzvos; but they would agree that one can fix a Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> I can show that all Gitin are Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> How can he?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Torah says "he will write", and (the practice is that) she pays the scribe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Chachamim enacted that the money she pays belongs to the husband (so the scribe is his Shali'ach)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Torah says "he will give", and Gitin are not worth even a Perutah (the minimal Shi'ur of monetary value, so it is not) considered giving.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Torah requires only giving a Get, even if it has no value!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> A Get written on Isurei Hana'ah (something we may not benefit from) is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael - Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> One may write a Get on an olive leaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> An olive leaf is not worth a Perutah, but many leaves together are worth a Perutah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Isurei Hana'ah have no value at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> A Get written on Isurei Hana'ah is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Levi taught this in Rebbi's name, and the audience was unreceptive. Levi taught this in the name of Chachamim, the audience was receptive.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that this is the Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED WRITING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He will write" - he may not engrave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Engraving is not considered writing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If a slave has a Get of freedom written (engraved) on a board or tablet, he is free;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He does not go free if the Get is embroidered on a cap or ornament (alternatively - mat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> If he engraves the letters themselves (the shapes normally written), it is considered writing, but not if he carves out the (shapes of the) insides (and surrounding area) of the letters (leaving the shapes of the letters raised).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Engraving the insides of the letters is not considered writing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> The writing (of the Tzitz, the Kohen Gadol's headplate) was not sunken in, rather raised, like gold Dinarim (coins).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The writing on gold Dinarim is made by compressing the insides of the letters!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The writing was like gold Dinarim in one way, and unlike it in one way;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The writing was raised; like gold Dinarim. The letters were engraved on the Tzitz, unlike gold Dinarim, in which the insides are compressed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Does a die for stamping coins only compress the background of the writing, or does it also cause the writing to rise?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It only compresses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The writing was not sunken in, rather raised, like gold Dinarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You cannot say that coins are stamped by compressing. The letters (of the Tzitz) must be written!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The writing was like gold Dinarim in one way, and unlike it in one way;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The writing was raised; like gold Dinarim. The letters were engraved on the Tzitz by pounding from the other side, unlike gold Dinarim, in which the area around the writing was compressed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>GIVING THE <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If a man wrote a Get on a gold plate, and told his wife 'take your Get. It is also payment of your Kesuvah', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> It is considered payment of the Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If he said 'receive your Get, and the rest (the part not under the letters of the Get) should count towards payment of the Kesuvah', his words are fulfilled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only because the Get contains more than just the area under the letters. If not, the Get would be invalid (since it was given solely for payment, not l'Shem giving a Get)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, even if the Get contains only what is under the letters, it is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa teaches that even when there is excess, it counts towards paying the Kesuvah only when the husband stipulates.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The excess is the margin of the Get. (If he does not stipulate, it is considered part of the Get.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'this is your Get, but the paper is mine', she is not divorced. If he said 'this is your Get, on condition that you return the paper to me', she is divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question: (Rav Papa):</span> If he says that he keeps the margin between the lines, or between the words, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This should be Pasul, for it is as if he gives her separate strips. A single Get must be given!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the letters reach from one line (or word) to the next (e.g. a Lamed extends up in between words on the line above), so what she keeps is connected.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> A slave was established to belong to Reuven. A Get is written on the slave, and he is now by Reuven's wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we assume that Reuven gave the slave to his wife?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps the slave himself fled to his wife?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> In any case, it should be Pasul. The writing can be erased, and hence forged!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rava understand our Mishnah, which says that a Get may be written on a slave's hand!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Elazar. Edei Chasimah Karsei, even though it can be forged! (The witnesses who saw it given would not recognize if the document was changed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Culmination of question:</span> Rami bar Chama's question applies only when there are no witnesses who saw him give her the slave. How will he answer Rava's question?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Get was tattooed on the slave's hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question k:1):</span> Rava can explain the Mishnah like this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the answer to Rami bar Chama's question?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish taught that possession of animals does not prove ownership (perhaps they walked away from their real owner. Here, also, perhaps the slave came to her on his own!)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DOES A WOMAN KNOW THAT HER HUSBAND MUST OWN THE <i>GET</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If we know that a woman owned a tablet, and her Get is now written on it, and she holds it, do we say that she knew to be Makneh (transfer ownership of) it to her husband when he wrote the Get, or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye - Mishnah - R. Yehudah ben Bava):</span> There was a village near Yerushalayim in which an elder used to lend to everyone. He would write the documents himself, and witnesses would sign. Chachamim permitted this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The document must belong to the one who gives or puts a lien on his property (the borrower)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We assume that he knew to be Makneh the document to the borrower. (Similarly, a wife knows to be Makneh the tablet to her husband.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> That is no proof. An elder knows the law, but perhaps a woman does not!</p>
