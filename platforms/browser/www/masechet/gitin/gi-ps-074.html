<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'this is your Get on condition that you give me 200 Zuz', she is divorced, and she gives;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said ' on condition that you give me within 30 days', she is only divorced if she gave within 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</span> A case occurred in Tzidon in which a man gave a Get on condition that she return his garment. She lost the garment. Chachamim ruled that it suffices that she return its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Mishnah says 'and she gives.' What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> (She is divorced immediately), provided that she eventually gives;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> She is divorced when she gives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make when the divorce takes effect?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the Get was torn or lost in between, according to Rav Huna, the Get works. According to Rav Yehudah, she needs another Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Huna and Rav Yehudah argued similarly about Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If David said 'you are Mekudeshes to me on condition that I give you 200 Zuz', she is Mekudeshes, and he gives;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says 'and he gives.' What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> (She is Mekudeshes immediately,) provided that he eventually gives;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> She is Mekudeshes when he gives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make when the Kidushin takes effect?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Reuven was Mekadesh her in between, according to Rav Huna, she is Mekudeshes to David. He must merely fulfill his condition;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to Rav Yehudah, she is not Mekudeshes to David until he gives (so Reuven's Kidushin takes effect).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Huna and Rav Yehudah needed to argue both about divorce and Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had they argued only about Kidushin, one might have thought that only there Rav Huna says that he is Mekudeshes immediately, for he comes close to her. In divorce he separates from her, so Rav Huna would agree that she is not divorced until she gives the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had they argued only about divorce, one might have thought that only there Rav Huna says that she is divorced immediately, for he is not ashamed to ask her for the money. Regarding Kidushin, she is ashamed to ask him for the money, so Rav Huna would agree that she is not Mekudeshes until he gives the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, had they argued only about divorce, one might have thought that only there Rav Yehudah says that she is not divorced until she gives the money, for he separates from her. In Kidushin, he comes close to her, Rav Yehudah would agree that she is Mekudeshes immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had they argued only about Kidushin, one might have thought that only there Rav Yehudah says that she is not Mekudeshes until he pays, for she is ashamed to ask him for the money. Regarding divorce, he is not ashamed to ask her for the money, so Rav Yehudah would agree that she is not divorced until she gives the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Therefore, they needed to argue in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (against Rav Yehudah - Beraisa):</span> If one said 'this is your Get on condition that you give to me 200 Zuz', even if the Get was torn or lost, she is divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She may not remarry until she pays.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (against Rav Yehudah - Beraisa):</span> If one said 'this is your Get on condition that you give to me 200 Zuz', and he died (without children), if she gave him, she is (divorced and) exempt from Yibum and Chalitzah. If not, she must do Yibum or Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, she may give to his father, brother or another relative (to exempt herself from Yibum and Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue only about whether or not 'to me' also connotes 'or to my heirs', but all agree that she is divorced immediately, on condition that she give the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>These refute Rav Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Beraisos are like Rebbi. I hold like Chachamim, who argue:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rebbi):</span> Saying 'on condition' is like saying 'from now.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> In Bavel, we used to say that Chachamim argue with Rebbi about 'on condition';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When I went to Eretz Yisrael, I heard R. Asi cite R. Yochanan to say that all agree that saying 'on condition' is like saying 'from now.' They argue only about 'from today and after death.'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">74b----------------------------------------74b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one gave a Get 'from today and after death', she is divorced and not divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi says, this is a (proper) Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Yehudah, they argue even about 'on condition.' The Beraisa should rather teach that case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about 'from today and after death', to show that Rebbi holds that it works even in that case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rather, they should argue about 'on condition', to show that Chachamim say it does not work (immediately) even there!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to teach the extremity of the lenient opinion (Rebbi).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MUST A STIPULATION BE FULFILLED EXACTLY AS STATED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'on condition that you give me within 30 days', she is divorced only if she gave within 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that really, he is not insistent that she pay within 30 days, and he said this just to get her to pay quickly. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> A case occurred in Tzidon...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The case does not illustrate a law of the Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated; it means as follows. If he said to her 'on condition that you return my garment', and she lost the garment, since he specifically wanted the garment, she cannot fulfill the condition;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, it suffices that she return its value;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</span> A case occurred in Tzidon in which a man gave a Get on condition that she return his garment. She lost the garment, and Chachamim ruled that it suffices that she return its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Asi):</span> If one said 'this is your Get on condition that you give to me 200 Zuz', and then he pardoned her from paying, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can ask according to Chachamim and according to R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim said that she cannot fulfill the condition with money only because he did not pardon her. Here, he pardoned her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon said that she can give its value only because she appeases him with the money. Here, she did nothing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> She is not divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'my property is forbidden to you (to benefit from) like a Korban, unless you give to my son a Kor of wheat and two barrels of wine', he is forbidden until he gives;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, Reuven can permit this vow by himself, by saying 'I consider it as if I received.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here is different, for he stipulated in order to pain his wife, so the Get cannot work until she pays. There, Reuven stipulated for his own benefit. He may decide that he does not need it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>A case occurred in which a man told his sharecropper 'other sharecroppers irrigate the grain three times a year and receive a quarter of the yield. If you will irrigate four times, I will give you a third.' Rain came, and there was no need for the extra irrigation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> He did no extra work, so he receives only the usual quarter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> It was not needed (he did not detract from his contract). He gets the full third.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Yosef holds like Chachamim, and Rabah holds like R. Shimon. (Just like money helps in place of the garment, rain is in place of irrigation.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This cannot be. The Halachah follows Rabah, and the Halachah in our Mishnah is unlike R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Indeed, Rav Yosef holds like Chachamim. However, Rabah (who surely could hold like R. Shimon) could also hold like Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim said that money cannot replace the garment only regarding divorce, for he intended to pain her. Here, Reuven intends for his own profit. He does not need the extra irrigation!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>GIVING AGAINST THE WILL OF THE RECEIVER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> At first, one who bought a house in a walled city would hide on the day which completed one year after buying it (so the seller would be unable to redeem it, and the buyer would be able to keep it forever);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hillel enacted that the seller may deposit the redemption money in a chamber and forcibly enter the house. The buyer can take his money when he wants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava) Inference:</span> From Hillel's enactment, we learn that if one says 'this is your Get on condition that you give me 200 Zuz', the Get is valid only if he willingly takes the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hillel needed to enact that the seller can give the money against the buyer's will. This implies that without the enactment, giving against his will does not work.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps Hillel needed to enact for when the buyer is not around, but when he is around, whether or not he consents to accept the money, the redemption works!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rava) Inference:</span> From Hillel's enactment, we learn that if one says 'this is your Get on condition that you give me 200 Zuz', the Get is valid whether or not he takes the money willingly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hillel needed to enact only for when the buyer is not around. When he is around, whether or not he consents to accept the money, the redemption works!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps the Get is only valid when he consents to accept the money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It sufficed for Hillel to enact that the money be put in the chamber not in front of the buyer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Whenever R. Shimon ben Gamliel appears in a Mishnah, the law is like him, except for three places: the Mishnayos about a cosigner, the Get in Tzidon (our Mishnah), and a party in a case who finds a proof after the time he was allotted.</p>
