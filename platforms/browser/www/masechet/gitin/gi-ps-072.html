<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE COMMAND TO WRITE A <i>GET</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> R. Yosi does not agree that Mili may be transferred when he tells the Shali'ach to appoint another Shali'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a scribe wrote a Get and one witness signed it, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> The text of the Mishnah says that the scribe (also) signed the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Yosi, who says that Mili may not be transferred to another Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> If R. Yosi agreed that Mili can be transferred when the Shali'ach was told to do so, disaster could result!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a man asked two Sheluchim to ask Reuven (a scribe) to write a Get, and to ask David and Moshe to be witnesses and sign it, the Sheluchim might be concerned for Reuven's disgrace. They might ask him to be one of the witnesses, even though the husband did not authorize this (and the Get will be Pasul)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rather, the Reisha is R. Meir, and the Seifa is like R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Ashi):</span> The entire Mishnah is like R. Yosi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches that not only when he did not say 'give', but even when he said 'give', the Get is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is not only when he did not tell three people. Rather, it is Pasul even when he told three;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is not only when he did not say 'tell (a scribe and witnesses)'. Rather, it is Pasul even when he said 'tell'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a scribe wrote a Get Lishmah and witnesses signed it Lishmah, and they gave it to the husband and he gave it to his wife, it is valid only if the scribe and witnesses heard the husband's voice command them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'They will hear (his voice)' shows that it is not enough that he instructs Sheluchim to command them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'The husband's voice' teaches unlike Rav Kahana (71a, who said that if a Cheresh can communicate by writing, we write and give a Get to his wife).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A <i>GET</i> ON CONDITION THAT ONE DIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If when Reuven gave his wife a Get, he said 'this Get will be valid if I die', 'this is your Get from (after) this sickness' or 'this is your Get after my death', the Get does nothing;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'this is your Get from today if I die', or 'this is your Get from now if I die', the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he said 'this is your Get from now and after my death', she gets the stringencies of being divorced and still married. If she falls to Yibum, she does Chalitzah, but not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he said 'this is your Get from today if I die from this sickness', and he recovered enough to walk in the market, then fell sick and died, we evaluate:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he died from the initial illness, the Get is valid. If not, it is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> When he says 'if I die', it is Pasul. We must say that this is like saying 'after I die.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If he said 'this is your Get from now if I die', the Get is valid. This shows that 'if I die' is not like saying 'after I die'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> 'If I die' has two connotations: from now, or after death;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he prefaces it by saying 'from today', it means from now. If not, it means after death.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DOES THE <i>HALACHAH</i> FOLLOW OUR MISHNAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mishnah):</span> If one said 'this Get will be valid if I die', the Get does nothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If he died without children, the widow does Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that the Get does nothing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It does nothing to permit her to marry a stranger, but she is also forbidden to the Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Seifa says that she does Chalitzah. This implies that in the Reisha, she may do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah is like Chachamim; Rav Huna's law is like R. Yosi, who says that the date on a document proves when it takes effect (in our case, from when it was given).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yosi, Chalitzah should not be needed. She was divorced immediately, before he died!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Huna is unsure whether or not the Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The following episode shows that he was sure!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rav Huna asked Rav Nachman to ask Rabah bar Avuha whether the Halachah follows R. Yosi or not.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar Avuha (citing Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> What is R. Yosi's reasoning?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> The date on a document proves when it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, Rav Huna is unsure whether R. Yosi said this even if the condition was not written in the document, but was stated verbally.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">72b----------------------------------------72b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Was Rav Huna really unsure about this?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'this Get should take effect if I do not return within 12 months', and he died within 12 months, the Get is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chachamim permitted her to get married (without Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> These Chachamim are the Beis Din that permitted the oil of Nochrim. They hold like R. Yosi, who says that the date on a document proves when it takes effect. (Surely, Rav Huna agrees!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Rav Huna was unsure whether or not the Halachah follows R. Yosi regarding a verbal condition.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this really so?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one said 'this is your Get if I die', or 'for I will die', the Get is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he said 'when I will die' or 'after my death', it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He said 'from today', and it is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Mishnah already teaches that if he said 'from today if I die', the Get is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he didn't say 'from today', and it is like R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This shows that the Halachah follows R. Yosi even regarding verbal conditions!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rava was sure, but Rav Huna was unsure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, Rava discusses according to Chachamim, when he said 'from today.' He came to teach about two expressions that are not taught in the Mishnah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'For I will die' is like 'if I die';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'When I will die' is like 'after I die.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mishnah):</span> If one said 'this is your Get after my death', the Get does nothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> According to R. Yosi, if he died without children, the widow does Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Seifa, when he said 'from today and after I die', Chachamim say that she does Chalitzah. Since R. Yosi holds that the date on a document proves when it takes effect, saying 'after my death' is like saying 'from today and after my death', so she will also require Chalitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that R. Yosi holds like Rebbi, who says that the Get is valid and Chalitzah is not needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Huna teaches that this is not so. Rebbi does not hold like R. Yosi, nor does R. Yosi hold like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To what teaching of Rebbi do we refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If one said 'this is your Get from today and after I die', she gets the stringencies of being divorced and still married. If she falls to Yibum, she does Chalitzah, not Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rebbi says, such a Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which teaching of R. Yosi do we refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If one said 'write and give a Get to my wife if I do not return within 12 months', if they wrote the Get within 12 months and gave it after 12 months, the Get is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yosi says, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE <i>GET</i> OF A <i>SHECHIV</i> <i>MERA</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'this is your Get from today if I die from this sickness', and was Omed (recovered) and walked in the market...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Get of a Shechiv Mera (a sick person who fears lest he die) is like a gift he gives. Just like he can retract a gift if he recovers (he gave it only because he expected to die), he can retract his Get (for the same reason).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, if he said to write a Get, we give it, even though he didn't say 'give'. Also regarding a gift, if suffices if he said 'write', even though witnesses didn't acquire on behalf of the recipient.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'this is your Get from today if I die from this sickness', and was Omed and walked in the market, then fell sick and died, we evaluate:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he died from the initial illness, the Get is valid. If not, it is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he can retract, why must we evaluate the cause of death?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rav Huna says that if he gets better, he retracts. He got better!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer: (Mar brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> The case is, he contracted a new sickness just when he was cured of the first sickness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that he was Omed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He recovered from one sickness and caught another sickness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that he walked in the market!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He walked with help of a staff. It teaches that only if he walked on his staff we must estimate. If not, we assume that he died from the first illness.</p>
