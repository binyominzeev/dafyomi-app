<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW MANY MEN MAKE A <i>BEIS</i> <i>DIN</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Tana is not a peddler, who announces everything that he has! (The Tana did not bother to allude to the third judge.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> The judges sign below, or the witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah equates the judges to the witnesses. Just like two witnesses suffice, also two judges suffice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Mishnah does not equate them. The law of each is different.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah mention both witnesses and judges?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that that even if the text of the Pruzbul mentions judges, and they sign below like witnesses, or vice-versa, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CANCELLING A <i>SHALI'ACH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> For Tikun ha'Olam...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is so Mamzerim will not result.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> It is so women will not be Agunos (unable to remarry, if the husband can easily nullify a Get he sent).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan holds like Rav Nachman, that he nullifies in front of two. Therefore, news of the Bitul does not spread. She will remarry, unaware that her Get was void, and her children will be Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish holds like Rav Sheshes, that he nullifies in front of three. Therefore, word of the Bitul spreads, and she will not remarry. The only problem is Igun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If the husband nullified the Get in front of a Beis Din, it is void;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he cannot nullify it or make new Tanayim. If he could, Beis Din's enactments would be weak!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can it be that mid'Oraisa she is married, and we permit her to remarry because we are concerned for the strength of Beis Din?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! Anyone who is Mekadesh a woman does so according to the will of Chachamim. Chachamim said that if one annuls a Get in front of Beis Din, the Kidushin is void!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> This is reasonable if he was Mekadesh her with money. (It turns out that the money was a gift.) If he Mekudeshes her through Bi'ah, how can Chachamim say that she is not Mekudeshes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The Bi'ah was Zenus (extramarital relations).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If Reuven told 10 people to write a Get to his wife, he can cancel the appointment of any of them individually;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he can only cancel their appointment when they are all together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about whether or not a testimony (in our case - appointment) that is partially cancelled is totally cancelled.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi says, the remainder of the testimony stands. If the other Sheluchim (whom he did not cancel) write and give a Get, it is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, the entire testimony is void. If the other Sheluchim write and give a Get, they and she will not know that it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> All agree that if part is cancelled, the remainder stands;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon holds that any matter done in front of 10 people can be undone only in front of 10.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LIKE WHOM IS THE HALACHAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he says 'all of you (write and give a Get to my wife)', what is the law? (Does R. Shimon hold that he can cancel this in front of one of them?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If R. Shimon holds that if a part of a testimony is cancelled, all is cancelled, there is no concern. The other Sheluchim know that they cannot give the Get themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he holds that a matter done in front of 10 people can be undone only in front of 10, he can cancel the Shelichus only when all are together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If he told two people 'give a Get to my wife,' he can cancel either individually;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he can cancel them only together.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since both must sign the Get, it is as if he said 'all (i.e. both) of you', and R. Shimon argues even in this case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> If the Beraisa discussed writing the Get, this reasoning would be correct. However, the Beraisa discusses giving the Get, which even one person can do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> If he appointed each Shali'ach individually, he can cancel either individually.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this if it discusses Sheluchim to give a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if it discusses Sheluchim to write a Get, their testimonies do not combine!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Testimonies of witnesses combine only if they saw the matter together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Shimon rules like R. Yehoshua ben Korchah (who says that testimonies combine even if they did not see the matter together).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> In these two arguments of Rebbi and R. Shimon, R. Aba ruled in one like Rebbi, and in the other, like R. Shimon. I do not know which was which.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> We can determine which one from the following.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in which Rebbi ruled like Chachamim (who are not concerned for the strength of Beis Din).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Parta:</span> If you rule this way, Beis Din has no strength!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi reversed his decision.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Since even Rebbi agreed that we are concerned for the strength of Beis Din, regarding annulment of a Get in front of Beis Din, surely R. Aba ruled like R. Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding 10 who were appointed to write and give a Get, he must have ruled like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Oshaya of Usha also rules like Rebbi in one case, like R. Shimon in the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> There were five elders in front of R. Oshaya. A man came, and R. Oshaya ruled that he must divorce his wife. The man authorized the elders to write and give a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Oshaya told the elders to hide, so the man would not be able to cancel their mission.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If R. Oshaya held like Rebbi (about canceling a Get in front of a Beis Din), even if the elders hid, the man could cancel the Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If R. Oshaya held like R. Shimon (that one who appointed 10 Sheluchim can cancel them only together), why did he tell the elders to hide? It suffices that they separate!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> He holds like R. Shimon ben Gamliel about the former law, and like Rebbi about the latter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows Rebbi in both cases.</p>
