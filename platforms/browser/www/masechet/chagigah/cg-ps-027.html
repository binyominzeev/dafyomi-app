<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE ATONEMENT PROCURED BY ONE'S TABLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse (Yechezkel 41:22) first calls it the "Mizbe'ach," and then calls it the "Shulchan!?"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> This teaches that when the Beis ha'Mikdash is standing, the Mizbe'ach atoned for the person.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Now, though, it is a man's table which atones for him (when he invites poor people to eat there).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE REASON THE TWO MIZBECHOS CANNOT BECOME TAMEI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The outer Mizbe'ach (Mizbe'ach ha'Nechoshes) does not become Tamei, because the Torah calls it "a Mizbe'ach of earth" (Shemos 20:21) (and earth cannot become Tamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The inner Mizbe'ach (Mizbe'ach ha'Zahav) does not become Tamei, because the Torah compares it to the outer Mizbe'ach (Bamidbar 3:31).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE CHACHAMIM SAY THAT THE TWO MIZBECHOS CANNOT BECOME TAMEI BECAUSE THEY ARE COATED (WITH METAL)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> On the contrary -- since they are coated, they <i>should</i> become Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah should be read, "And the Chachamim say that they <i>do become Tamei</i> because they are coated."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Chachamim are addressing the statement of R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer said that the Mizbechos do not become Tamei because the Torah calls them "earth."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He needs that verse because without it, we would think that the Mizbechos become Tamei because of their metal coating.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But even without that verse, they would not become Tamei, even though they have a metal coating, because the Torah already refers to them as "wooden" Mizbechos (and they are not Mekabel Tum'ah for that reason, and not because they are called "earth").</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE FIRE OF HELL DOES NOT HARM TALMIDEI CHACHAMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu in the name of R. Elazar):</span> The fire of Gehenom has no rule over Talmidei Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is learned through a Kal v'Chomer from the salamander.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one who spreads the oil of a salamander -- which is formed from fire -- upon himself is not burned by fire, then certainly a Talmid Chacham -- whose entire body is fire (Yirmeyahu 23:29) -- will not be burned by fire [in Gehenom]!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE FIRE OF HELL DOES NOT HARM THE SINNERS OF ISRAEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The fire of Gehenom has no rule over the sinners of Israel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is learned from a Kal v'Chomer from the Mizbe'ach ha'Zahav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If the gold on the Mizbe'ach ha'Zahav -- which was only a very thin layer of gold -- was not harmed by the fire burning there for so many years, then certainly the sinners of Israel -- who are nonetheless full of Mitzvos like a pomegranate (as derived from Shir ha'Shirim 4:3) -- how much more so they will not be harmed by the fire of Gehenom.</p></div>
