<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ATONEMENT PROCURED BY ONE'S TABLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse (Yechezkel 41:22) first calls it the "Mizbe'ach," and then calls it the "Shulchan!?"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> This teaches that when the Beis ha'Mikdash is standing, the Mizbe'ach atoned for the person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Now, though, it is a man's table which atones for him (when he invites poor people to eat there).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE REASON THE TWO <i>MIZBECHOS</i> CANNOT BECOME <i>TAMEI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The outer Mizbe'ach (Mizbe'ach ha'Nechoshes) does not become Tamei, because the Torah calls it "a Mizbe'ach of earth" (Shemos 20:21) (and earth cannot become Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The inner Mizbe'ach (Mizbe'ach ha'Zahav) does not become Tamei, because the Torah compares it to the outer Mizbe'ach (Bamidbar 3:31).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE <i>CHACHAMIM</i> SAY THAT THE TWO <i>MIZBECHOS</i> CANNOT BECOME <i>TAMEI</i> BECAUSE THEY ARE COATED (WITH METAL)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> On the contrary -- since they are coated, they <i>should</i> become Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah should be read, "And the Chachamim say that they <i>do become Tamei</i> because they are coated."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Chachamim are addressing the statement of R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer said that the Mizbechos do not become Tamei because the Torah calls them "earth."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He needs that verse because without it, we would think that the Mizbechos become Tamei because of their metal coating.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>But even without that verse, they would not become Tamei, even though they have a metal coating, because the Torah already refers to them as "wooden" Mizbechos (and they are not Mekabel Tum'ah for that reason, and not because they are called "earth").</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE FIRE OF HELL DOES NOT HARM <i>TALMIDEI CHACHAMIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu in the name of R. Elazar):</span> The fire of Gehenom has no rule over Talmidei Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This is learned through a Kal v'Chomer from the salamander.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one who spreads the oil of a salamander -- which is formed from fire -- upon himself is not burned by fire, then certainly a Talmid Chacham -- whose entire body is fire (Yirmeyahu 23:29) -- will not be burned by fire [in Gehenom]!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE FIRE OF HELL DOES NOT HARM THE SINNERS OF ISRAEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The fire of Gehenom has no rule over the sinners of Israel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This is learned from a Kal v'Chomer from the Mizbe'ach ha'Zahav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If the gold on the Mizbe'ach ha'Zahav -- which was only a very thin layer of gold -- was not harmed by the fire burning there for so many years, then certainly the sinners of Israel -- who are nonetheless full of Mitzvos like a pomegranate (as derived from Shir ha'Shirim 4:3) -- how much more so they will not be harmed by the fire of Gehenom.</p>
