<p class="dedicationbox">12TH CYCLE DEDICATION<BR>&nbsp;<BR>CHAGIGAH 22 (11 Iyar) - dedicated by the Feldman family in memory of their mother, ha'Rabbanit Sara Dvosya bas Rav Mordechai (of Milwaukee), on the day of her Yahrzeit. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE FIRST STRINGENCY OF <i>KODESH</i> OVER <i>TERUMAH</i>: IMMERSING UTENSILS INSIDE OF OTHER UTENSILS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Since the fifth stringency is because of Chatzitzah, it must be that the first one is for another reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the first one is a Gezeirah in order to prevent one from immersing small utensils (needles and weaving-forks) in a vessel whose mouth is smaller than the reed inserted into the mouth of a leather canteen.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(Mikva'os 6:7) A reed, whose hollow is a diameter of two fingers, is the minimum size necessary for the passage of water to be considered linked to, and part of, the Mikvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava holds like R. Nachman who said in the name of Rabah bar Avuha: There are eleven stringencies in our Mishnah (since the first and the fifth are indeed different cases).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between R. Ila's reason and Rava's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Immersing utensils inside of a Sal or Gargusani (a very wide-mouthed basket) is the difference.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava permits it (since there is no fear that the mouth of the outer vessel will be too small).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Ila prohibits it (since there is still a problem of the inner utensil weighing down upon the outer utensil, being a Chatzitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This Machlokes between Rava and R. Ila is actually a Machlokes between Tana'im, as recorded in a Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana Kama holds like Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Aba Shaul holds like R. Ila.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If this is the reason (R. Ila or Rava) not to immerse utensils inside of utensils for Kodesh, then the same should apply for Terumah and it should be prohibited!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is speaking to Chaverim (who follow the laws of Tum'ah and Taharah), who will be careful when immersing a utensil within another utensil for Terumah, and will do it correctly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though an Am ha'Aretz might see the Chaver immersing a utensil within another utensil and he will go and do it incorrectly, we do not care, because we do not accept Terumah from an Am ha'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Kodesh, though, we must accept from an Am ha'Aretz, because if we do not, it will cause enmity.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Therefore, a Chaver may not immerse a utensil within another utensil for Kodesh, because an Am ha'Aretz might see and do the same (but do it incorrectly), and the Kodesh will be Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We find in a Beraisa that it is R. Yosi who is concerned for causing enmity.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we permit immersing this way for Terumah -- perhaps a Chaver will borrow the utensil from an Am ha'Aretz (and it will be Tamei)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Mishnah (Kelim 10:1) (in which Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argue whether an earthenware vessel of an Am ha'Aretz is able to stop Tum'ah from spreading from one room to another) shows that Chaverim indeed borrow utensils from Amei ha'Aretz!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When a Chaver borrows a utensil from an Am ha'Aretz, he immerses it again (in case the Am ha'Aretz had immersed it inside another utensil).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But a Beraisa says that an Am ha'Aretz is trusted when he says he immersed properly (for Tum'as Mes)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> That is only for Tevilah of his body, but not for Tevilah of a utensil.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This refers to the Tevilah at the end of his seven day Taharah period (when he had Haza'ah in front of us on both the third and seventh days).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Since we were stringent upon him at the beginning (requiring that he wait three days in front of us before doing Haza'ah, and not trusting him that he counted three days already), we were lenient at the end (believing him when he said he did Tevilah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He is believed for Tevilah of a utensil, but only when he says he never immersed a utensil within another utensil.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But if he says that he has immersed a utensil within another utensil, we do not trust that his Tevilah was valid.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE SECOND STRINGENCY OF <i>KODESH</i> OVER <i>TERUMAH</i>: SEPARATE PARTS OF THE UTENSIL BECOME <i>TAMEI</i> FOR <i>TERUMAH</i>, BUT NOT FOR <i>KODESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A utensil (used for Terumah) which became Tamei (mid'Rabanan) on the outside, is only Tamei on the outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The utensil's thick upper edge and handle remain Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it became Tamei on the inside, though, the entire utensil becomes Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>What is the "Beis ha'Tzevitah?"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The place one holds to stretch it out.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The place on the utensil for dipping.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Bivi):</span> Utensils used for Kodesh become Tamei completely, no matter which part of the utensil was touched by Tum'ah; the same applies to utensils used for Chulin which was prepared with Taharah of Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is consistent with the statement of Rabah bar Avuha.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rabah bar Avuha said that the first six stringencies in the Mishnah apply both to Kodesh and to Chulin that was prepared with Taharah of Kodesh.</p>
