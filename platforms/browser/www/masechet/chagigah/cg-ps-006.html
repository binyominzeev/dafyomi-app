<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE MINIMUM AGE OF A CHILD FOR RE'IYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the minimum age of Chinuch for a child is when the child can be carried by his father (Beis Shamai) or walk by himself (Beis Hillel) from Yerushalayim to Har ha'Bayis, how did the child get to Yerushalayim from his hometown? (It must be that he is old enough to walk that far, and if so, this is an older age than both Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai say!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His mother brought him, for she, too, is obligated to come to Yerushalayim because of the obligation of Simchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Beis Shamai, why did Shmuel's parents not bring him to the Mishkan when he was old enough to ride his father's shoulders (Shmuel I 1:22)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His mother Chanah saw that he was especially weak (and that is why she, too, did not go, even though she was obligated because of Simchah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE OBLIGATION OF CHINUCH FOR RE'IYAH FOR A LAME CHILD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A lame or blind child who will never be healed is exempt, like a lame or blind adult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A lame or blind child who will recover is also exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The rule is that whenever an adult is exempt, a child is also exempt.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE MINIMUM VALUE OF THE KORBAN RE'IYAH AND KORBAN CHAGIGAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Beis Shamai maintains that the minimum value of the Korban Re'iyah is more than that of the Korban Chagigah, because the Torah gives importance to the Re'iyah (an Olah) more than the Chagigah (a Shelamim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An Olah is completely burned to Hash-m, and not a Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>More Olos are brought than Shelamim on Shavuos (Vayikra 23).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Beis Hillel maintains that the minimum value of the Korban Chagigah is more than that of the Korban Re'iyah, because the Torah gives importance to the Chagigah (a Shelamim) more than the Re'iyah (an Olah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Shelamim is more important because it was brought in the Midbar before the Torah was given.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>More Shelamim were brought by the Nesi'im than were Olos (Bamidbar 7).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Beis Hillel responds to Beis Shamai's reasons.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Beis Shamai responds to Beis Hillel's reasons.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHAT KORBAN WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE TORAH WAS GIVEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Beis Hillel maintains that Shelamim were brought in the Midbar before the Torah was given (Shemos 24:5).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When the verse (ibid.) says that an Olah was brought, it refers to the Olas Tamid (from which we cannot learn the laws of other Olos, such as the Olas Re'iyah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Beis Shamai maintains that both Shelamim and Olos were brought in the Midbar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When the verse (ibid.) says that an Olah was brought, it refers to the Olas Re'iyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Beis Shamai, R. Yishmael, and R. Eliezer all maintain that the Olah brought in the Midbar was the Olas Re'iyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Beis Hillel, R. Akiva, and R. Yosi ha'Glili all maintain that the Olah brought in the Midbar was the Olas Tamid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Their opinions are inferred from statements that each Tana made.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yishmael's name is removed from the first list because the proof cited as to his opinion is invalidated.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>HOW TO READ THE VERSE REGARDING THE KORBAN BROUGHT IN THE MIDBAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse states, "... they brought up Olos and they sacrificed Shelamim to Hash-m, oxen." (Shemos 24:5)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Does it mean "they brought up [lambs as] Olos, and they sacrificed oxen as Shelamim to Hash-m,"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Or does it mean "they brought up oxen as Olos and as Shelamim to Hash-m?"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The practical difference is to know where to pause when reading the verse.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Alternatively, the practical difference is for a person who vowed to bring an Olah like the Olah that was brought in the Midbar (i.e. does he bring a lamb or an ox?).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Teiku:</span> The question remains unanswered.</p></div>
