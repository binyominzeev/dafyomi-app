<p class="dedicationbox">12th CYCLE DEDICATION:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>CHAGIGAH 4 (23 Nisan) - dedicated by Mr. Avy Reichman of Queens, NY, l'Iluy Nishmas his father, Dovid ben Avraham, for the day of his Yahrzeit. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE TYPE OF <i>SHOTEH</i> WHO IS EXEMPT FROM RE'IYAH (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> Had R. Huna heard the other Beraisa that says that a Shoteh is one who loses everything that is given to him, he would have agreed to R. Yochanan, that it suffices to do one act of insanity to be considered a Shoteh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Teiku):</span> It is not clear, though, whether R. Papa meant that R. Huna would have agreed only in the case of one who tears his clothing (which is a similar form of insanity to one who loses everything), or he would have agreed in all three cases as well.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SOURCE THAT ONLY A MALE IS OBLIGATED IN RE'IYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Zachor" ("males;" Shemos 23:17) excludes women.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>"Zechurcha" ("your males") excludes Tumtum and Androginus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The verse teaches that an Androginus is a new type of creature and is not a male, even though he has male gender signs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>No verse is necessary to exclude a Tumtum, because he is a Safek.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The verse is necessary to exclude a Tumtum whose male genitals are on the outside (but his limb is hidden), and thus is not a Safek but a male, and we might have thought that he is obligated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>"Kol Zechurcha" ("all of your males") includes children.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah (2a) says that children are exempt!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is referring to children who have not reached the age of Chinuch, while the Beraisa is referring to children who have.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But even children who have reached the age of Chinuch are only obligated mid'Rabanan and not mid'Oraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse is only an Asmachta (a scriptural support for the rabbinical enactment).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What, then, does the verse teach mid'Oraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol Zechurcha" exempts men who smell bad as a result of their professions, who are unable to ascend with all other males because of their smell.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SOURCE THAT AN EVED IS EXEMPT FROM RE'IYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A full slave is exempt because a woman is exempt, and a slave keeps only the Mitzvos that a woman must keep, as is learned from a Gezeirah Shavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna and Ravina):</span> A partial slave (half slave, half free) is exempt because of the verse, "[all of your males shall appear] before the Master, Hash-m" (Shemos 23:17).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Only a person who has one Master (Hash-m) is obligated, but not a slave who has another master.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Mishnah (2a) exempts partial slaves when it refers to slaves as, "Slaves who are not free," and not simply as "slaves."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE SOURCES FOR THE OTHER EXEMPTIONS IN THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Regalim" ("festivals," but also means "feet;" Shemos 23:14) excludes a stump-legged person (who does not have two feet).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Alternatively, "Regalim" excludes a person who is lame (Chiger), ill (Choleh), blind (Suma), or elderly (Zaken), as well as one who cannot walk on his feet up to Har ha'Bayis.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"One who cannot walk" refers to a feeble person who cannot walk without shoes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since it is forbidden to enter Har ha'Bayis while wearing shoes, such a person is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>OTHERS WHO ARE EXEMPT FROM RE'IYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An Arel (uncircumsized) is exempt, as R. Akiva derives from a verse (Vayikra 22:4).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A Tamei is exempt, since he is unable to enter the Mikdash, and only one who is able to enter is obligated to do so (Devarim 12:5-6).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan ben Dehavai):</span> One who is blind in one eye is exempt, as derived from the verse (Shemos 23:17).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The verse reads "Yera'eh" ("he shall be seen") and is written "Yir'eh" ("he shall see").</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This teaches that just like Hash-m comes to see you with His two eyes, as it were, so too he comes to be seen by your two eyes.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>VERSES THAT MADE THE AMORA'IM CRY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Huna cried at the contrast between Hash-m's original desire for us to come see Him on the festivals (Shemos 23:17), and His present rejection of us (Yeshayah 1:12).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Huna cried at the contrast between Hash-m's original desire for us to eat at His table (Devarim 27:7), and his present rejection of us (Yeshayah 1:11).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Elazar cried at the comparison between Yosef's rebuke of Yosef's brothers (Bereishis 45:3), and Hash-m's impending rebuke of us.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Elazar cried at the comparison between the fear that Shmuel ha'Navi had of his final judgment (Shmuel I 28:15) and the fear that we must have.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Ami cried at the verse, "Let one put his mouth in the dirt, perhaps there will be hope (Eichah 3:29)" -- so much, and only "perhaps!"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Ami cried at the verse, "Seek righteousness, seek humility, perhaps you will be covered on the day of Hash-m's wrath" (Tzefanyah 2:3) -- so much, and only "perhaps!"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Asi cried at the verse, "Hate evil, love good, and establish justice... perhaps Hash-m will grant favor" (Amos 5:15) -- so much, and only "perhaps!"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Yosef cried at the verse, "There are those taken away without justice" (Mishlei 13:23).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Indeed it happened that a woman was mistakenly taken by the angel of death.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Her remaining years were given to a young Talmid Chacham who endured insult.</p></div>
