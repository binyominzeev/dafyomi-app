<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>MISHNAH</i>: ELEVEN WAYS IN WHICH <i>KODESH</i> IS MORE STRINGENT THAN <i>TERUMAH </i>(cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>.The eleventh way is that an Onen (one who lost a close relative) or Mechusar Kipurim (one who did not yet offer the Korban required to make him Tahor for Kodesh) require Tevilah before they may eat Kodesh foods, while they are permitted to eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE FIRST STRINGENCY OF <i>KODESH</i> OVER <i>TERUMAH</i>: IMMERSING UTENSILS INSIDE OF OTHER UTENSILS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>What is the reason one may not immerse utensils inside of other utensils for Kodesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila):</span> The weight of the inner utensil upon the outer utensil constitutes a Chatzitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the fact that the fifth stringency is because of a Chatzitzah implies that this one is not because of a Chatzitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both are because of Chatzitzah, and both cases are needed for a different Chidush.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Ila is consistent with another statement he made.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Ila said that there are only ten stringencies in our Mishnah (the two cases of Chatzitzah being considered as one).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The first five apply to Kodesh as well as Chulin prepared with the Taharah of Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>The last five apply only to Kodesh, but not to Chulin prepared with the Taharah of Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>The difference is that the first five cases deal with a concern for a d'Oraisa law.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>Therefore, the Rabanan enacted those stringencies to apply to Chulin prepared with Taharah of Kodesh as well.</p>
