<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p><i>MISHNAH</i>: ELEVEN WAYS IN WHICH <i>KODESH</i> IS MORE STRINGENT THAN <i>TERUMAH </i>(cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>.The eleventh way is that an Onen (one who lost a close relative) or Mechusar Kipurim (one who did not yet offer the Korban required to make him Tahor for Kodesh) require Tevilah before they may eat Kodesh foods, while they are permitted to eat Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE FIRST STRINGENCY OF KODESH OVER TERUMAH: IMMERSING UTENSILS INSIDE OF OTHER UTENSILS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>What is the reason one may not immerse utensils inside of other utensils for Kodesh?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ila):</span> The weight of the inner utensil upon the outer utensil constitutes a Chatzitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the fact that the fifth stringency is because of a Chatzitzah implies that this one is not because of a Chatzitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both are because of Chatzitzah, and both cases are needed for a different Chidush.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Ila is consistent with another statement he made.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Ila said that there are only ten stringencies in our Mishnah (the two cases of Chatzitzah being considered as one).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The first five apply to Kodesh as well as Chulin prepared with the Taharah of Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>The last five apply only to Kodesh, but not to Chulin prepared with the Taharah of Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>The difference is that the first five cases deal with a concern for a d'Oraisa law.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p>Therefore, the Rabanan enacted those stringencies to apply to Chulin prepared with Taharah of Kodesh as well.</p></div>
