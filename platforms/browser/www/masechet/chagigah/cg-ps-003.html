<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina or Rava):</span> A partial Cheresh is exempt from Re'iyah, as derived from Hakhel, but is obligated in Simchah and all other Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The verses regarding Hakhel imply that one must be able to teach in order to be obligated, and a person who cannot speak is unable to teach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A person who cannot speak, however, is able to learn, as demonstrated by the two mutes who were found to have learned all of the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum):</span> A Cheresh in one ear is exempt from Re'iyah, as derived from Hakhel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum):</span> A Chiger (lame) in one leg is exempt from Re'iyah, as derived from the word "Regalim."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A stump-legged person is exempt, as derived from "Pe'amim."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Pe'amim" means feet, as the verse describes the beauty of Israel's feet as they ascend to Jerusalem for the festivals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum):</span> "The pit was empty, there was no water in it," teaches that there were, however, snakes and scorpions in the pit into which Yosef was thrown by his brothers.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE DERASHOS OF R. ELAZAR BEN AZARYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yehoshua asked R. Yochanan ben Berokah and R. Elazar Chasma to tell him what Derashah was said by R. Elazar ben Azaryah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>They dissented, until finally persuaded to tell him what they heard.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah requires children to be brought to hear the Torah being read during the Mitzvah of Hakhel in order to give reward to those who bring them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Hash-m said to the Jewish people, "You have made Me recognized as unique in the world, and thus I shall make you unique in the world."</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Words of Torah are compared (Koheles 12) to several types of objects:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>They are like a yoke that guides an animal, as they guide a person from the paths of death to the paths of life.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>They are like nails, which are permanently in place.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>They are like plantlings which reproduce.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>All words of Torah were given by the One G-d to one leader (Moshe); make your ears like a funnel, acquire a discerning heart to hear all of the opinions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>They did not want to tell him the Derashos initially because of an event that occurred.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi ben Durmaskis was punished for relating a Derashah, when asked by R. Elazar to do so, because he attributed the Derashah to the person from whom he heard it, when it actually was a much older, known Derashah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The lands of Amon and Moav must separate Ma'aser Ani in the Shevi'is year.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Those lands were left unsanctified by Olei Bavel, so that the poor people would have a source of sustenance.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE TYPE OF SHOTEH WHO IS EXEMPT FROM RE'IYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are three types of Shoteh:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who goes out alone at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One who sleeps in a graveyard.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One who tears his clothing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yochanan and R. Huna argue whether one must do only one (R. Yochanan) or all three (R. Huna) in order to be classified as a Shoteh.</p></div>
