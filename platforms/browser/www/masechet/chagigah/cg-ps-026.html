<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE STATUS OF MODI'IM ITSELF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Sometimes Modi'im is like inside of Modi'im (and the potter is trusted), and sometimes it is like outside of Modi'im (and the potter is not trusted).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the potter is leaving Modi'im and the Chaver coming in, Modi'im is like inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When both the potter and Chaver are coming in, or both are going out, it is like outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Our Mishnah also teaches this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In one statement, the Mishnah implies that only inside of Modi'im is the potter trusted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In another statement, the Mishnah implies that even in Modi'im itself he is trusted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It must be that one case is when the potter is leaving and the Chaver is coming in, and the other case is when both are leaving or both are coming in.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE TYPE OF VESSEL THE <i>AM HA'ARETZ</i> POTTER IS TRUSTED ON INSIDE OF MODI'IM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They are trusted on small earthenware vessels.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The vessels must be small enough to hold with one hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The vessels may be even be so large that they cannot be held with one hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The vessels must be empty.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The vessels may even be full.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We assume the vessels to be Tahor, even if they are filled with the Am ha'Aretz's own liquid or shirt.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The liquid or shirt itself, though, is of course Tamei</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Indeed, we find (Ohalos 5:4) that it is possible for either the container or the contents to be Tamei, while the other is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>MISHNAH</i>: BELIEVING TAX-COLLECTORS AND THIEVES WHO SAY THAT THEY DID NOT TOUCH ONE'S VESSELS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Tax-collectors who entered one's home are believed to say that they did not touch any utensils (and thus they are Tahor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Likewise, thieves who repented and returned stolen items are believed to say that they did not touch any utensils.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>In Yerushalayim, [Amei ha'Aretz] are trusted with regard to Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>And during the festival, they are trusted even with regard to Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>TAX-COLLECTORS ARE BELIEVED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But another Mishnah says that they are not believed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah, Taharos 7:6):</span> If tax-collectors entered one's home, everything is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah there refers to when they are accompanied by a Nochri (in which case everything is Tamei)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make if they are accompanied by a Nochri?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The dread of the Nochri is upon them (lest the Nochri beat them up if they do not do their job thoroughly).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The dread of the government is upon them (lest the Nochri inform the authorities about them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these two explanations?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A weak Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>IN YERUSHALAYIM, THEY ARE TRUSTED ON THEIR POTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They are trusted on large earthenware vessels for Kodesh (and certainly on small ones).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for all of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because kilns (for making vessels) are not constructed in Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>DURING THE FESTIVAL, <i>AMEI HA'ARETZ</i> ARE TRUSTED EVEN FOR <i>TERUMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From where do we learn this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> The verse states, "All of the people of Yisrael gathered together at the city, as one man, as compatriots (Chaverim)" (Shoftim 20:11) -- the verse makes everyone Chaverim [during the festival].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><i>MISHNAH</i>: WINE AND FLOUR TOUCHED BY <i>AMEI HA'ARETZ</i> DURING THE FESTIVAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>One who opens his barrel [to sell wine] or who begins selling his flour during the festival:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> He may finish selling it even after the festival has passed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> He may not finish selling it after the festival.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">8)</span>LEAVING THE WINE AND FLOUR UNTIL THE NEXT FESTIVAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May he leave it until the next festival (according to the Chachamim)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The hand of all [Amei ha'Aretz] touch it [and make it Tamei], and you suggest leaving it until the next festival!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But until now, during the festival, the hand of all touched it, and yet it was considered Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is different:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Until now, during the festival, the Torah made the Tum'ah of an Am ha'Aretz to be Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Now, however, it becomes Tamei [retroactively] due to the touch of the Am ha'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Say that it is a Machlokes Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One Beraisa says he may leave it until the next festival.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Another Beraisa says that he does not leave it until the next festival.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is not a Machlokes Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Beraisa is the Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The second Beraisa is R. Yehudah, who holds that he may finish selling it after the festival and does not need to leave it until the next festival.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><i>MISHNAH</i>: MAKING THE <i>AZARAH</i> <i>TAHOR</i> AFTER THE FESTIVAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>When the festival has passed, we remove the vessels of the Azarah in order to make them Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the festival ends on a Friday, we wait until after Shabbos to remove the vessels, due to the honor of Shabbos (the Kohanim need time to prepare for Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Even if the festival ends on Thursday, we wait until after Shabbos, because the Kohanim are not available to immerse the vessels.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">10)</span>WHEN THE FESTIVAL ENDS ON THURSDAY, THE KOHANIM ARE NOT AVAILABLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Kohanim are not available to immerse the vessels, because they are busy clearing out all of the ashes (that collected on the Mizbe'ach during the festival).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">11)</span><i>MISHNAH</i>: HOW ARE THE VESSELS OF THE <i>AZARAH</i> MADE <i>TAHOR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>How are the vessels of the Azarah made Tahor?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We immerse the vessels of the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Before the festival, we tell the Kohanim Amei ha'Aretz to be careful not to touch the Shulchan (which cannot be moved from its place in order to be immersed after the festival).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>All of the vessels of the Mikdash have substitutes, in case the first ones became Tamei, they would bring the substitutes in their place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>All of the vessels of the Mikdash require Tevilah --</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>except the Mizbe'ach ha'Zahav and the Mizbe'ach ha'Nechoshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> They do not require Tevilah, because they are like earth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> Because they are coated.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">12)</span>WARNING THE KOHANIM <i>AMEI HA'ARETZ</i> NOT TO TOUCH THE SHULCHAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> [Warn them,] "Be careful not to touch the Shulchan and the Menorah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does our Mishnah not mention the Menorah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse says "Tamid" ("always") with regard to the presence of Shulchan in the Mikdash (Shemos 25:30), but not with regard to the Menorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa, though, holds that since the verse says, "[You shall place] the Menorah across from the Shulchan" (Shemos 26:35), it is as if it says "Tamid" with regard to the Menorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Our Mishnah holds that that verse is teaching only where to place the Menorah (but not when it must be there).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must we warn them not to touch the Shulchan -- it is a wooden vessel that is not mobile!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A wooden vessel that is not mobile does not become Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In order for a vessel to be able to become Tamei, it must be similar to a sack (Vayikra 11:32), which can be moved both while full and while empty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Shulchan indeed is mobile, even when it is full.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">This is as Reish Lakish taught:</span> The Torah refers to the Shulchan as the "Shulchan ha'Tahor" (Vayikra 24:6), implying that it can be Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>How can it be Tamei, though, if it is an immobile wooden vessel?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Torah is teaching that the Shulchan is lifted up in order to show the showbreads to all of the Olei Regalim, so that they should see the miracle that happened with the bread and know how beloved they are to Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It was a great miracle -- the showbreads were as warm and fresh when they were removed as they were when they were placed upon the Shulchan a week earlier (as derived from Shmuel I 21:7).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Say that it can become Tamei, even if it is not mobile, because it is plated in metal!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Mishnah (Kelim 22:1) teaches that we follow the coating of an object with regard to Tum'ah (and thus the metal coating over the Shulchan should make it Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot answer that the Shitim wood of which the Shulchan was made is precious wood and is not subordinate to the metal coating.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yochanan said that the material of the item -- regardless of how high quality it is -- is always subordinate to the coating!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We cannot answer that we follow the coating only when it is permanent (i.e. nailed down to the item), but when it is not permanent (such as the metal coating on the Shulchan, which was not nailed down), we do not follow the coating.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yochanan said that we always follow the coating, whether or not it is permanent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Shulchan is different (and is not subordinate to its metal coating), because the Torah itself calls it a "wooden" vessel (Yechezkel 41:22).</p>
