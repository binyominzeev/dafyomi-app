<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE PROHIBITION OF MELACHAH ON CHOL HA'MOED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the prohibition of Melachah on Chol ha'Moed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Oshiya):</span> "You shall observe Chag ha'Matzos for seven days" (Shemos 23:15) implies that on Chol ha'Moed it is also Asur to do Melachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yonasan):</span> It is a Kal v'Chomer that on Chol ha'Moed it is Asur to do Melachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The days surrounding Chol ha'Moed (the first and seventh days of the festival) are Asur b'Melachah, and</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The days of Chol ha'Moed have a Musaf offering, and</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The days of Chol ha'Moed are called "Mikra Kodesh" (Vayikra 23:4), so certainly they should be Asur b'Melachah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> "You may not do any work of Melachah" (Vayikra 23:7-8) teaches that Chol ha'Moed is Asur b'Melachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Akiva):</span> "These are the festivals of Hash-m..." (Vayikra 23:4) teaches that Chol ha'Moed is Asur b'Melachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Beraisa):</span> "For six [more] days you shall eat Matzah, and on the seventh day shall be a cessation to Hash-m, you may not do any work" (Devarim 16:8).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The six days [of Chol ha'Moed] are compared to the seventh day; just like the seventh day is Asur b'Melachah, so, too, the six days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The six days [of Chol ha'Moed] are not Asur in all forms of Melachah, though, because the verse specifically mentions "on the seventh day."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rather, the Torah gave the authority to the Chachamim to teach which Melachah is Asur and which Melachah is Mutar.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>EULOGIES AND FASTING ARE PERMITTED IN ORDER TO REFUTE THE TZEDUKIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It happened once that R. Tarfon did not permit a eulogy to take place on the Yom Tavo'ach (the day of bringing the Korbanos of Shavuos (presumably when Shavuos fell on Shabbos and its Korbanos were brought on Sunday)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This contradicts our Mishnah, which says that eulogies are permitted on Sunday, when Shavuos falls on Shabbos and its Korbanos are brought on Sunday!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In that incident, Shavuos fell during the week, and its Yom Tavo'ach was not on Sunday.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: DIFFERENT LEVELS (MA'ALOS) OF GUARDING ITEMS FROM TUM'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">The first type of "Ma'alah":</span> different levels of purifying oneself to eat, or touch, different items:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chulin, Ma'aser, and Terumah require Netilas Yadayim (washing the hands).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Kodesh requires Tevilas Yadayim (immersing the hands in a Mikvah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Mei Chatas requires Tevilah of the entire body.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The second type of "Ma'alah:"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one immersed himself in a Mikvah with intention to purify himself for eating one level (e.g. Chulin), he is Asur to eat the higher level (e.g. Ma'aser).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But if one immersed himself for a higher level, he may eat an item from a lower level.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he immersed without any intention at all, it is as if he did not immerse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The third type of "Ma'alah:" The clothing of an Am ha'Aretz is a "Midras" (i.e. Tamei) for one who eats Chulin b'Taharah, and likewise for the higher levels of Taharah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WASHING ONE'S HANDS FOR CHULIN AND FOR MA'ASER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do Chulin and Ma'aser really need Netilas Yadayim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But the Beraisa says that only Terumah needs Netilas Yadayim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah is the Rabanan, who say (Parah 11:5) that Chulin needs Netilas Yadayim, while the Beraisa is Rebbi Meir, who says that Chulin and Ma'aser do not need Netilas Yadayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That answers only Chulin, but we do not find anyone who says that Ma'aser needs Netilas Yadayim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah is referring to eating bread of Ma'aser, which requires Netilas Yadayim, while the Beraisa is referring to eating fruit of Ma'aser, which does not need Netilas Yadayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>As Rav Nachman said, anyone who washes his hands to eat fruit is considered haughty.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>ONE'S INTENTION WHEN IMMERSING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One Beraisa says that one must have intention when washing or immersing one's hands, while another Beraisa says that even without intention, one becomes Tahor!</p></div>
