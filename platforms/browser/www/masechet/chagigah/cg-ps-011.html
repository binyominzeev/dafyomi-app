<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE EXTENT OF THE DETAILS IN THE TORAH OF OTHER CATEGORIES OF HALACHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The laws of Ohalos have very few verses but many detailed laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The laws of Nega'im have many verses but few detailed laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When one has a doubt, he should know where to look to find the answer (for a doubt in Hilchos Ohalos, he should look in the Mishnah, and for a doubt in Hilchos Nega'im, he should look in the Torah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE LAWS OF DINIM (LEGAL JUDGMENTS) HAVE WHAT TO RELY UPON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But they are written explicitly in the Torah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is referring to the teaching of Rebbi (which is not explicit in the Torah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi taught that the verse, "If there is a fatal injury, then he must pay a life for a life," (Shemos 21:23) means that one must pay a monetary penalty (and not literally his life), as is derived from a Gezeirah Shavah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE LAWS OF AVODOS (TEMPLE SERVICE) HAVE WHAT TO RELY UPON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But they are written explicitly in the Torah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is referring to the Avodah of Holachas ha'Dam (which is not explicit in the Torah) and is teaching that Holachas ha'Dam has the status of a full-fledged Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is derived from the verses which teach that Holachas ha'Dam is included in the Avodah of Kabalas ha'Dam.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE LAWS OF TAHAROS (RITUAL PURIFICATION) HAVE WHAT TO RELY UPON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But they are written explicitly in the Torah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is referring to the Shi'ur of a Mikvah (which is not explicit in the Torah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Mikvah must hold at least 40 Se'ah of water, as the Chachamim derived from the verses.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE LAWS OF TUM'OS (RITUAL IMPURIFICATION) HAVE WHAT TO RELY UPON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But they are written explicitly in the Torah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is referring to the Tum'ah caused by a small piece (the size of a barley seed) of a Sheretz (which is not explicit in the Torah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A part of a Sheretz will be Metamei if it is the size of the smallest complete Sheretz, as is derived from the verses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> This is the size of a barley seed, since a Chomet's full size is a barley seed when it is born.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'R. Yehudah):</span> This is the size of the tail of a Halta'ah (which, when dismembered, still moves around, and is thus considered a complete Sheretz).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE LAWS OF ARAYOS (IMMORAL RELATIONS) HAVE WHAT TO RELY UPON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But they are written explicitly in the Torah!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is referring to the prohibition of having relations with the daughter of the woman one raped (which is not explicit in the Torah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This prohibition (and its punishment of Sereifah) are derived from a Gezeirah Shavah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>THESE ARE THE BODY (ESSENTIAL PART) OF THE TORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Only "these" laws, but not all of the others!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Mishnah should read "These and these are the body of the Torah" (meaning <i>all</i> laws, regardless of whether they are explicit or are derived, are equal and constitute the body of the Torah).</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK EIN DORSHIN</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>MISHNAH: EIN DORSHIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Arayos may not be expounded with three people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Ma'aseh Bereishis may not be expounded with two people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Ma'aseh Merkavah may not be expounded with one person.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It may be expounded with one person if he is a Chacham and he understands things by himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Anyone who looks into one of four things is better off having not been created:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is above the world,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>What is below the world,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>What is before the world,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>What is behind (after) the world.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Anyone who does not have compassion for the honor of his Creator is better off having not been created.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>TO WHOM MAY ONE TEACH THE SECRETS OF THE TORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah first says that Ma'aseh Merkavah may not be expounded by one person, which implies that he is already a Chacham if he is learning by himself, and even so he may not expound Ma'aseh Merkavah, and then it says that one person may expound it if he is a Chacham?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means that Arayos may not be expounded <i>to</i> three people, Ma'aseh Bereishis <i>to</i> two people, and Ma'aseh Merkavah <i>to</i> one person, unless that person is a Chacham and understands things by himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>What is the reason Arayos may not be taught to three people?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not because of any implication in the verses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, it is logical; when the secrets of the Halachos of Arayos are taught to only two people, one of the students engages in discussion with the Rebbi, and the other one listens.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But when taught to three people, one engages in discussion with the Rebbi, and the other two discuss it amoung themselves, not hearing what the Rebbi says, and they might come to permit an Isur of Arayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This reasoning applies only to Arayos, but to other topics in the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because people lust for Arayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>And they lust for Arayos both when the opportunity presents itself and when it does not (whereas a person only lusts for thievery when the opportunity presents itself).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>What is the reason Ma'aseh Bereishis may not be taught to two people?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The verse says, "For ask now regarding the early days that preceded you" (Devarim 4:32), in the singular form.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One may not ask about what was before the world was created, for the verse continues, "... from the day that Hash-m created man on the earth."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One may inquiure, however, about the first six days of Creation (before man was created), for the verse says, "... regarding the early days that preceded you."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>One may not ask about what is above the world, below the world, before the world, or after the world, for the verse says, "... from one end of the heaven to the other end of the heaven."</p></div>
