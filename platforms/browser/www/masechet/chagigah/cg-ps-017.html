<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> Shelamim are brought on Yom Tov, but not Olos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But Semichah is not done on them on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> Shelamim and Olos are brought on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>And Semichah is done on them on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> When Shavuos falls on Friday, its Korbanos are brought on Sunday.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> When Shavuos falls on Friday, its Korbanos are brought on that day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Beis Hillel agrees that when Shavuos falls on Shabbos, its Korbanos are brought on Sunday.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But the Kohen does not wear his special garments on Sunday, and eulogies and fasting are permitted, in order to refute the Tzedukim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE FIRST SOURCE FOR TASHLUMIN OF KORBANOS OF SHAVUOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar in the name of R. Oshiya):</span> There is a Hekesh from Shavuos to Pesach (Devarim 16:16), thus giving Shavuos seven days of Tashlumin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though there is also a Hekesh from Shavuos to Sukos (and thus Shavuos should have eight days of Tashlumin), "Tafasta Merubah Lo Tafasta" and that Hekesh is not used to teach Tashlumin for Shavuos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why, then, is Sukos included in the verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach that Sukos requires Linah just like Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beis Hillel in the Mishnah says that when Shavuos falls on Friday, "it has no day to make up the Korbanos."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This implies that Shavuos has no Tashlumin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that it does not <i>need</i> to make up the Korbanos (since they may be brought on Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa says that one who did not bring the Korban of the Chag on "Y. T. of Shavuos" cannot make it up.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This seems to mean "Yom Tov of Shavuos" -- meaning that Shavuos has no Tashlumin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Y. T. of Shavuos" means "Yimei Tavoach" (the days of bringing the Korban, implying that Shavuos <i>does</i> have Tashlumin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa says that Shavuos is celebrated according to the units by which it is counted (i.e. days), implying that it is only one day, and it does not have Tashlumin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is also counted by <i>weeks</i>, and thus it does have Tashlumin for seven days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is as Abaye said, "It is a Mitzvah to count the days to Shavuos (as in Vayikra 23:16), and it is a Mitzvah to count the weeks to Shavuos (as in Devarim 16:9).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SECOND SOURCE FOR TASHLUMIN OF KORBANOS OF SHAVUOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana in Yeshivah of R. Elazar ben Yakov):</span> The Torah says that Shavous shall be celebrated "when you reap the harvest of the land" (Vayikra 23:22).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This reaping cannot be referring to the actual day of Shavuos, because reaping is forbidden on Yom Tov!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It must be referring to the days of Tashlumin of Shavuos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Even though one source was already given by R. Elazar in the name of R. Oshiya (the Hekesh from Shavuos to Pesach), both sources are necessary.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we only had the first source (the Hekesh), we would think that just like the seven days of Pesach have an Isur of Melachah, so, too, the seven days of Tashlumin for Shavuos; therefore we need the second source ("when you reap").</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we only had the second source ("when you reap"), we would not have known how many days of Tashlumin Shavuos has; therefore we need the first source (the Hekesh).</p></div>
