<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE THIRD STRINGENCY OF KODESH OVER TERUMAH: ONE MAY CARRY TERUMAH WHILE CARRYING A MIDRAS, BUT ONE MAY NOT CARRY KODESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why may one not carry Kodesh while carrying a Midras?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because of the incident that occurred.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A person was carrying a barrel of Kodesh wine from one place to another.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The strap of his shoe (which was a Midras of a Zav) tore, and he placed it on top of the barrel, and it fell in and made the wine Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>At that moment, the Chachamim enacted that one may not carry Kodesh while carrying a Midras.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, one should also be prohibited from carrying Terumah with a Midras!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like R. Chananyah ben Akavya, who says that the Chachamim only apply preventative enactments to the exact situation in which the mishap occurred.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To what extent does this enactment apply?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Does this enactment apply only to a [strap of a] shoe that is Tamei, or even to one that is Tahor?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Does it apply only when one is carrying an open barrel, or even when one is carrying a closed barrel?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>These two questions remain unanswered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>What if one transgressed the enactment and carried Kodesh while carrying a Midras (but it did not fall into the Kodesh)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ila):</span> The Kodesh becomes Tamei nonetheless.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The Kodesh remains Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SIXTH STRINGENCY OF KODESH OVER TERUMAH: UTENSILS THAT WERE COMPLETED WITH TAHARAH STILL NEED TEVILAH FOR KODESH, BUT NOT FOR TERUMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Since it says that the utensils were completed with Taharah, it must be referring to utensils made by a Chaver.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why do they need Tevilah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We fear that the spit of an Am ha'Aretz might have fell onto the utensil before it was finished (and not yet fit to become Tamei), and remained moist until the utensil was finished (and fit to become Tamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is our Mishnah not like R. Eliezer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer implies that utensils completed with Taharah require He'erev Shemesh, and not just Tevilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is the implication of the Mishnah (Parah 5:4) in which R. Eliezer requires only Tevilah for utensils being prepared for use with the ashes of the Parah Adumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He does not require that they first be made Tamei with an actual Tum'ah in order to disprove the Tzedukim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The Tzedukim maintain that a Tamei person or utensil which needs He'erev Shemesh to become Tahor could <i>not</i> handle the Efer Parah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>In truth, though, the Efer Parah requires that such a Tamei person or utensil have only Tevilah in order to handle it.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>According to R. Eliezer, if the utensil was not purposely made Tamei and then used for Efer Parah after Tevilah alone, what Heker is there against the Tzedukim?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p>It must be that R. Eliezer holds that all other utensils finished with Taharah require He'erev Shemesh (and the Heker against the Tzedukim is that this utensil requires only Tevilah), not like our Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Our Mishnah could be R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When Rebbi Eliezer requires only Tevilah for a utensil prepared for use with the Efer Parah, that is because he maintains that the Chachamim gave it a status of Tum'as Mes on its seventh day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Thus, there is a Heker against the Tzedukim, who would require He'erev Shemesh to use such a utensil.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SEVENTH STRINGENCY OF KODESH OVER TERUMAH: A UTENSIL JOINS ALL OF ITS CONTENTS TOGETHER FOR KODESH, BUT NOT FOR TERUMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanin):</span> The source is the verse, "One bowl (Kaf Achas)..." (Bamidbar 7:14) -- the verse considers everything in a bowl to be joined together as one.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this stringency really d'Oraisa!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But a Beraisa implies that it is d'Rabanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Akiva added that if a Tevul Yom touched one part of the Soles, Ketores, or Levonah, all of it becomes Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This is clearly d'Rabanan, because R. Akiva is adding to R. Shimon ben Beseira's ruling that if a Tamei person touched one part of the Efer Parah, it all becomes Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Beseira's ruling is d'Rabanan, because the verse (cited by R. Chanin) refers only to things offered upon the Mizbe'ach, and not to Efer Parah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When the Beraisa implies that it is d'Rabanan, it is referring to utensils which do not have any concavity (i.e. they are flat).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Mid'Oraisa, only a utensil with concavity joins its contents together (to become Tamei), while a flat utensil does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The Rabanan enacted that a flat utensil also joins its contents together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Chanin argues with R. Chiya bar Aba.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Chiya bar Aba says that our Mishnah is expressing R. Akiva's teaching.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Thus, according to R. Chiya, this stringency is only d'Rabanan.</p></div>
