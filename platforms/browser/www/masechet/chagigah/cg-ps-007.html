<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE MINIMUM VALUE OF THE <i>KORBAN RE'IYAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah (Pe'ah 1:1) lists the Mitzvos which have no Shi'ur, and "Re'ayon" (the Korban Re'iyah) is one of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshiya b'Rebbi):</span> This means that mid'Oraisa, Re'iyah has no minimum Shi'ur nor maximum Shi'ur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>But the Chachamim decreed that one Me'ah is its minimum Shi'ur.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS THE <i>MITZVAH</i> OF <i>RE'AYON</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah (Pe'ah 1:1) lists the Mitzvos which have no Shi'ur, and "Re'ayon" is one of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Mitzvah of "Re'ayon?"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Being present ("seen") in the Azarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Being present ("seen") with a Korban (Re'iyah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish agree that on the first day of Yom Tov, one must bring a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish agree that whenever one comes on the Yom Tov and brings a Korban, it is accepted from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They argue on the remaining days of Yom Tov in a case when one comes to the Azarah without a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to R. Yochanan, one fulfills the Mitzvah of "Re'ayon" and does not need to bring a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>According to Reish Lakish, one must bring a Korban if he wants to enter the Azarah during the festival.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reish Lakish challenges R. Yochanan's opinion from several sources that clearly state that one must bring a Korban when he comes to the Azarah during the festival.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan answers that they are all referring to the first day of Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan challenges Reish Lakish's opinion from a Beraisa which says, "Just as I (Hash-m) [come to see you] for free, so, too, you [come to be seen] for free."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The argument between R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish is not as originally presented.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They agree that on the remaining days of Yom Tov, one may come to the Azarah without a Korban and fulfill the Mitzvah of "Re'ayon."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about coming to the Azarah with a Korban Re'iyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to R. Yochanan, one may <i>not</i> bring a Korban (for only the Mitzvah of being seen in the Azarah without a Korban has no limit, but the Mitzvah of bringing a Korban Re'iyah has a limit).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>According to Reish Lakish, even the Mitzvah of bringing a Korban Re'iyah has no limit (and one may bring a Korban every time he comes to the Azarah during the festival).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Reish Lakish, what does the verse, "Let your feet be scarce in your Friend's house" (Mishlei 25:17) mean? Does it not mean that one should not bring many Korbanos of Re'iyah!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it does not refer to the Korban Re'iyah (which Reish Lakish permits), but rather it means that one should not sin and thus not bring many Chata'os and Ashamos (which are brought for sins).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THEY MAY NOT GO UP IN HALVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "All of your males" (Shemos 23:17) teaches that you must go up together and "not in halves."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> "Not in halves" means that a person who has ten sons should not bring five up on the first day, and five up on the morrow.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> No verse is needed for that, because it is obvious that one may not teach half of his children to be zealous and half to be lazy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Rather, "Not in halves" exempts those who cannot ascend to Yerushalayim with other people, such as men who smell bad as a result of their professions, who are unable to ascend with all other males because of their smell (as Acherim say in a Beraisa).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH <i>KORBANOS</i> MAY BE BROUGHT ON YOM TOV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(The Mishnah omitted words, and should say) Olos of Nedarim and Nedavos may not be brought on Yom Tov, but only on Chol ha'Mo'ed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Olos Re'iyah may be brought even on Yom Tov (in accordance with Beis Hillel).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argue whether Olos Re'iyah may be brought on Yom Tov or must be brought on Chol ha'Mo'ed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>FROM WHAT TYPE OF PROPERTY MAY ONE BRING <i>KORBANOS</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Olos Re'iyah must be brought from Chulin (one's personal property) and not from Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because of the rule that "any obligatory offering must be brought from Chulin."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Shalmei Simchah, though, may be brought even from Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
