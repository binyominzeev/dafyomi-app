<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>BATHING RESTRICTIONS ON DIFFERENT DAYS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rafram bar Papa citing R. Chisda):</span> On any occasion that is due to mourning, such as Tish'ah b'Av and regular mourning, it is forbidden to bathe whether in hot or cold water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>On any occasion that is due to refraining from pleasure, such as a Ta'anis Tzibur, it is forbidden to bathe in hot water but permitted in cold.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Idi bar Avin):</span> This is also evident from our Mishnah, which states that on a Ta'anis Tzibur, they would lock the (hot) bathhouses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is no proof - if even cold water were forbidden, it could not have said that we lock the rivers!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shisha b. R. Idi):</span> The intent is that since it already said that bathing is forbidden, it wouldn't have to say that the bathhouses are locked unless it was to point out that only hot water is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> A proof for R. Chisda is suggested from a Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Those who are obligated in Tevilah can do so as normal even on Tish'ah b'Av and Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This cannot be referring to warm water, as warm water is drawn and invalid for Tevilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It must therefore be referring to cold water, and we see that only such people may bathe in it, but not others!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Dismissal (R. Chana bar Katina):</span> It is no proof; it may be referring to the hot springs of Tiveriya.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> In the latter part of the Beraisa, it is noted that the loss of the Beis ha'Mikdash justifies losing one bathing a year - we see that even cold water is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Dismissal (R. Papa):</span> It refers to a location where cold water is not to be found.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> A contradiction to R. Chisda is suggested from another Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa states:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The prohibition of Melachah on a Ta'anis Tzibur only applies by day.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The prohibition of wearing leather shoes only applies within a city.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>The prohibition of washing only applies to the whole body, but not to the face, hands and feet.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>The same applies to an excommunicated person and to a mourner.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The latter clause presumably applies to all the aforementioned laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It cannot be referring to warm water, as a mourner may not wash any part of his body with warm water.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>So it must be referring to cold water, and we see that on a Ta'anis Tzibur it is forbidden to bathe in cold water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> It refers to warm water; it is only the earlier laws that are also being applied to a mourner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Another contradiction to R. Chisda is brought:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When R. Yosi b. R. Chanina's sons died, he bathed in cold water during the seven days of mourning!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> In that case, it was allowed because he had consecutive periods of mourning:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a person had consecutive periods of mourning, then if his hair grows overly long, he can cut it with a razor, and he can wash his clothes in water.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> He can use a razor but not scissors; he can wash them in water but not with detergents or sand.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WASHING FOR MOURNERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A mourner may wash in cold water all seven days - it is no different from eating meat and drinking wine.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see otherwise in a Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Bogeres (adult girl) may not let herself appear ugly while mourning for her father.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The implication is that a Na'arah (sub-adult girl) may.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This cannot be referring to hot water, as nobody is allowed to wash in hot water while mourning (not even a Bogeres).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>So it must refer to cold water, and we see that anyone other than a Bogeres is forbidden!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not referring to washing; it is referring to wearing makeup.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A proof for Rava is suggested:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When R. Yosi b. R. Chanina's sons died, he bathed in cold water during the seven days of mourning!?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate version: (Rava):</span> A mourner may not bathe in cold water during the seven days of mourning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>It is different from meat and wine, which are permitted to help lessen one's sorrows.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> If wearing makeup is forbidden, then so is washing clothes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>The Halachah is that a mourner may not wash his body whether in hot or cold water during the seven days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He may, however, wash his face, hands and feet in cold water.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He may not anoint himself in even the slightest amount, except to remove sweat.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHERE TO SAY ANEINU</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we recite the Aneinu prayer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah):</span> An individual in a private fast says Aneinu between the Berachos of Ge'ulah and Refuah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yitzchak):</span> Surely an individual cannot establish his own separate Berachah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rather, he recites it within Shome'a Tefilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Sheshes holds the same.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see otherwise in a Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The difference between an individual and a Tzibur on a fast day is that one says eighteen Berachos and the other says nineteen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Tzibur" cannot refer to the Shalich Tzibur, as he says twenty-four Berachos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It must refer to an individual who accepts a private fast, and an individual who accepts a Ta'anis Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>We see that the latter may establish his own Berachah of Aneinu, thereby totaling nineteen Berachos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to a Shali'ach Tzibur, and it is discussing the first three fasts, when there are not twenty-four Berachos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely it says that the only difference between the first three fasts and the latter fasts is regarding the prohibition of Melachah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It left out this other difference.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> What else was left out, such that we can say that this was left out?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> It says that this is the <i>only</i> difference!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">New answer:</span> The Tana is only referring to prohibitions, not to the forms of prayer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate answer:</span> The twenty-four Berachos are not recited in the middle series of fasts either.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A Beraisa states that the only difference between the middle and last series of fasts is that in the latter, the Shofar is blown and the stores are locked!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggested answer:</span> It left out this other difference.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Refutation:</span> It says that this is the <i>only</i> difference!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Only" cannot be a precise term, as it also left out the difference that the Aron is only placed in the street for the latter fasts.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Refutation:</span> That is not mentioned as it is done publicly.</p></div>
