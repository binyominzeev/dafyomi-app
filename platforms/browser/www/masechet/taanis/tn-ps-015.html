<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> THE ORDER OF THE FAST DAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The order of the fast day is that they would place the Aron in the streets, and put ashes on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They would also put ashes on the head of the Nasi and the Av Beis Din, and then everyone would put ashes on their own heads.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The eldest present would deliver a moving speech about how Ninveh was saved not through fasting, but through sincere repentance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>They would then be led in prayer by someone old, practiced, having children, and poor, so that he can pray with a full heart.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He would say twenty-four Berachos; the usual eighteen, plus an additional six (as discussed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He would conclude the Berachos by respectively blessing Hash-m for having answered Avraham at Har ha'Moriah, the Bnei Yisrael at the Yam Suf, Yehoshua at Gilgal. Shmuel at Mitzpah, Eliyahu at Har ha'Carmel, Yonah in the fish, and David and Shlomo.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>There was a case when the people did not respond with "Amen"; instead, there was a call to blow Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Chachamim responded that the custom was to do that only in Shaar ha'Mizrach and Har ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MISHNAH: THE MISHMAROS AND THE BATEI AVOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(R. Yehoshua):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For the first three fasts, the men of the Mishmar would fast but not all day, and the men of the Beis Av would not fast at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For the second three fasts, the men of the Mishmar would fast all day, and the men of the Beis Av would fast but not all day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>For the last seven fasts, they would both fast all day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(Chachamim):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For the first three fasts, neither group would fast at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For the second three fasts, the men of the Mishmar would fast but not all day, and the men of the Beis Av would not fast at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>For the last seven fasts, the men of the Mishmar would fast all day, and the men of the Beis Av would fast but not all day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The men of the Mishmar may drink wine by night but not by day; the men of the Beis Av may not drink wine at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Both groups are forbidden to have haircuts or wash clothes, except on Thursday because of Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MISHNAH: MEGILAS TA'ANIS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Any day mentioned in Megilas Ta'anis as being forbidden for eulogies is likewise forbidden on the preceding day, but not on the following day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> It is forbidden on both the preceding and following day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Any day mentioned in Megilas Ta'anis as being forbidden for fasting is permitted on both the preceding and following day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> It is forbidden on the preceding day, but not on the following day.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> FASTS CONFLICTING WITH FESTIVALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>We do not decree an initial series of fasts beginning on Thursday, as it will drive food-prices up; instead, the first series of three fasts runs Monday-Thursday-Monday, and the second runs Thursday-Monday-Thursday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Just as the first series cannot begin on a Monday, the same is true for the second and third series.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Raban Gamliel):</span> Fasts are not decreed upon the community on Rosh Chodesh, Chanukah or Purim; but if a series of fasts had already begun, it is not stopped.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> Even though the fasts are not stopped, R. Gamliel agrees that one does not fast all day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same applies to Tish'ah b'Av that fell on Erev Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>THE <i>ARON HA'KODESH </i>DURING THE FASTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that the Aron is placed on the street, presumably even on the first fasts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa states otherwise:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For the first two sets of fasts, everyone would gather in Shul to pray.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For the last set of seven fasts, the Aron would be taken into the street, and dust was placed on it and on people's heads.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Nosson):</span> They would use ashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is only referring to the last set of fasts.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">7)</span>THE ASHES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that first ashes were placed on the heads of the Nasi and the Av Beis Din, and then everyone would place ashes on their own heads.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The order should be the reverse, as we find in a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> With great things, we begin with the greatest, as we find that Moshe spoke to Aharon before his sons.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>With matters of punishment, we begin with the lowliest, as we find that first the snake was cursed, then Chavah, then Adam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a matter of greatness for them; we are telling them that they are sufficiently great to pray on behalf of the community.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do the Nasi and the Av Beis Din have other people place the ashes on their heads?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Someone who shames himself does not compare to someone who is shamed by others.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where are the ashes placed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> On the place of the Tefillin, as the Pasuk speaks of replacing the Efer, ashes, with the Pe'er - Tefillin.</p>
