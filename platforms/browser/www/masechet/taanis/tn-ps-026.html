<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE MA'AMADOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Kohanim bless the people at four times (Shacharis, Musaf, Minchah and Ne'ilah) on three occasions - fasts, Ma'amados, and Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The function of Ma'amados is as follows. The Torah tells everyone to bring Korbanos, but they cannot be brought in the absence of their owners.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Nevi'im therefore decreed that there be twenty-four Mishmaros of Kohanim, paralleled by twenty-four Ma'amados of Kohanim, Levi'im and Yisraelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>When each Mishmar had its turn, the Kohanim and Levi'im would go to serve in the Beis ha'Mikdash and the Yisraelim would gather and read from Ma'ase Bereishis according to each day of the week.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The larger sections would be read by two people, the smaller by one.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>At Shacharis, Musaf and Minchah, everyone would recite it for themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>On Erev Shabbos at Minchah it was not done, out of respect for Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> On any day where there was Hallel, there was no Ma'amad for Shacharis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>On any day where there was a Korban Musaf, there was no Ma'amad for Ne'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>On any day where there was a Korban Eitzim, there was no Ma'amad for Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ben Azai):</span> R. Yehoshua learned as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>On any day where there was a Korban Musaf, there was no Ma'amad for Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>On any day where there was a Korban Eitzim, there was no Ma'amad for Ne'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Akiva retracted and followed Ben Azai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>There were nine occasions when people would donate wood for the pyres and bring Korbanos (as listed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>On the first of Teves there was no Ma'amad as there was Hallel, Korban Musaf, and a Korban Eitzim.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: NATIONAL TRAGEDIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Five calamities befell our ancestors on the Seventeenth of Tamuz:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Luchos were broken;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The bringing of the Tamid was annulled;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The walls of Jerusalem were breached;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Apostemus burned a Sefer Torah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>An idol was placed in the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>...and five on Tish'ah b'Av:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It was decreed that our ancestors would not enter Eretz Yisrael</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The first Beis ha'Mikdash was destroyed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The second Beis ha'Mikdash was destroyed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Beitar was captured;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Jerusalem was razed to the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>From the beginning of Av, pleasure is curtailed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>During the week in which Tish'ah b'Av falls, it is forbidden to have haircuts or wash clothing, except on Thursday out of respect for Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>On Erev Tish'ah b'Av, a person may not eat two cooked foods, eat meat or drink wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Gamliel):</span> He should change his custom.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> He should overturn his bed</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> He need not overturn his bed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: TU B'AV AND YOM KIPPUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Gamliel):</span> There were never days as festive as the fifteenth of Av and Yom Kipur:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The girls would dress in white garments that were borrowed, so as not to embarrass those who lacked any.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>All the garments required Tevilah first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They would dance in the vineyards, and say that the men should look at their families rather than their beauty.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Pasuk speaks of Shlomo being crowned on his wedding day, which refers to the giving of the Torah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>and it speaks of the day of his heart's rejoicing, which refers to the rebuilding of the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE PRAYERS DURING WHICH THE KOHANIM BLESSED THE PEOPLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah said that the Kohanim bless the people at four times (Shacharis, Musaf, Minchah and Ne'ilah) on three occasions - fasts, Ma'amados, and Yom Kipur; but there is no Musaf on fasts and Ma'amados!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that on three occasions, the Kohanim would bless the people during every prayer, which sometimes resulted in four times.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman citing Rabah bar Avuha):</span> Such is R. Meir's opinion, but the Chachamim hold that Kohanim never bless during Minchah or Ne'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Chachamim mentioned refers to R. Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> the Kohanim bless during Shacharis, Musaf, Minchah and Ne'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> They bless during Shacharis and Musaf but not during Minchah or Ne'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> They bless during Ne'ilah but not  Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The point of contention is as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir holds that the Kohanim do not ordinarily bless during Minchah because they might be drunk, which is not a concern on these days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that since drunkenness is common on most days during the time of Minchah and Ne'ilah, the Rabanan decreed that the Kohanim should not bless at those times even on days where there is no such concern.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yosi holds that this decree was only applied to Minchah, which occurs every day, but not to Ne'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This means that he would lecture as such in public.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The people are accustomed to follow R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This means that we do not tell people to do so, but if they did, we do not make them start again.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The custom is in accordance with R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This means that he would tell people to do so if asked, but was not so confident as to publicly teach it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>The Halachah does indeed follow R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why nowadays do the Kohanim bless the people at Minchah on a Ta'anis?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it is done close to sunset, it is like doing it during Ne'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>A KOHEN MAY NOT BLESS THE PEOPLE WHILE DRUNK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> All agree that a Kohen may not bless while drunk - how do we know this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah juxtaposes the Kohen's blessing with the Nazir to teach that he is likewise forbidden to drink wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Kohen should likewise be forbidden to eat grapeskins?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk states that he should serve and bless; like someone who serves in the Beis ha'Mikdash, he may eat grapeskins.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps, like someone who serves in the Beis ha'Mikdash, he may not perform if he is blemished?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is linked to Nazir, who is not disqualified by being blemished.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why compare the Kohen to the one serving for the leniency of eating grapeskins rather than to the Nazir for the stringency of being forbidden to do so?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it is an Asmachta, it is d'Rabbanan, and therefore takes the lenient option.</p></div>
