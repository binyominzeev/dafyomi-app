<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MISHNAH: THE MA'AMADOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Kohanim bless the people at four times (Shacharis, Musaf, Minchah and Ne'ilah) on three occasions - fasts, Ma'amados, and Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The function of Ma'amados is as follows. The Torah tells everyone to bring Korbanos, but they cannot be brought in the absence of their owners.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Nevi'im therefore decreed that there be twenty-four Mishmaros of Kohanim, paralleled by twenty-four Ma'amados of Kohanim, Levi'im and Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When each Mishmar had its turn, the Kohanim and Levi'im would go to serve in the Beis ha'Mikdash and the Yisraelim would gather and read from Ma'ase Bereishis according to each day of the week.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The larger sections would be read by two people, the smaller by one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>At Shacharis, Musaf and Minchah, everyone would recite it for themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>On Erev Shabbos at Minchah it was not done, out of respect for Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> On any day where there was Hallel, there was no Ma'amad for Shacharis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On any day where there was a Korban Musaf, there was no Ma'amad for Ne'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>On any day where there was a Korban Eitzim, there was no Ma'amad for Minchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Ben Azai):</span> R. Yehoshua learned as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On any day where there was a Korban Musaf, there was no Ma'amad for Minchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>On any day where there was a Korban Eitzim, there was no Ma'amad for Ne'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Akiva retracted and followed Ben Azai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>There were nine occasions when people would donate wood for the pyres and bring Korbanos (as listed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>On the first of Teves there was no Ma'amad as there was Hallel, Korban Musaf, and a Korban Eitzim.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> NATIONAL TRAGEDIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Five calamities befell our ancestors on the Seventeenth of Tamuz:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Luchos were broken;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The bringing of the Tamid was annulled;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The walls of Jerusalem were breached;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Apostemus burned a Sefer Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>An idol was placed in the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>...and five on Tish'ah b'Av:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was decreed that our ancestors would not enter Eretz Yisrael</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The first Beis ha'Mikdash was destroyed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The second Beis ha'Mikdash was destroyed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Beitar was captured;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Jerusalem was razed to the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>From the beginning of Av, pleasure is curtailed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>During the week in which Tish'ah b'Av falls, it is forbidden to have haircuts or wash clothing, except on Thursday out of respect for Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>On Erev Tish'ah b'Av, a person may not eat two cooked foods, eat meat or drink wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Gamliel):</span> He should change his custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> He should overturn his bed</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> He need not overturn his bed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MISHNAH: TU B'AV AND YOM KIPPUR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Gamliel):</span> There were never days as festive as the fifteenth of Av and Yom Kipur:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The girls would dress in white garments that were borrowed, so as not to embarrass those who lacked any.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All the garments required Tevilah first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They would dance in the vineyards, and say that the men should look at their families rather than their beauty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Pasuk speaks of Shlomo being crowned on his wedding day, which refers to the giving of the Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>and it speaks of the day of his heart's rejoicing, which refers to the rebuilding of the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE PRAYERS DURING WHICH THE <i>KOHANIM </i>BLESSED THE PEOPLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah said that the Kohanim bless the people at four times (Shacharis, Musaf, Minchah and Ne'ilah) on three occasions - fasts, Ma'amados, and Yom Kipur; but there is no Musaf on fasts and Ma'amados!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that on three occasions, the Kohanim would bless the people during every prayer, which sometimes resulted in four times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Nachman citing Rabah bar Avuha):</span> Such is R. Meir's opinion, but the Chachamim hold that Kohanim never bless during Minchah or Ne'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Chachamim mentioned refers to R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> the Kohanim bless during Shacharis, Musaf, Minchah and Ne'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> They bless during Shacharis and Musaf but not during Minchah or Ne'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> They bless during Ne'ilah but not  Minchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The point of contention is as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir holds that the Kohanim do not ordinarily bless during Minchah because they might be drunk, which is not a concern on these days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah holds that since drunkenness is common on most days during the time of Minchah and Ne'ilah, the Rabanan decreed that the Kohanim should not bless at those times even on days where there is no such concern.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi holds that this decree was only applied to Minchah, which occurs every day, but not to Ne'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This means that he would lecture as such in public.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The people are accustomed to follow R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This means that we do not tell people to do so, but if they did, we do not make them start again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The custom is in accordance with R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This means that he would tell people to do so if asked, but was not so confident as to publicly teach it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Halachah does indeed follow R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why nowadays do the Kohanim bless the people at Minchah on a Ta'anis?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it is done close to sunset, it is like doing it during Ne'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>A <i>KOHEN </i>MAY NOT BLESS THE PEOPLE WHILE DRUNK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> All agree that a Kohen may not bless while drunk - how do we know this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah juxtaposes the Kohen's blessing with the Nazir to teach that he is likewise forbidden to drink wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Kohen should likewise be forbidden to eat grapeskins?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk states that he should serve and bless; like someone who serves in the Beis ha'Mikdash, he may eat grapeskins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps, like someone who serves in the Beis ha'Mikdash, he may not perform if he is blemished?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is linked to Nazir, who is not disqualified by being blemished.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why compare the Kohen to the one serving for the leniency of eating grapeskins rather than to the Nazir for the stringency of being forbidden to do so?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it is an Asmachta, it is d'Rabbanan, and therefore takes the lenient option.</p>
