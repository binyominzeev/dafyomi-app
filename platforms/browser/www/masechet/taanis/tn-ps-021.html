<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ILFA AND R. YOCHANAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Ilfa and R. Yochanan were in financial difficulties and decided to leave yeshivah for business.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Sitting under a ruinous wall, R. Yochanan overheard one Malach saying to another that they should push the wall onto them, as they were leaving eternal life for temporal life.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The other Malach said to leave them be as one of them was destined for great things.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Since Ilfa did not hear this, R. Yochanan concluded that they were referring to him, and returned to yeshivah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yochanan became Rosh Yeshivah; Ilfa was told that he would have earned that had he stayed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Ilfa promptly hung from a ship's mast and said that he would drown himself if unable to state the source for a Beraisa of R. Chiya and R. Oshiya in a Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>An old man challenged him with the following Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a dying man requests that his children be given a Shekel per week, and they require a Sela, then they are given a Sela.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he said "give them nothing other than a Shekel," then they are given a Shekel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he named other heirs after them, then with either phraseology they are given a Shekel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Ilfa replied that it is based on R. Meir's view that it is a mitzvah to fulfill a dead man's wishes.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>NACHUM ISH GAM-ZU</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Nachum Ish Gam-Zu was blind, lacking hands and feet, covered in boils, lying in a ruinous house, with his bed placed in water-jugs to prevent the ants reaching him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>His students wanted to rescue him from the house and then his vessels.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He told them to save the vessels first as it was his merit that was keeping it from collapsing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>As soon as they took him out, the house collapsed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>When asked why such as Tzadik was suffering so, he told them that he brought it upon himself:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>When traveling laden on a donkey, a beggar asked him for sustenance.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>He told the beggar to wait for him to dismount from the donkey, but by the time he had done so, the beggar had died.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Nachum asked that his body which had not had sufficient mercy on the other should suffer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>His students said "Woe that we have seen you so!"; he replied "Woe if you had <i>not</i> seen me so."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He was called Nachum Ish Gam-Zu as he would say about everything Gam Zu le'Tovah - this is also for the best.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The community once sent their tribute to the King - precious stones - with Nachum, because he experienced miracles.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>While staying in an inn, the innkeepers replaced the jewels with earth.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Upon being presented with the tribute, the king wanted to kill the Jews.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Nachum said "Gam Zu le'Tovah."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Eliyahu ha'Navi appeared in disguise and suggested that the earth was Avraham's miraculous earth which turned into swords.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>The king tested it successfully against another state, and sent Nachum back with jewels.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>While staying at the inn, he told them that he had been given them for that which he had brought.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>The innkeepers demolished the building and presented the king with the rubble, telling him that Nachum's earth came from there; when it did not turn into swords, they were killed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>PESTILENCE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah said that plague is defined as a city that can raise 500 troops suffering three deaths in three days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A city of 1500 men (such as Akko) and nine die in three days - this is plague.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they die in one day or four days, it is not plague.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A city of 500 men (such as Amiko) suffering three deaths in three days - this is plague.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they die in one day or four days, it is not plague.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Drokras was a city of 500 men and it suffered three deaths in a single day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Nachman bar R. Chisda decreed a fast.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> This followed R. Meir's view that if an ox is declared a Mu'ad for goring three times in three days, all the more so if it gored three times in a single day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When asked to join R. Nachman bar R. Chisda, he replied that the man honors the place rather than the place honoring the man.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We find this with Har Sinai which was sacrosanct only as long as the Shechinah was there.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Likewise, a Metzora was only forbidden to enter the camp while the Mishkan was standing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Nachman bar R. Chisda responded that he would come and join R. Nachman bar Yitzchak.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>He replied that it would be more appropriate for him to join R. Nachman bar R. Chisda, as his father was greater.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TZADIKIM SAVING THEIR CITIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>In Sura there was pestilence except in Rav's neighborhood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They thought this was due to Rav's merit, but were told in a dream that his merit is far greater than that.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, it was due to someone there who would lend digging tools for burials.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>In Drokras there was a fire, but it did not affect R. Huna's neighborhood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They thought this was due to R. Huna's merit, but were told in a dream that his merit is far greater than that.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, it was due to a woman who would heat her oven and then lend it to her neighbors.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>FORECASTING DANGER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>When told that locusts were seen, R. Yehudah decreed a fast even before any damage had occurred, as it was bound to happen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>When told that there was a disease amongst the pigs, he decreed a fast.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this mean that he holds that rampant diseases amongst one species spread to others?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it was because humans have similar anatomy to pigs and are likely to suffer from the same diseases.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>When Shmuel was told that there was an epidemic in a distant town, he decreed a fast, as there was no barrier to prevent it from spreading to his town.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>When R. Nachman was told that there was an epidemic in Eretz Yisrael, he decreed a fast in Bavel; because "when the mistress is smitten, the servant will certainly be smitten."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that no such extrapolation is to be made from one city in the Diaspora to another - why, then, did Shmuel decree a fast in his town because of an epidemic in another town?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because there were caravans traveling between the two.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>ABA THE BLOOD-LETTER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Aba the blood-letter received a Divine greeting every day, which only happened to Abaye every Erev Shabbos and to Rava every Erev Yom Kippur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Abaye was discouraged, but was told that he could not match Aba's deeds:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When treating women, Aba would cover them with a sheet and draw the blood through slits so as not to look at her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He would place the payment box in a concealed place so that those who could not afford to pay would not be embarrassed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He would treat Torah scholars for free and give them money for buying food to recuperate.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Abaye once sent a pair of scholars to investigate him; he gave them cushions to sleep on, which they took.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They met Aba at the market and asked him to evaluate the cushions, which he did.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They then owned up and asked him what he had suspected.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He replied that he had thought they needed the money to urgently redeem captives, and would no longer take the cushions back as he had already committed himself to donating them to charity.</p></div>
