<p class="dedicationbox">12TH CYCLE DEDICATION<BR>&nbsp;<BR>TA'ANIS 21 (10 Shevat) - Dedicated by Hagaon Rav Yosef Pearlman of London, England, in memory of his father in law, Harav Yeshayah ben Rav David Chaim Goldberg Z"L, who passed away on 10 Shevat 5738. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ILFA AND R. YOCHANAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Ilfa and R. Yochanan were in financial difficulties and decided to leave yeshivah for business.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Sitting under a ruinous wall, R. Yochanan overheard one Malach saying to another that they should push the wall onto them, as they were leaving eternal life for temporal life.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The other Malach said to leave them be as one of them was destined for great things.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Since Ilfa did not hear this, R. Yochanan concluded that they were referring to him, and returned to yeshivah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yochanan became Rosh Yeshivah; Ilfa was told that he would have earned that had he stayed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Ilfa promptly hung from a ship's mast and said that he would drown himself if unable to state the source for a Beraisa of R. Chiya and R. Oshiya in a Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>An old man challenged him with the following Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a dying man requests that his children be given a Shekel per week, and they require a Sela, then they are given a Sela.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said "give them nothing other than a Shekel," then they are given a Shekel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he named other heirs after them, then with either phraseology they are given a Shekel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Ilfa replied that it is based on R. Meir's view that it is a mitzvah to fulfill a dead man's wishes.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>NACHUM ISH GAM-ZU</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Nachum Ish Gam-Zu was blind, lacking hands and feet, covered in boils, lying in a ruinous house, with his bed placed in water-jugs to prevent the ants reaching him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His students wanted to rescue him from the house and then his vessels.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He told them to save the vessels first as it was his merit that was keeping it from collapsing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>As soon as they took him out, the house collapsed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>When asked why such as Tzadik was suffering so, he told them that he brought it upon himself:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When traveling laden on a donkey, a beggar asked him for sustenance.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He told the beggar to wait for him to dismount from the donkey, but by the time he had done so, the beggar had died.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Nachum asked that his body which had not had sufficient mercy on the other should suffer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>His students said "Woe that we have seen you so!"; he replied "Woe if you had <i>not</i> seen me so."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He was called Nachum Ish Gam-Zu as he would say about everything Gam Zu le'Tovah - this is also for the best.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The community once sent their tribute to the King - precious stones - with Nachum, because he experienced miracles.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>While staying in an inn, the innkeepers replaced the jewels with earth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Upon being presented with the tribute, the king wanted to kill the Jews.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Nachum said "Gam Zu le'Tovah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Eliyahu ha'Navi appeared in disguise and suggested that the earth was Avraham's miraculous earth which turned into swords.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>The king tested it successfully against another state, and sent Nachum back with jewels.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>While staying at the inn, he told them that he had been given them for that which he had brought.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>The innkeepers demolished the building and presented the king with the rubble, telling him that Nachum's earth came from there; when it did not turn into swords, they were killed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PESTILENCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that plague is defined as a city that can raise 500 troops suffering three deaths in three days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A city of 1500 men (such as Akko) and nine die in three days - this is plague.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they die in one day or four days, it is not plague.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A city of 500 men (such as Amiko) suffering three deaths in three days - this is plague.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they die in one day or four days, it is not plague.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Drokras was a city of 500 men and it suffered three deaths in a single day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Nachman bar R. Chisda decreed a fast.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> This followed R. Meir's view that if an ox is declared a Mu'ad for goring three times in three days, all the more so if it gored three times in a single day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When asked to join R. Nachman bar R. Chisda, he replied that the man honors the place rather than the place honoring the man.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We find this with Har Sinai which was sacrosanct only as long as the Shechinah was there.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Likewise, a Metzora was only forbidden to enter the camp while the Mishkan was standing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Nachman bar R. Chisda responded that he would come and join R. Nachman bar Yitzchak.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He replied that it would be more appropriate for him to join R. Nachman bar R. Chisda, as his father was greater.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>TZADIKIM</i> SAVING THEIR CITIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>In Sura there was pestilence except in Rav's neighborhood.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They thought this was due to Rav's merit, but were told in a dream that his merit is far greater than that.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, it was due to someone there who would lend digging tools for burials.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In Drokras there was a fire, but it did not affect R. Huna's neighborhood.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They thought this was due to R. Huna's merit, but were told in a dream that his merit is far greater than that.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, it was due to a woman who would heat her oven and then lend it to her neighbors.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>FORECASTING DANGER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>When told that locusts were seen, R. Yehudah decreed a fast even before any damage had occurred, as it was bound to happen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>When told that there was a disease amongst the pigs, he decreed a fast.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this mean that he holds that rampant diseases amongst one species spread to others?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it was because humans have similar anatomy to pigs and are likely to suffer from the same diseases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>When Shmuel was told that there was an epidemic in a distant town, he decreed a fast, as there was no barrier to prevent it from spreading to his town.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When R. Nachman was told that there was an epidemic in Eretz Yisrael, he decreed a fast in Bavel; because "when the mistress is smitten, the servant will certainly be smitten."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that no such extrapolation is to be made from one city in the Diaspora to another - why, then, did Shmuel decree a fast in his town because of an epidemic in another town?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because there were caravans traveling between the two.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>ABA THE BLOOD-LETTER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Aba the blood-letter received a Divine greeting every day, which only happened to Abaye every Erev Shabbos and to Rava every Erev Yom Kippur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Abaye was discouraged, but was told that he could not match Aba's deeds:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When treating women, Aba would cover them with a sheet and draw the blood through slits so as not to look at her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He would place the payment box in a concealed place so that those who could not afford to pay would not be embarrassed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He would treat Torah scholars for free and give them money for buying food to recuperate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Abaye once sent a pair of scholars to investigate him; he gave them cushions to sleep on, which they took.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They met Aba at the market and asked him to evaluate the cushions, which he did.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They then owned up and asked him what he had suspected.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He replied that he had thought they needed the money to urgently redeem captives, and would no longer take the cushions back as he had already committed himself to donating them to charity.</p>
