<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Masna):</span> It is the day on which the dead of Beitar were allowed to be buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On that day, they established the Berachah of ha'Tov (that the bodies had not decomposed) ve'ha'Meitiv (that they were allowed to bury them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Raba & R. Yosef):</span> It was the day on which they stopped chopping wood for the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer ha'Gadol):</span> From the fifteenth of Av, the sun's strength wanes, and they stopped cutting wood for the pyre as it wouldn't dry properly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It was called the axe-breaking day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>From this point on, whoever adds on to his night-time Torah study will have years added to his life.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One who does not do so will be gathered in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>This means that his mother will bury him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DANCE OF THE UNMARRIED GIRLS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that the girls would borrow clothing from each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A princess would borrow from the Kohen Gadol's daughter, her from the deputy Kohen Gadol's daughter, her from the daugher of the Kohen of war, her from the daughter of another Kohen, and other girls from everyone else, so as not to embarrass whoever did not have.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Mishnah said that all the garments required Tevilah first; this was true even if they were folded in a closet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Mishnah said that they would dance in the vineyards; those who lacked wives would go there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The beautiful ones would tell them to pay attention to beauty, as a wife is for her beauty.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Those with Yichus would tell them to pay attention to that, as a wife is for her children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The ugly ones would tell them to marry for the sake of Heaven, and to adorn their wives with golden jewelry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Hash-m is destined to make a circle of Tzadikim; He will sit inside, and they will point, as the Pasuk refers to them saying "This is my G-d, we will rejoice in His salvation."</p>
