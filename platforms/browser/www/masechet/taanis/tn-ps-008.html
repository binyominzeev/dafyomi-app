<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>BLUNTED IRON (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If a Talmid Chacham is finding his studies as hard as iron, it is because he hasn't prepared his Mishnah properly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The solution is for him to increase his time in yeshivah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He is in all the better a position if he has prepared his Mishnah properly in the first place.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Reish Lakish would prepare his Mishnayos forty times, paralleling the forty days that Moshe spent learning the Torah, before going to study under R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Ada bar Ahava would prepare his Mishnayos twenty-four times, paralleling the books of tenach, before going to study under Rava.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a student finds his studies as hard as iron, it is because his teacher is not treating him well.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>the solution is for him to amass friends.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>He is in all the better a position if his deeds please his teacher in the first place.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE NACHASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> A Pasuk refers to the Nachash biting because of Lachash. This means...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the skies are as rusty as copper (Nechoshes), not giving rain, it is because there are none who pray the silent Amidah (Lachash).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The solution is to find someone who knows how to pray it.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If he prays and is not answered, they should go to the Chasid of the generation for his intervention.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>If he prays, is answered, and grows conceited as a result, he brings anger to the world.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If two Talmidei Chachamim in a city do not cooperate in Halachah, they bring anger to the world.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The Pasuk refers to a future assembly of all the animals with the snake, where they will challenge him as to what benefit he receives from biting others, since he doesn't eat them.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The snake responds that he is like the slanderer, who also receives no benefit.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>GOOD QUALITIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> A person's prayer is only heard if he places his soul in his hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel showed that even if prayer is utterly insincere, it is answered!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is referring to the prayer of a congregation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> The rain falls in the merit of those who possess integrity.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We see how great such people are from the story of the Chuldah and the well.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If someone who places his trust in a Chuldah and a well succeeds, how much more so someone who places his trust in Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Anyone who conducts himself with righteous precision on earth will receive the same judgment Above (i.e. strict judging of his sins in order to cleanse him). (There is a dispute as to which Pasuk this is learned from.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua b. Levi):</span> Anyone who rejoices in his suffering brings salvation to the world.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>RAIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> When the Heavens are stopped up from giving rain, it is like a woman who has labor pains but cannot give birth.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah uses the word Atzirah (stopping up) with both the Heavens and women.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Torah uses the word Leidah (giving birth) with both the Heavens and women.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Torah uses the word Pekidah (marking down for giving birth) with both the Heavens and women.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>One of these Pesukim refers to a container in the atmosphere from where the rains come.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> A Pasuk teaches us that if harsh rain was decreed but Israel repented, it will fall harmlessly on the mountains or on trees; if good rain was decreed, it will fall on fields and cisterns etc.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In his generation there was both famine and plague.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The people said that they cannot pray to be saved from both, so they opted to pray for release from plague.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shmuel bar Nachmani told them to pray to be saved from famine, as Hash-m grants sustenance for people to live (and they will have to be saved from plague too).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>We know that we cannot pray for two things from a Pasuk about praying for one request, implying that another request was not prayed for.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>In R. Zeira's generation the government issued decrees against the Jews, including one that they must not fast.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Zeira instructed the people to pledge to fast, and to carry it out when the decree would be revoked.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He knew to do this from a Pasuk about Daniel's prayer being answered from when he <i>decided</i> to fast.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Even in years as parched as those of Eliyahu, rain on Erev Shabbos is a bad sign.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Shila):</span> The day of rainfall is as harsh (noisy) as the days of (Beis Din sitting in) judgment.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> If it was not that we needed the rain, we would pray that it be cancelled.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Sun on Shabbos is charity for the poor.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE GREATNESS OF RAIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> The day of rainfall is so great that even non-rain-related works are blessed on it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Berachah only occurs in that which is concealed from the eye (i.e. whose amount is not known).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who enters his granary to measure it should pray that his work receives blessing; once he has started to measure it, he blesses Hash-m for sending blessing upon it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he measured it and said the Berachah afterwards, it is in vain, as blessing cannot happen to items measured, only to those things concealed from the eye.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The day of rainfall is as great as that of the ingathering of the exiles.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The day of rainfall is so great that even army troops halt on it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rain is withheld because of those who promise to donate charity in public and fail to do so.</p></div>
