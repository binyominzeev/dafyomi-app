<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p><i>MISHNAH:</i> EVENTS WHICH INVOKE THE FASTS (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A city which suffered pestilence or collapsing buildings sounds the Shofar and fasts, and the surrounding cities fast but do not sound the Shofar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> The surrounding cities should sound the Shofar but not fast.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Pestilence is defined as a city that can produce 500 troops suffering three deaths in three days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The procedure is begun in all cities if one city experienced plagues on the produce, locusts, attacks of wild animals, or invaders.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The elders once decreed a fast because a quantity of crop plague was seen in Ashkelon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A fast was once decreed because wolves ate two children beyond the Yarden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> The wolves did not eat anyone; they were merely seen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The procedure is begun even on Shabbos for a city surrounded by troops or flooded, and for a storm-tossed ship.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> The Shofar is only sounded as a call for aid, but not for prayer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shimon haTeimani):</span> The procedure is also done for pestilence.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> This is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The procedure is done to remove all types of trouble, except for too much rain.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Choni ha'Me'agel was asked to pray for rain, but was not answered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He stood in a circle and vowed not to move until rain fell.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Originally it fell too lightly; then too heavily; then just right.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Even when enough had fallen, he refused to pray that it should stop.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Shimon benhetach sent a message that for anyone else to do this would be entirely inappropriate, but Choni was beloved by the One Above like one loves his own child.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>If the people were fasting and rain fell, theny they should complete their fast only if it fell after dawn.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> They should complete their fast only if it fell after midday.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Once, when the people were fasting in Lod, rain fell before midday. R. Tarfon told them to eat and celebrate, and they recited Hallel in the afternoon.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>STARTING THE FASTING PROCESS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah said that the procedure of fasting applies to where the first rainfall did not occur; but a Beraisa states that the first two rainfalls are to be asked for, and only the third is to be fasted for!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means to say that it applies to where the sequence of the first three rainfalls did not occur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Mishnah continues that if the crops were malformed, the procedure is begun immediately.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman):</span> This is only true if they were malformed, but not if they were dry, as then there is no hope for improvement.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious - the Mishnah only spoke of malformed crops!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to where the seeds recovered so far as to produce stalks.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that this is enough of a sign of recovery to justify fasting, so R. Nachman tells us that it is still pointless.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DEARTH AND FAMINE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah said that if there was a cessation of rain for forty days between rainfalls, the procedure is begun, as it is a punishment of dearth.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This means that it is a punishment which <i>leads</i> to dearth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman):</span> If a city lacks produce and has to import it by river, it is dearth; if it has to be imported from a different country, it is famine.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> If a Se'ah can be bought for a Sela and it is common, this is dearth; if four Se'ah can be bought for a Sela but it is not common, this is famine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This refers to where currency is plentiful and fruit is expensive; but if currency is expensive and fruit is plentiful, the procedure is begun immediately.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"I remember when four Se'ah could be purchased for a Sela, yet people were swollen from starvation in Tiverya because there was no currency."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>RAIN THAT IS SOMEWHAT BENEFICIAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah said that the procedure is started immediately if rain that benefits only plants, trees or cisterns fell.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rain that benefits plants but not trees is rain that falls gently but not hard.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rain that benefits trees but not plants is rain that falls hard but not gently.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rain that benefits plants and trees but not cisterns is rain that falls both gently and hard but not in large quantities.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is it possible to have rain that is good for cisterns but not for plants and trees?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When it falls overly powerfully.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The procedure is begun even during Pesach if rain had not fallen for trees.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is begun even during Sukkos if rain had not fallen for the cisterns.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is begun immediately if there is no drinking water.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Immediately" means on the ensuing Monday, Thursday and Monday.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>All these apply only to the place where they happened.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>For Askara (croup) the procedure is done only if it is fatal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>For Gubai-locusts the procedure is done even if for the smallest quantity.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Elazar):</span> This is also true for Chagav-locusts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The procedure is done for trees in the first six years of the Shemittah cycle alone; for cisterns, even in Shemittah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Gamliel):</span> It is done for trees even in Shemittah, as the poor require them for their sustenance.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Another Beraisa states similarly, referring to free-growing trees.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE PATTERN OF RAIN NOWADAYS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Since the destruction of the Beis ha'Mikdash, the rains do not fall as freely.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>In some years they are plentiful, in others scarce; in some years they fall in their proper time, in others not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A year when they fall in their proper time is like a servant being paid on Sunday; he has time to bake his bread for Shabbos properly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A year when they do not fall in their proper time is like a servant being paid on Erev Shabbos; he does not have time to bake his bread for Shabbos properly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A year with plentiful rain is like a servant receiving his payment all in one go so that only one lot of flour is absorbed by the mill (and similarly, the rain-water is absorbed by the earth and the wind only once).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>A year when there is insufficient rain is like a servant who receives his sustenance little by little, so that each time he kneads, he loses more flour (and so it is with the rain-water).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Alternative metaphor):</span> It is like a person mixing cement; he needs ample water to mix it properly.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE STORY OF NAKDIMON BEN GURYON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Once during the pilgrimage there was no drinking water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Nakdimon b. Guryon borrowed twelve cisterns of water from a Roman nobleman against twelve Kikar of silver if it was not repaid by a certain day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>When the morning of the given date arrived, then midday, and then late afternoon, and no rain came, he kept telling the Roman that there was still time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Roman scoffed that if had not rained the whole year, it certainly wouldn'y rain now.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>He happily went to the bathhouse while Nakdimon sadly went to the Beis Hamikdash.</p></div>
