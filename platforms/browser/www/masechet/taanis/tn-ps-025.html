<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CHANINA'S MIRACLES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Every day a Divine voice states that the world is sustained in the merit of Chanina b. Dosa, who suffices with a Kav of carobs weekly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>His wife would heat the oven and put smoke-emitting substances in it so the neighbors wouldn't realize that they could not afford bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An inquisitive neighbor went to investigate, and she went to hide out of shame.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The neighbor saw the oven full of bread, and called for her to bring a shovel to remove it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>She replied that she had gone to get one, and she indeed had, as she was accustomed to miracles.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>She complained that there was no food, so Chanina told her to pray.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m gave her the leg of a golden stool, but she complained after seeing in a dream that all the Tzadikim had a three-legged stool and theirs had only two legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>After praying, it was removed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The latter miracle was greater, as things are given but not taken away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One Erev Shabbos, Chanina saw his daughter distraught because she had lit with vinegar instead of oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He told her that the One Who makes oil burn can just as easily make vinegar burn.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It burned through the day and provided light for Havdalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>His goats were accused of causing trouble.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He said that if that were true, then they should be eaten by bears, otherwise they should bring bears impaled on their horns, which is what happened.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>His neighbor's house had beams that were too short. He blessed them and they were miraculously extended.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Others say that they miraculously had pieces added on.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> How did he come to have goats if he was so poor?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Surely it is forbidden to raise small domestic animals in Eretz Yisrael?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His wife once found some chickens that someone had left on their doorstep.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chanina hatched their eggs, and sold the chickens for goats.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When the owner returned, he gave him the goats.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE SLEEP OF R. ELAZAR OF PEDAS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Elazar b. Pedas was very poor. After blood-letting, he had nothing to eat except garlic, whereupon he fainted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The rabbis found him in his sleep, laughing and crying, with light emitting from his forehead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Upon awaking, he told them that Hash-m had offered to destroy the world on the chance that he would be reborn wealthy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But he did not want to take the risk, since he was also told that he had already lived more than half his life.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>As a reward, he would be given 13 rivers of Afarsamon oil in the next world, but nothing else, so as to leave for others.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When he said that Hash-m was not limited, He tapped him on the head.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TECHNIQUES FOR BRINGING RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Chama bar Chanina decreed a fast but no rain fell.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When challenged that R. Yehoshua b. Levi was able to bring rain, he replied that R. Yehoshua was clearly superior.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They suggested that everyone concentrate and perhaps they would become contrite, but their prayers were still unanswered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He called to the skies to become cloudy, but nothing happened.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He accused them of being brazen, and rain came.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Levi decreed a fast but no rain came.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He said that Hash-m had ascended to Heaven and was not showing mercy upon His children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rain fell, and Levi became lame.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Never reproach Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was not it due to Levi having done a certain type of press-up that made him lame?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both were factors.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Chiya bar Lulayni overheard clouds saying that they would rain on Ammon and Moav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He protested to Hash-m that nations which refused the Torah should not receive rain, and rain fell on the Jews instead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>He explained that the Pasuk compares a Tzadik to both a date-palm and a cedar because the trunk of the latter grows back (Techiyas ha'Meisim) and the former produces fruit (like reward in the next world).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that the trunk of a cedar does not grow back:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who buys a tree to cut it down, must do so a certain distance from the ground for certain trees;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>For other trees, such as cedars, he can remove the roots, as they will not grow back anyway.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to a different type of cedar; there are ten types.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Eliezer once decreed thirteen fasts but no rain fell.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the people were finally leaving, he asked them if they had dug graves; their weeping brought rain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>On a different occasion, he said the twenty-four Berachos but was not answered, and R. Akiva said two Avinu Malkeinu's and was answered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The rabbis were suspicious of him, but a Bas-Kol said that it was not that R. Akiva was greater, rather that he was willing to overlook wrongs against him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN TO STOP FASTING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> People should stop fasting for rain when enough has fallen...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> To penetrate the cavity made by a plough.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> To penetrate a Tefach in dry land, two in regular land, and three in tilled land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Elazar):</span> For every Tefach of rain that penetrates the earth, three Tefachim rise from the depths.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa states that two rise?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to tilled earth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> When the water libation is done on Sukos, the depths call to each other to pour forth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah saw Ridayah, the Malach of rain, who looked like a cow with a split lip, standing between the upper and lower Tehomos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He told the upper to pour down and the lower to spring forth.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>COMPLETING THE FAST AFTER RAINFALL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the people were fasting and rain fell...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> They complete their fast only if it fell after sunrise.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> They complete it only if it fell after midday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> They complete it only if it fell after nine hours, as we find that Achav only ate at the ninth hour.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah the Nasi decreed a fast, and even though rain fell after sunrise, he thought to complete the fast, but was told that midday is the demarcation point.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Shmuel ha'Katan decreed a fast and rain fell before sunrise.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The people wanted to take credit for it, but he compared it to a master who gives in to his slave's request rather than hear his voice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>On another occasion, Shmuel ha'Katan decreed a fast and rain fell after sunset.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The people wanted to take credit for it, but he compared it to a master who delays giving in to his slave's request so as to make him suffer and be contrite.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When would Shmuel ha'Katan consider rain to reflect well on the people?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it fell as soon as they said that Hash-m brings rain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Mishnah said that once, when the people were fasting in Lod, rain fell before midday; R. Tarfon told them to eat and celebrate, and they recited Hallel in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did not they say Hallel before feasting?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hallel is only said on a full stomach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When R. Papa's fast was answered before midday, they said Hallel and feasted afterwards!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In that town, drunkenness was common, and if they feasted first, they might have been unable to say Hallel.</p>
