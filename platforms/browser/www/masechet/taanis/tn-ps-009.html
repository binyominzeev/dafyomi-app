<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>R. YOCHANAN AND RESH LAKISH'S SON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Pasuk of "Aser t'Aser" teaches us to give Ma'aser so that we should grow wealthy (Ashir).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan asked Reish Lakish's son to tell him the Pasuk that he had just learned, and he replied with this Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He asked R. Yochanan to explain it, and he gave this explanation.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>When asked to explain how he knew it, R. Yochanan told him to test Hash-m on it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The boy challenged him with a Pasuk that we may not test Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Yochanan cited R. Hoshaya that this case is an exception, as seen in a Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>The boy replied that had he reached that Pasuk, he wouldn't have needed R. Yochanan and R. Hoshaya's explanation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yochanan found Reish Lakish's son saying a Pasuk from Mishlei about a person sinning, coming to harm, and not acknowledging why it happened.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan mused that there must be a Pasuk in Chumash alluding to this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish's son replied that the episode of Yosef's brothers in Egypt alludes to it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yochanan lifted up his eyelids to look at the intelligent boy, whereupon his mother took him away, so that R. Yochanan's look should not kill him as it did his father.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE MERIT THAT BRINGS RAIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Rain falls in the merit of an individual, but general sustenance only comes in the merit of many.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that general sustenance comes in the merit of an individual:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(R. Yosi b. R. Yehudah) Israel had three good providers: Moshe, in whose benefit there was Man, Aharon, in whose benefit were the Clouds of Glory, and Miriam, in whose benefit there was the well.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When Miriam died, the well disappeared, but it returned in the merit of Moshe and Aharon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>When Aharon died, the Clouds of Glory disappeared.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Canaan heard that Aharon had died and the Clouds of Glory had disappeared, and presumed that he now had a right to fight Israel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Likewise, the Pasuk about Israel seeing that Aharon died can also be read as them being exposed <i>because</i> Aharon died.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>This follows Reish Lakish's teaching that "Ki" can mean if, perhaps, rather, and because.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>The Clouds of Glory and the well returned in the merit of Moshe.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>When Moshe died, they all disappeared, as we see from a Pasuk speaking about three shepherds being cut off in a single month.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moshe is different because he was requesting these things on behalf of many people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>When Rava died, his students went to R. Papa. They would signal to each other when he said something that they disagreed with.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He was disheartened and dreamt of the Pasuk of three shepherds being cut off.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The next day, he told them to go in peace, so that the dream would be harmlessly fulfilled through the farewell greeting.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Shimi bar Ashi would ask R. Papa many questions. One day he saw him lying down and praying to be saved from the shame he was causing him, so he kept silent from then on.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Reish Lakish also held that rain falls in the merit of an individual, even if he only needs it for a single field or even a single plant, as learned from a Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An example is R. Daniel bar Katina, who would tour his garden daily and say which rows required water, and it would rain on those rows.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Pasuk says that "Hash-m makes Chazizim" - what does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that Hash-m makes a separate Chaziz for each Tzadik.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Chazizim?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Porchos.; they signify approaching rain.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Porchos?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Light clouds beneath thick clouds.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Fine rain before regular rain means that the rains will last a long time; fine rain after regular rain means that the rains will stop.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Siman for the former is a sieve; the Siman for the latter is goat dung.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Ula went to Bavel and saw Porchos clouds; he warned people to clear away their goods, but it did not rain.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He noted that just as Babylonians lie, so do their clouds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Ula went to Bavel and saw a basket of dates for a zuz; he wondered why people were not studying Torah if food was so cheap.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But when he suffered ill effects from eating them, he wondered that they were able to study at all, considering the ill effects of abundant food.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE BERAISA ABOUT THE SOURCE OF RAIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> The world drinks from the ocean, as we see from the Pasuk that "a mist went up and watered the ground."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehoshua):</span> Surely seawater is salty?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is sweetened in the clouds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> The world drinks from the Upper Waters, as we see from the Pasuk that it "drinks from the water of the Heavens."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Pasuk about a mist going up refers to the clouds rising and accepting water from above</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They then rain on the ground, a hairsbreadth between each drop.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This teaches that the day of rainfall is as great as the day that the Heavens and Earth were created (as per Daf 2a).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Pasuk of "He waters the mountains from His upper chambers," explained to refer to the chambers of Hash-m, goes according to R. Yehoshua.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer would counter that when the water rises up there, it is referred to as the upper chambers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We see that such an explanation exists from the Pasuk about dust and ashes falling from the Heavens.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Pasuk of Hash-m filling the storehouses with the depths goes according to R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehoshua would counter that that is referring to the creation of the world.</p></div>
