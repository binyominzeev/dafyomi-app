<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE EXTRA <i>BERACHOS</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that the Berachah about Shmuel would conclude with Shome'a Tze'akah, while that about Eliyahu would conclude with Shome'a Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Some switch these around.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is understandable that both versions exist with Shmuel, as the Pasuk uses both terms, but with Eliyahu there is no mention of Tze'akah!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk of Aneini is a form of Tze'akah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Seeing as Yonah lived after David and Shlomo, why is the Berachah about him mentioned first?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As we want the final Berachah to conclude with a mention of Eretz Yisrael (which is what David and Shlomo prayed about).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Others, however, do not conclude that Berachah with a mention of Eretz Yisrael, but with "Blessed is He that humbles the haughty."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The reason why it was ruled that the men of the Mishmar may drink wine by night but not by day is in case the men of the Beis Av require their assistance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The reason why it was ruled that the men of the Beis Av may never drink wine is that they are engaged in constant duty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Based on this, it was ruled that nowadays, any Kohen who knows which is his Mishmar, his Beis Av, and which days they worked, may not drink wine that day (in case Mashiach comes).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he knows his Mishmar but not his Beis Av, but he knows that his Beis Av did work in the Beis ha'Mikdash, then he may not drink wine all that week.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he does not knows his Mishmar or his Beis Av, but he knows that his Beis Av did work in the Beis ha'Mikdash, then he may not drink wine all year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> With this reasoning, every Kohen should always be forbidden to drink wine, in case all the Kohanim are needed for the Chanukas ha'Bayis; but we see that all these concerns have been disregarded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Kohanim nowadays that drink wine are following Rebbi's view.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HAIRCUTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that the men of the Mishmar and of the Ma'amad may not have haircuts or wash their clothes except on Thursday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To ensure that they do it beforehand and do not begin their work looking slovenly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A king should have his hair cut every day; a Kohen Gadol every Erev Shabbos; and a Kohen Hedyot every thirty days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A king should have his hair cut every day as the Pasuk says that he should be beheld in his beauty.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Kohen Gadol should have his hair cut every Erev Shabbos since that is when the Mishmaros are renewed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Kohen Hedyot should have his hair cut every thirty days as derived from the identical use of the word Pera with Nazir, who has his hair cut after thirty days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the Nazir has his hair cut after thirty days?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An unspecified Nezirus is usually for that period.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk says Yihiyeh (he will be) which is of Gematriya 30.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe the Pasuk means that he should not grow his hair long at all?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The wording of the Pasuk means that the long hair may not be grown any longer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HAIRCUTS NOWADAYS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is thus derived from a Pasuk, should not it also apply nowadays?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is similar to the prohibition against drinking wine, which only applies at a time when the Beis ha'Mikdash can be entered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that only a lone opinion permits drinking wine nowadays:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> Every Kohen should always be forbidden to drink wine, in case all the Kohanim are needed for the Chanukas ha'Bayis; but we see that all these concerns have been disregarded.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Kohanim nowadays that drink wine are following Rebbi's view.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The implication is that the Rabanan forbid Kohanim to drink wine even nowadays!?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The reason for the ban on wine is in case the Beis ha'Mikdash is suddenly rebuilt and the Kohen's services are required, so that he should not be incapacitated; but if he has unkempt hair, he can simply have a haircut immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely with wine there is also a solution of him sleeping a little, as it was said that walking a Mil and the slightest amount of sleep remove the effect of wine?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That statement was qualified as referring only to where a Revi'is was drunk; but if more than that was drunk, walking and sleeping exacerbate its effects.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Inebriation, which is Mechalel the work in the Beis ha'Mikdash, was subject to decree; unkempt hair was not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that unkempt hair is Mechalel and therefore should be subject to the decree:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Kohen who is drunk or has unkempt hair is subject to death at the hand of Heaven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Drunkenness is explicitly prohibited in the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Unkempt hair is linked by a Pasuk in Yechezkel to drunkenness, and is thereby also liable for the death penalty.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Likewise, just as drunkenness is Mechalel the work, so is having unkempt hair!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is only compared regarding the death penalty, but not regarding being Mechalel the work.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is learned from Yechezkel, who established the rule before Yechezkel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see that that line of argument doesn't work:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> The rule that a Kohen who is uncircumcised because Milah killed his brothers may not serve, is learned from a Pasuk in Yechezkel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Until Yechezkel said it, it was known as a tradition; he merely provided Scriptural support.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Similarly here, it was a tradition that unkempt hair is liable for the death penalty, and Yechezkel provided Scriptural support.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MEGILAS TA'ANIS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that any day listed in Megilas Ta'anis as forbidden for Hespedim is also prohibited on the preceding day but not on the following day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are some days that have been designated as forbidden for fasting, and some of these are also forbidden for Hespedim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From the first until the eighth of Nisan, when it was successfully proved that the Tamid must be communally brought, it is forbidden for Hespedim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>From the eighth until the end of Yom Tov, when it was successfully proved that the Omer is counted from the day after Pesach, it is forbidden for Hespedim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was it necessary to include the first of Nisan - it is anyway Rosh Chodesh and forbidden for Hespedim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was necessary so as to also forbid the preceding day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is not the preceding day anyway forbidden as being the day before Rosh Chodesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rosh Chodesh is d'Oraisa and does not require such reinforcement:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The festive days listed in Megilas Taanis are forbidden for fasting on the days preceding and following them as well.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>With Shabbos and Yom Tov, one may fast on the preceding and following days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The reason is that the latter are d'Oraisa, which do not need reinforcement, whereas the former are d'Rabbanan and need reinforcement.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was it necessary to include through to the end of Pesach - it is anyway Yom Tov and forbidden for Hespedim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was necessary so as to also forbid the following day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This follows R. Yosi's view that the days both preceding and following the days in Megilas Ta'anis are forbidden for Hespedim.</p>
