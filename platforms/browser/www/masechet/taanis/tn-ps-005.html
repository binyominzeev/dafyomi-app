<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: WHEN TO STOP ASKING FOR RAIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We ask for rain until...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Until Pesach has passed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> Until Nisan has passed, as we see in a Pasuk that Yoreh (the early rains) and Malkosh (the late rains) fall in Nisan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE EARLY RAINS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yoreh falls in Cheshvan!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is referring to the era of Yoel b. Pesuel, when the first rains fell on the first of Nisan, and the prophet told the people to sow the remaining grain; the second rainfall was on the fifth, and the Omer was brought eleven days later.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is alluded to by the Pasuk of "Those who sow in tears..."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> "...going and weeping... coming in joy" refers to the ox weeping as it ploughs, and eating sprouting vegetation on its way back.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> "bearing the sheaves" refers to the ears of grain being twice the size of the stalks.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>EXPLANATIONS OF VARIOUS PESUKIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Pasuk refers to a seven-year famine - how did the people survive?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the first year, they ate what they had in the houses; in the second year, what was in the fields; in the third year, kosher animals; in the fourth year, non-kosher animals; in the fifth year, vermin and insects; in the sixth year, the flesh of their children; in the seventh year, their own arms.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the Pasuk of "It is holy in your midst, I shall not come to the city" refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m is saying that He shall not enter the Jerusalem of Above until He has entered the Jerusalem of below.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We know that there is a Jerusalem above as a Pasuk refers to the companion of Jerusalem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the Pasuk of "They shall burn with one..." refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One sin - idolatry - causes wicked people to burn in Gehinom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Pasuk refers to two sins having being committed - but surely twenty-four were enumerated?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means one sin which is as bad as two - idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Pasuk refers to the Kutiyim worshiping fire, even though they know that the Kedrayim's god of water extinguishes it, yet the Jews have replaced their G-d with something useless.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can the Pasuk refer to Shmuel growing old, seeing as he died at 52?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He aged prematurely, regretting that he had appointed Shaul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He asked that, like Moshe and Aharon, his successor should outlive him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Hash-m noted that He could not kill Shaul, as Shmuel did not want that; nor could He simply kill Shmuel, as people will think badly of him for having died young; not could He let them both live, as David's kingship was due to begin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Therefore, He made Shmuel age prematurely.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>This explains the Pasuk speaking of Shaul in Givah and Ramah - it refers to the two and a half years that Shaul reigned in Givah due to the prayer of  Shmuel ha'Ramasi.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We see in a Pasuk that one person's life can be cut short on account of another.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>R. NACHMAN AND R. YITZCHAK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Nachman was asked by R. Yitzchak at a meal to speak, but replied that one should not do so because one might choke.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Afterwards, he said:</span> "Yaakov did not die."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yitzchak asked, "Did they mourn, embalm and bury him for nothing?"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He answered that nevertheless a Pasuk compares him to his descendants, that they are both still alive.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Anyone who says "Rachav, Rachav!" (the name of a harlot) becomes a Baal Keri.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R Nachman asked that he can say it without suffering that consequence.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yitzchak explained that he was referring to someone who is familiar with her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>When they parted, R. Nachman asked R. Yitzchak for a blessing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yitzchak gave the parable of a starving traveller who benefits from a tree, and can bless it only that its descendants should be as wonderful as it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In the same way, R. Nachman, who already had Torah, wealth, and children, could only be blessed that his descendants should turn out like him.</p></div>
