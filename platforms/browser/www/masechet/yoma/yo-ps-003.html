<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ESTABLISHING YOM KIPPUR AS THE ONLY DAY WITH PERISHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the day is Shavuos (one to seven)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We connect a day with one Ayil (Miluim) with another (Yom ha'Kipurim), not with two Aylim (by Shavuos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what of the opinion of R. Elazar b. R. Shimon that Yom ha'Kipurim has two Aylim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even so, one is an obligation of the day, and one is a Musaf, as opposed to Shavuos where both are Chovas ha'Yom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the day is Rosh ha'Shanah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We connect the days where the animals come from the pocket of the one offering (Miluim and Yom ha'Kipurim), not where they come from communal coffers (Rosh ha'Shanah).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what of the opinion that the Miluim came from communal funds?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that Kach L'cha and Asei L'cha mean from your personal funds.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yoshiyah):</span> ve'Yikchu Elecha means communal funds.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>(R. Yonasan) Kach Lecha and ve'Yikchu Elecha mean communal funds. When it says "Kach L'cha by the Ketores," it does not mean communal funds. Rather, it means that so to speak, Hash-m prefers the personal Ketores of Moshe Rabeinu to that of Bnei Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There seem to be contradictory Pesukim regarding the funding source of the Aron?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When Yisrael does His will, the Aron is credited to them; if not (after the Egel) it is credited to Moshe.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The dispute pertains to unspecified Kichos (like by the Ketores) and Asiyos (like the Chatzotzros), not by specified Kichos like the Miluim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>The source for personal funds by Miluim is Vayikra 9:3.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>The source by Yom ha'Kipurim is Vayikra 16:3.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We connect days with one Chatas and one Olah and not days (Shavuos and Rosh ha'Shanah) where both are Olos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> We connect days where the Avodah is done by the Kohen Gadol (excluding all other days).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer #3:</span> We connect Avodah Techilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Techilah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Avodah is done by the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that is the same as Answer #3?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means the Kohen enters the first time.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ONE PERISHAH OR TWO?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> There is one Perishah (Yom ha'Kipurim- "La'asos Lechaper").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Dimi citing R. Yehoshua b. Levi):</span> There are two Perishos (Parah- "La'asos"; Yom ha'Kipurim- "Lechaper").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah teaches that there are two?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is only a stringency by Parah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yochanan learned two Perishos from the Pesukim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was his Rebbi's opinion, not his own (as we find him elsewhere citing this position as R. Yishmael's).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>R. YOCHANAN AND RESH LAKISH ON THE SOURCE OF PERISHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Resh Lakish of R. Yochanan):</span> It appears that the Perishah before Yom ha'Kipurim is Me'akev, as it is by Miluim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>And if so... why does our Mishnah speak of Mesaknin a substitute Kohen, it should say Mafrishin!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>And if they both mean the same thing, then why does the Mishnah switch words?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Resh Lakish's source?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moshe's segregation before going up to Har Sinai.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is found in Shemos 24:17.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Hash-m calls Moshe on the seventh day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This establishes a six day segregation before any encounter with the Shechinah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But our Mishnah teaches <i>seven</i> days?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah is the opinion of R. Yehudah b. Beseira who reckons with the possibility of <i>Tum'as</i> Beiso.</p></div>
