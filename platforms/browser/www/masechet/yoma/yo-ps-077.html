<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>AGADA: GAVRIEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mal'ach Gavriel reported to Daniel "va'Ani Basi bi'Devarecha".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>As derived from the Pesukim in Yechezkel, Gavriel had been expelled from among the Mal'achim for improperly carrying out his agency.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He should have either not executed the decree against K'lal Yisrael (anticipating a reprieve); or,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He should have carried it out exactly, and not cooled the flames somewhat by having the K'ruv deliver the coals instead of taking them directly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Although by doing so, Gavriel saved the remnant of Klal Yisrael, he was punished with 60 lashes of fire and expelled.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>During the 21 days of his absence, the Mal'ach Dubiel, Sar of the Persians, took his place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>When Dubiel tried to exact a terrible price from his new status, that of taxing even the Talmidei Chachamim, Gavriel called out from Achorei ha'Pargod that they do not deserve this, given that all of their scholars combined do not equal Daniel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This defense of the people caused Gavriel to be invited back, as above, "va'Ani Basi bi'Devarecha".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>When he returned, he succeeded in diminishing somewhat the effect of the concessions made to Dubiel, but he was not successful in blunting the effect of Yavan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>RECHITZAH AS AN INUY (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Alternate explanation for how Rechitzah is considered an Inuy derives from Shlomoh ha'Melech's dialogue with Evyasar ha'Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Evyasar was spared being killed right away for having participated in the Inuy of David ha'Melech.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Included in that Inuy was "Ra'av" (lack of bread), "Tzamei" (lack of water) and "Ayef" (lit. tiredness, understood to refer to Rechitzah) thus labeling Rechitzah as an Inuy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Ayef" refers to (the lack of) wearing shoes?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk in Mishlei demonstrates that "Ayef" relates to the lack of cool water (presumably for washing).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Ayef" refers to their thirst (which would fit with the Pasuk in Mishlei, as well)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk reads "like water <i>on</i> a tired soul", not '<i>in'</i> as would imply drinking.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>NE'ILAS HA'SANDEL AS AN INUY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence that Ne'ilas ha'Sandel is called an Inuy?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the fact that David ha'Melech, when running from Avshalom (in the state referred to before as Inuy) was "Yachef" (presumably, without shoes).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Yachef" means without a horse, in the manner of a king?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The word "Yachef" is found, in Yeshayah, to mean unshod, thus informing its meaning by David ha'Melech.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Yeshayah went with tattered shoes, and that is still called "Yachef" (just as "Arom" there surely does not mean fully unclothed, but with tattered clothes)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk in Yirmiyah identifies "Yachef" with the exiles, who would truly be going barefoot.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TASHMISH HAMITAH AS AN INUY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence that Tashmish ha'Mitah is called an Inuy?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Lavan identified withholding Tashmish as an Inuy.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">77b----------------------------------------77b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Im Te'aneh" refers to withholding Tashmish.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"ve'Im Tikach" refers to taking other wives.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps both expressions refer to taking other wives (if you will oppress my daughters <i>by</i> taking other wives).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This translation is not plausible since Lavan said <i>"ve'Im" and </i> not "<i>Im"</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to two types of Tzaros, Bilhah and Zilpah, as well as other potential wives (which is contextually logical in the Pasuk)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He would not have put the less painful matter (taking other unknown wives) first and the more painful matter (taking Bilhah and Zilpah) second.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find (in the incident of Dinah) that Tashmish itself is called Inuy, thus casting doubt on its absence as being called Inuy!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Inuy there was withholding further Tashmish from Dinah, consistent with the definition of Inuy.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>RECHITZAH OF PART OF THE BODY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that partial Rechitzah is forbidden on Yom Kipur; however, if one is soiled, he may wash normally.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Similarly, while Sichah on even a part of the body is forbidden, one who is ill anoints normally.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A woman is permitted to wash one hand (from the Ru'ach Ra'ah upon awaking which would transfer onto bread) in order to give bread to a child.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Shamai ha'Zaken was concerned about using one hand (on account of the Shivsa), and they permitted him to feed the child after washing both hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>One who is going to greet his father or Rebbi, or another person greater than he, may enter water until his neck, without concern.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What of the Rebbi on route to his Talmid?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yitzhok b. Chanah reported that Zeiri went to R Chiya.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Ashi reported that it was R. Chiya b. Ashi who went to Zeiri his Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Rava permitted people to cross through water to protect their fruit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> A Beraisa supports this ruling, as reported.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Yosef permitted people to cross to attend a Shiur, but not to return to their homes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If you will rule this way, you will cause them not to come next year to the Shiur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An alternate reading has R. Yosef permitting both their coming and their return.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Abaye then asked why their return is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yosef explained that the permission is so they should not be prevented from coming in the future.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>R. Yehudah, R. Shmuel b. R. Yehudah were standing on one side of the river, and Rami b. Papa was on the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rami b. Papa called out to ask if he was permitted to cross in order to ask them about a matter of Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah responded that Rav and Shmuel permitted one to cross, but being careful not to raise one's hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>An alternate reading has R. Shmuel b. R. Yehudah reporting the same response directly from a Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE RIVER LEADING OUT OF THE KODESH HAKODOSHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosef):</span> Is it <i>ever</i> permitted to enter deep waters and expose oneself to danger?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mal'ach showed Yechezkel the river which will lead out of Yerushalayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It will be shallow for the first 1000 Amos, and will get deeper after each 1000 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We see there that it is permitted to enter shallow water only up to one's waist!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That river is different because of the strong current, thus above waist deep will be dangerous, as opposed to the still river we are speaking of.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Will one be able to swim across that river?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The continuation of the Pasuk indicates that it will be too strong for that, as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Might one be able to cross in a small boat?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk indicates that this, too, will not be possible.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Might one be be able to cross with a large vessel?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The river in Yechezkel's prophecy will be too powerful even for that.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The Targum confirms the impossibility of crossing this river.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Even the Mal'ach ha'Maves will not be able to cross, as indicated by the word "mi'Shut".</p></div>
