<p class="dedicationbox">YOMA 46 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE SEPARATE MA'ARACHAH FOR EIVARIM AND PEDARIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar citing b. Kapara reporting that R. Meir taught):</span> The leftover Eivarim of the Olos were brought on a specially lit Ma'arachah, even on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah already mentioned that Ma'arachah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would not have known that the Pesulin are also treated likewise.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is providing they had been somewhat burnt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Alternately, both Kosher and Pasul Eivarim are treated alike.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah already taught that the Ma'arachah was made on Yom Kipur (the fifth Ma'arachah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would not have known to do so on Yom Kipur which falls during the week.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What!? The Mishnah says every day?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Good question.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A SEPARATE MA'ARACHAH ON SHABBOS FOR FRIDAY'S KORBANOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The teaching of R. Elazar above argues with R. Huna who taught that the <i>end</i> of the Tamid is <i>not</i> Docheh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the end not Docheh, <i>Tum'ah</i> or Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chisda holds it is Docheh Shabbos but not <i>Tum'ah</i> while Rava holds the opposite.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whichever D'rashah teaches one should teach the other (a question on both Rava and R. Chisda)!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava for himself):</span> The concluding Avodah (Haktaras Eivarim) is learned from the starting Avodah (Shechitah and Zerikah which can be done be'<i>Tum'ah</i> but not on Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava for R. Chisda):</span> Shabbos is <i>Hutrah</i> (creating greater Heter) whereas <i>Tum'ah</i> is <i>Dechuyah</i> by Korbanos Tzibur (creating minimal Heter [only the starting Avodah]).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>EXTINGUISHING COALS REMOVED FROM THE MIZBE'ACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Abaye says one is Chayav for extinguishing, Rava says one is Patur (speaking when the coals have been taken down from the Mizbe'ach, not when they are still on the Mizbe'ach, where one is certainly Chayav).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Abaye still considers it Eish ha'Mizbe'ach while Rava sees it as separated from its source.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the Halachah of R. Nachman (citing Rabah b. Avuhah that one is Chayav for extinguishing a removed coal) then only according to Abaye?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even Rava could subscribe to R. Nachman since <i>those</i> coals were not removed for their Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Rendition:</span> Rava and Abaye agree that one is Patur for extinguishing a removed coal, they argue when one extinguishes the coal on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Abaye still considers it Eish... Rava sees it as separated.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Nachman is then not like Abaye or Rava?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Those coals were not removed for their Mitzvah.</p></div>
