<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A MAD DOG</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa lists five attributes of a mad dog.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did it become this way?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Witches fun.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> Evil spirits.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make how it became mad?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Whether to kill it only from a distance (Shmuel, lest the evil spirits attack the person) or even from close (Rav).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>A Beraisa supports Shmuel, indicating also that it is dangerous to rub against a mad dog (and lethal to be bitten by one).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The Gemara describes the procedure (removing one's coat, etc) for dealing with the dangers created by rubbing against such a dog (and R. Huna was able to save himself with this knowledge).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The Gemara describes the incantation and procedure needed to save one who was bitten by such a dog.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>During the 12 months of the procedure the victim should not drink from a cup in a manner which would allow the image of the offending spirit to endanger the victim who would see it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This precaution was taken in the case of Aba b. Marta.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>R. YOCHANAN AND THE CURE FOR TZAFIDNA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>When a gentile matron administered a cure for R. Yochanan's Tzafidna for two consecutive days - he asked her for instructions on how to prepare it himself, should the need arise on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>She made him swear by the G-d of Israel that he would not divulge the formula; he swore and then divulged the secret.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>He did not break his promise - because when she demanded that he swear by the G-d of Israel that he would not so, he inverted her words, and swore that he would not divulge her secret <i>to</i> the G-d of Israel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Neither did he create a Chilul Hash-m by causing her to <i>think</i> that he was breaking his promise - because he informed her immediately as to what he had done.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Some say that the secret cure was yeast-water, olive oil and salt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>There are two other opinions:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first, replaces yeast-water with ... yeast.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The second states only one ingredient - the oil from one of the feathers on a goose's wing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> None of the above methods work, however, an Arab told him to use date-stones that had not yet grown a third - which he was to burn in the fire produced by burning a new hoe, and to place the ashes on his teeth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does one contract Tzafidna?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tzafidna is caused by eating very hot bread and the remnants of fish fried in flour, in their own oil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does one know that he has contracted it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When his teeth bleed easily.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>R. YOCHANAN AND R. MASYA B. CHARASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yochanan permitted this cure (for Tzafidna) on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In accordance with whom is this Heter?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Masya b. Charash (who maintains in our Mishnah that any illness inside the mouth is considered life- threatening).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya b. Aba):</span> But the Chachamim disagree (in the case of the Chatzar Kaved)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The Chachamim argued only regarding that particular procedure, not regarding other medications.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>A Beraisa seems to support R. Yochanan's contention:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Masya b. Charash):</span> A person...</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>with jaundice is permitted to eat donkey's meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>bitten by a mad dog may eat part of its liver.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>whose mouth hurts may take medicine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> '<i>be'Eilu</i> Ein Bahem Mishum Refu'ah'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the Chachamim specifying (and excluding) with 'be'Eilu'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The jaundice and mad dog bite are <i>not a</i> Refu'ah and the throat medicine <i>is</i> (like R. Yochanan).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>No, the Chachamim are arguing with all three Refu'os, and only concede the efficacy of a fourth case, letting blood for someone who has Serunchi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This seems to be supported by the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Chachamim (referring to three lenient rulings of R. Masya b. Charash, the first of which is letting blood for Serunchi) comment 'be'<i>Eilu</i> Ein Bahem Mishum Refu'ah'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Presumably 'b<i>e'Eilu'</i> challenges the effectiveness of the last two stated cases, and excludes the first (allowing that it is effective).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>No, R. Yochanan may be defended, as 'be<i>'Eilu</i>' can refer to the <i>first two</i> cases, and the Chachamim are allowing for the effectiveness of the last case (medicine for oral pain).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">84b----------------------------------------84b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Yochanan may be supported from a third Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar b. R. Yosi citing R. Masya b. Charash):</span> It is permitted to feed:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>a pregnant woman until she recovers;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Chatzar Kaved for a mad dog bite; and,</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>medicine on Shabbos for oral pain.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> 'be'Zu ve'Lo ba'Acheres'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which case do the Chachamim refer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To the pregnant woman.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Their agreement to this case is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They must refer to, and agree with, the medicine for oral pain (they cannot refer to the Chatzar Kaved since the Chachamim explicitly argue in the Mishnah on this case).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>This, indeed, supports R. Yochanan, and R. Ashi infers this from the (manner in which the cases are listed that the Chachamim are arguing in the) Mishnah itself.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SAFEK NEFASHOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah tell us, again (after teaching that someone with mouth pains is a case of Safek Nefashos), that all Safek Nefashos is Docheh Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah citing Rav):</span> To permit breaking the Shabbos even if he might die on a different Shabbos (but would certainly survive this one).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What would be an example?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The doctors assessed that the patient needed to take cures for eight days and we might otherwise have thought that we may as well wait for night-fall and begin taking the medicine only <i>after</i> Shabbos, in order to avoid unnecessary Chilul Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This is borne out by a Beraisa, which permits breaking <i>this</i> Shabbos for a Safek Piku'ach Nefesh <i>next</i> Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Where it is necessary to save a Jew's life, we do not rely on a gentile or a child to do so (in the most effective manner) but rather an adult Jew should do the Chilul Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>We are not Mechalel Shabbos based only on the assessment of women or gentiles, however, they combine with another person to permit the patient to eat (even against two others saying that he need not).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>PIKUACH NEFESH ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches in four cases that one who is quick to be Mechalel Shabbos and save a life is praiseworthy, and then teaches that he need not obtain permission from Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Gemara explains by each case why one who is praiseworthy might think to nevertheless seek permission.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>By a child who fell into the sea (even though the person who saves will also catch fish for himself).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>By a child who fell into a deep pit (even though he fashions a ladder for himself).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>By a child on whom the door closed and locked (even though he seeks to use the splinters from the door).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>By someone who was trapped by an oncoming fire (even though he intends to preserve the coals thereby).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We need to be taught each of the four cases, owing to the peculiarities of each case.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The child who fell in the sea would be swept away if time were allowed for questions, unlike the child in the pit.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The child in the pit may go into shock whereas we might be able to play games with the child on the other side of the door until after Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>And we repeat the Heter regarding an oncoming fire even if the child is in another court-yard.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>ROV IN PIKUACH NEFESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef citing R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> In matters of life and death, we do not follow the majority.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Under what circumstances are we taught this Din?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer 1:</span> In the case of a wall which fell onto a group of nine Jews and one gentile, burying one beneath it, and we do not know which one.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there it is <i>obvious</i> that we will follow the majority in order to save a life!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer 2:</span> It speaks of the case where the group consists of five Jews and five gentiles.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that is a regular case of Safek Nefashos Lehakel!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer 3:</span> It speaks where there are nine gentiles and one Jew.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the principle of 'Kol Kavu'a' makes that case obvious, as well (it is no different than 50-50)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer 4:</span> It speaks of the case in Answer 3, however, where the wall fell on him after they had moved to another court-yard.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We should apply the principle 'Kol de'Parish, me'Rubah Parish' (making it forbidden to save him on Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Shmuel has thus taught that we do not follow the Rov in matters of Piku'ach Nefesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yochanan has taught that in just such a case of nine Gentiles and one Jew, we only save the one person in <i>that</i> Chatzer, not in another Chatzer!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel speaks where they <i>all</i> moved to the other Chatzer, thus we have established that a Jew is among the group in the new Chatzer, while R. Yochanan forbids where only <i>some</i> of the group moved to the new Chatzer.</p></div>
