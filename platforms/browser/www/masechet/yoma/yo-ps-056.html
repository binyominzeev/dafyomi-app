<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>BEREIRAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence do you derive R. Yehudah's position that he does not rely on Bereirah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the Beraisa wherein R. Yehudah prohibits taking Terumos and Ma'aseros from wine (and being allowed to designate and be Mechalel it) before Shabbos, and on Shabbos leaving it over in the bottle.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps his rationale to prohibit there is as taught, out of concern that the bottle might break (a concern which R. Meir does not share)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From R. Yehudah's position prohibiting making a condition this way and that on two Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is one Chacham different than two?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is speaking where the Chacham has already arrived, and only the student is unaware of his direction.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>According to R. Yochanan, that, too, is unrelated to Bereirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But if R. Yehudah does not rely on Bereirah, and he <i>does</i> rely on Kesivah, then make two shelves and mark them!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kohen Gadol, in his weakened state, may not pay attention to the writing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If weakness were not the reason, and we <i>could</i> rely on the alertness of the Kohen Gadol;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Then the greater quantity of Dam Par would be enough of a differentiation between the Damim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>And if we assume that he only received an equal amount of Dam from the Par as from the Sa'ir;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>We were taught by R. Yehudah that <i>all</i> the Dam must be collected.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>And if quantity is not reliable (owing to spillage) then their color would differentiate them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It must be the weakness of the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CONSISTENT HALACHIC POSITIONS IN THE MUSAF PRAYERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rava pointed out to the Sh'liach Tzibur that his prayer was inconsistent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>His prayer spoke of <i>two</i> shelves, like the Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He mentioned picking up the Dam Par before setting down the Dam Sa'ir, like R. Yehudah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rava told him to rather say put down the Dam Sa'ir first and make it consistent with the Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SECOND HAZA'AH IN THE HEICHAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>From "ve'Chein Ya'aseh" we learn that the Haza'ah in the Heichal is identical to that in the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This includes the number of Haza'os as well as the manner in which they were sprinkled.</p></div>
