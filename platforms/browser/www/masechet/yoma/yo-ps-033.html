<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ABAYE REPORTS THE ORDER OF THE DAILY AVODAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Abaye transmits the tradition according to Aba Shaul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He reports 14 steps of the Avodah, starting with the Ma'arachah Gedolah and concluding with the evening Tamid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Each step in his order is justified in the subsequent Gemara.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>JUSTIFYING THE ORDER OF THE AVODAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>That the Ma'arachah Gedolah comes first is inferred from a Beraisa which draws from the Pasuk that there are two Ma'arachos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Ma'arachah Sheiniyah should come first?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We should give first priority to that which has more Kaparah (the Ma'arachah Gedolah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should give priority to the Ma'arachah from which we take coals within for the Ketores?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Still, more Kaparah takes precedence.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> In the absence of coals from the second Ma'arachah, we would bring in coals from the first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>That the Ma'arachah Sheiniyah precedes the Sidur two Gezirei Eitzim is derived from "Alehah" which singles out one Ma'arachah, thus inferring the existence of two Ma'arachos already.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But "Alehah" is needed for its own Halachah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Alehah" appears twice in the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>That the two Gezirei Eitzim precede the Dishun Mizbe'ach Penimi is derived in spite of the presence of "ba'Boker ba'Boker" by both the Dishun and the two Gezirei Eitzim as we give precedence to a Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How are the Gezirei Eitzim a Machshir for the Ketores, given that the coals for the Ketores were taken from the Ma'arachah Sheiniyah, not the Ma'arachah Gedolah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Eitzim have the status of Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Once involved with the Ma'arachah, we complete it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> In the absence of coals from the second Ma'arachah, we would bring in coals from the first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>That the Dishun precedes the Hatavah of the five Neiros is part of Abaye's tradition, for which he did not know a reason.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rava taught the reason for the precedence is in order not to pass over Mitzvos (based on Resh Lakish) since he encounters the Mizbe'ach ha'Zahav first upon entry into the Heichal.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches the positions of each of the Keilim in the Heichal.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let the Mizbe'ach be in line between the Shulchan and the Menorah (and not slightly off- line to the East)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk teaches that there must be a direct line of sight between the Menorah and the Shulchan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rava learned from Resh Lakish an application to Tefilin, requiring a person to place the Shel Yad first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>That the Hatavas Chamesh Neiros precedes the Tamid, and;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>That the Tamid precedes the Hatavas Sh'tei Neiros is derived from the (otherwise superfluous) words "ba'boker ba'Boker" which appear by the Hatavas Chamesh Neiros.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There are three "Boker" references by the Hatavas Chamesh Neiros, whereas the Tamid has two (giving the Hatavah precedence).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Even though both the Tamid and the Hatavas Sh'tei Neiros each have two "Boker" references, we give precedence to the Tamid since it is Mechaper.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps one "Boker" should be sent to Dishun Mizbe'ach ha'Penimi and it will then precede the Tamid and a second "Boker" should be sent to the Tamid, placing it before the five Neiros (precedence given to the Mechaper)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This (which will result in the five Neiros being prepared right before the two Neiros with no intervening Avodah) can work according to Resh Lakish.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>However, it will not work according to R. Yochanan (given his D'rashah to separate the Hatavos)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The "ba'Boker is not superfluous (to place the Gezirei Eitzim before the second Ma'arachah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Alehah" has already taught us that both Ma'arachos precede the Ketores!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do the five Neiros before the two?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once we begin, we do the majority.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then let us do six?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The second Hatavah is spoken of in the plural.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>That the two Neiros precede the Ketores is seen in the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>That the Ketores precedes the Eivarim is based on the presence of two words "Boker" over the presence of one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>That the Eivarim precede the Minchah is derived from the prefix <i>"ha'</i>Olah", meaning that the Olas ha'Tamid is offered first.</p></div>
