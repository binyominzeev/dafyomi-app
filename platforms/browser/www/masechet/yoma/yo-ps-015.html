<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ABA SHAUL AND RABANAN ON NEIROS AND KETORES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a contradiction between the two orders here in Yoma?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> One is speaking after the Hatavah of the five candles; one after the two.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Abaye hold that the interruption is filled with the Ketores, but we know that he holds that it is the Dam Tamid!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> This is resolved by the existence of a Machlokes Rabanan (Ketores then Neiros) and Aba Shaul (Neiros then Ketores interrupting the Neiros with Zerikas ha'Tamid).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The rationale of Aba Shaul is "be'Haitivo" then "Yaktirenah".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The Rabanan take that to mean that the Ketores should have already been offered at the time of Hatavas ha'Neiros.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Otherwise we would end up with the Ketores being brought after the Neiros in the afternoon!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe that is so?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> But the Neiros is the end, continuing all night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>Thus, both he Hatavah and the Hadlakah are done with the Ketores already having been done.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will Aba Shaul do with this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That restricts only the night (Oso).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> One listing (our Mishnah) is Rabanan (Ketores first) and one (the Payis listing) is Aba Shaul (Neiros first).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Seifa of the Payis listing appears to follow Rabanan (Ketores in the middle).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The opening and closing are Rabanan, while the middle is Aba Shaul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Abaye did not agree with R. Papa in order to avoid this change of authorship in mid-Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Papa did agree with Abaye to avoid the switch from speaking of the five candles to the two.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Abaye responds that the first Mishnah is listing the Avodos with which the Kohen needs to be familiar, not the actual order of the Avodah (listed later).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ZERIKAS DAM HATAMID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We were taught that the Kohen sprinkled the Tamid on the <b>NE</b> corner and then on the <b>SW</b> corner (two corners as one).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon Ish ha'Mitzpeh taught that after the <b>NE</b> sprinkling (as two) the <b>SW</b> sprinkling was split (West then South, separately).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yochanan (citing a member of R. Yanai's Yeshiva) taught that R. Shimon learned from the Pasuk where the Torah gives this Olah (the Tamid) some of the laws of a Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then do the two (as four) sprinklings as an Olah and then the four (separate) as a Chatas?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not find blood at a second Kaparah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But neither do we find blood half-Olah half- Chatas (the Torah is forcing our hand here)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is only Pisuk (it is not truly the sprinkling of a Chatas).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not sprinkle the one-as-two below (Olah) and the two-as-two above (Chatas)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not find such a split above/below.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find such by Yom ha'Kipurim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is Matzlif (like lashes) and not actual above/below the midline.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Again, we find such a split on the Taharo Shel Mizbe'ach (implying above/below the midline)?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it speaks of a clear area on the Mizbe'ach itself, not above/below.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why the Olah sprinkling first?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is, after all, an Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why at the <b>NE</b> and <b>SW</b> corners?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The sprinkling of an Olah requires Yesod.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why <b>NE</b> first, not <b>SW</b> first?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we must turn East, we get to <b>NE</b> first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe a Chatas should have characteristics of an Olah, not the reverse?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk implies that a quality of Chatas is done to the Olah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHERE WAS THE LISHKAS HATELAIM?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In one Mishnah we are taught that this Lishkah was in the <b>NW</b>, and in another we are taught that it was <b>SW</b>!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah in Midos is R. Elazar b. Ya'akov.</p></div>
