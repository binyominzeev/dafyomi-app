<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Zar who consumes Terumah abnormally, pays the principle but not the Chomesh (he has damaged the grain, not eaten it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Once food has been eaten (and the Zar has become liable in Keren and Chomesh), subsequent consumption of that food renders the user liable only to pay the firewood value to the first (and nothing to the Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>FOOD AND DRINK DO NOT COMBINE ON YOM KIPUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the author of this non-Tziruf rule?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer: (R. Chisda):</span> It is R. Yehoshua who taught that Tziruf (for Tum'ah) only occurs when two items have the identical time-frame and Shi'ur (whereas according to the Chachamim there is Tziruf even if there is an overlap in time-frame and Shiur).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer: (R. Nachman):</span> Our Mishnah could even follow the opinion of the Chachamim, and their view of Tziruf by Tum'ah (where both items are called Tamei) may not apply on Yom Kipur (where, even combined, the less-than-Shi'ur amount of food and/or drink does not generate Yishuv ha'Da'as).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Resh Lakish taught like R. Chisda and R. Yochanan taught like R. Nachman.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: COMBINING CHIYUVIM OF YOM KIPUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If one ate and drank (the Shiur of each) in one He'elam, he brings only one Chatas (they are both parts of one Isur).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one ate and did Melachah in one He'elam, he is Chayav two Chataos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one ate non-edibles he is Patur.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>A LAAV IN THE TORAH FOR THE MITZVAH OF INUY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> There is no Lav in the Torah regarding <i>Inuy</i> because language is lacking to express such a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>'Lo Yochal' would imply Achilah (bi'ke'Zayis).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>'Lo Se'uneh' would imply that one <i>must</i> eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The language could be 'Hishamer Pen Lo Se'uneh'!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That would create <i>two</i> Lavin ('Hishamer' and 'Pen').</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The wording could be 'Hishamer be'Mitzvas <i>Inuy'</i>!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That would create an Asei, not a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let it say 'Al Tasur Min ha'<i>Inuy'</i>!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Good question.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>DERIVING THE AZHARAH FROM THE BERAISA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa derives the Azharah from "ve'Inisem... "</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Pasuk "ve'Chol ha'Nefesh" comes to restrict the Kareis to the day itself, and not to any additions to the day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Pasuk "ve'Chol Melachah ... " comes to restrict the Torah prohibition to the day itself, and not to Tosefes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Logic dictates that there would not be a Lav on added <i>Inuy</i> (if Tosefes Melachah is not a Lav...).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The source of the Azharah regarding <i>Inuy</i> is the Torah's superfluous reference to Kareis by Melachah (which could have been derived logically from Melachah of Shabbos/Yom Tov) which serves to link Melachah (where the Azharah is explicit) to <i>Inuy</i> (where the Azharah is thus derived).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the difference between Melachah and <i>Inuy</i> should disrupt this connection (<i>Inuy</i> has no exceptions while Melachah is excepted in the Avodah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the derivation is from the superfluous reference to Kareis by <i>Inuy</i>, which creates the link to Melachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Melachah is more frequent than <i>Inuy</i>!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> The Tana of the Beraisa in fact learns the Azharah from the link between Melachah and <i>Inuy</i> created by "<i>"Etzem"</i>".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This link is Mufneh, as analyzed below, and is hence not subject to the disruptions above.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>There are five Pesukim, one is Mufneh for the link.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Another source for the Azharah by Yom Kipur is provided by Tana de'Bei R. Yishmael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><i>Inuy</i> is written by Yom Kipur and by Oneis (of Eishes Ish).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Just as by Oneis there is no Onesh without an Azharah, so, too, by Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Another source is provided by R. Acha b. Ya'akov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The term "Shabbos Shabason" links Yom Kipur to Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Just as there is no Onesh by Shabbos without an Azharah, so, too, by Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">81b----------------------------------------81b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> Since Yom Kipur itself is called 'Shabbos' ("Tishbesu Shabatchem"), it is like Shabbos in both Onesh and Azharah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He prefers learning from the Pasuk itself than from a Gezeirah Shavah as did R. Acha b. Ya'akov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Acha b. Ya'akov not do the same?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He uses "Tishbesu Shabatchem" to learn Tosefes Shabbos and Yom Tov from Yom Kipur (as in the Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will the Tana who uses "<i>"Etzem"</i>" to restrict Kareis to the day itself and not to Tosefes (he must already know Tosefes as a Lav) do with "be'Sish'ah la'Chodesh" (which this Beraisa uses as the source for Tosefes)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach that if one eats on the ninth, he is considered to have fasted on both the ninth and tenth.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>NON-NORMAL EATING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who eats spices as though they were food (pepper or ginger) on Yom Kipur is Patur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we have learned that not only the pepper, but even the bush of the pepper is considered an edible food!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to moist pepper (edible), while Rava is speaking about dried pepper (edible only as a condiment).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Nachman taught that ginger <i>is</i> edible!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Again, that speaks where the ginger is moist.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>LEAVES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One is Patur for consuming the leaves of trees and vines, but Chayav for the leaves of a grapevine (Lulvei Gefanim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzhok Magdela'ah):</span> This refers to young, soft leaves while leaves older than Rosh ha'Shanah would be Patur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Kehanah):</span> The cutoff is 30 days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A Beraisa supports R. Yitzhok Magdela'ah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>DRINKING BRINE IS PATUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>By inference, vinegar would be Chayav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of our Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Rebbi who taught that vinegar satisfies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Gidel b. Menashe taught that the Halachah is not like Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The following year people diluted vinegar and drank it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Gidel objected, stating that the discussion only revolved around being Patur or Chayav, not Mutar!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Further, we only spoke of a small quantity of vinegar, but surely a large quantity is satisfying!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Further, we only spoke of undiluted vinegar, never of diluted vinegar (which certainly may satisfy)!</p></div>
