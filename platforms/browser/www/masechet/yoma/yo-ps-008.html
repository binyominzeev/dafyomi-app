<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's source for the correct placement of the Tzitz?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Al Mitzcho</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That should suffice for R. Shimon, as well?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed it does.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What, then, will R. Shimon do with Al Metzach... ve'Nasa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach that the Tzitz needs to be <i>able</i> to be on the Metzach of the Kohen (i.e. not broken).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will R. Yehudah learn this Din?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Metzach-Metzcho</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will R. Shimon do with the extra Vav?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not significant for interpretation.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MORE ON TUM'AS HAMES HUTRAH OR DECHUYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>This appears to be a Machlokes Tanaim in the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> Both Kohanim (Yom Kippur and Parah) get Haza'ah on all seven days of their Perishah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> It is only on the third and seventh days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> The Kohen of the Parah gets every day while the Kohen of Yom Kippur gets on the third and seventh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The dispute seems to center on Dechuyah (R. Meir) and Hutrah (R. Yosi)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But then R. Yosi should not require <i>any</i> sprinkling!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both Tanaim hold Dechuyah, and they are arguing over whether Tevilah bi'Zemanahis (R.Meir) or is not (R. Yosi) a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But our understanding of the Beraisa is that R. Yosi holds that it <i>is</i> a Mitzvah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both Tanaim in that Beraisa hold Mitzvah, and they are arguing over whether (R. Meir) or not (R. Yosi) we link Haza'ah to Tevilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Chanina make the link or not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does not (and the Kohen Parah gets Haza'ah as a Ma'alah b'Almah).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Whom does the Beraisa below follow?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Perishas Kohen of Yom Kippur is for Kedushah and that of Parah is for Taharah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is the sole difference between them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A practical difference is whether others may touch him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>It may either be R. Meir or R. Yosi, but not R. Chanina (according to whom there are several differences).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is no reason for Haza'ah on the fourth day!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir does not mean <i>every</i> day, since Shabbos is anyway not possible.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>An application of this would be that we would take the Kohen Parah so that his fourth day is Shabbos (and there is only one lost day of Haza'ah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>LISHKAS PARHADRIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it was called Lishkas Balvati (officers), not Parhadrin (market overseer for the King).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the good days it was called Balvati; when the office became corrupted it was known as Parhadrin.</p></div>
