<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE LISHAKOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>In Beis Avtinas he learned Chafinah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> He had two Lishkos, one Parhedrin and one was Beis Avtinas, one in the North and one in the South.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Mishnah lists the six Lishkos in the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Lishkas ha'Melach - South</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Lishkas ha'Parvah- South, above which was the Mikveh of the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Lishkas ha'Madichin- South, and steps leading to the roof of the Beis ha'Parvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Lishkas ha'Etz- North (R. Elazar b. Ya'akov forgot its purpose) Abba Sha'ul reported that it was for the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Lishkas ha'Golah- North, the water supply.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Lishkas ha'Gazis- North, for the Sanhedrin who judged the fitness of the Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Those who were found Pasul...</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Those who were found Kasher...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>In addition to the one in the North, the Kohen Gadol had a Lishkah in the South (one of the Lishkos reported alongside the southern of the seven Gates).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Papa was unclear as to which of his Lishkos (Parhedrin or Beis Avtinas) was in the North and South.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>It seemed likely that Parhedrin was in the North to minimize his walking back and forth during his day's activities.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But troubling him is a good thing if it:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Discouraged Tzedukim from staying on the job.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Prevented a swelled head (since we could cause him even less walking if we so desired, by relocating or even concentrating his Lishkos).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>AGENCY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah may be a refutation of R. Huna b. R. Yehoshuah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He taught that a Kohen is considered an agent of Heaven, not of the one bringing the offering.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is supported by the general rule of agency that the agent may not do anything which the one who appointed him may not do himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Yet the Mishnah calls the Kohen Gadol the agent of the officers?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The oath is taken under the assumptions of the Beis Din, not that he is their actual agent.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AN OATH AMIDST TEARS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>He cried on account of their suspicion that he was a Tzedoki.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>They cried because one who groundlessly suspects another will be personally afflicted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was all the suspicion about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding the departure from tradition of the Tzedokim, as demonstrated in the reported incident.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Tzedoki performed the Avodah in their incorrect manner.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>His father warned him not to openly disobey the Perushim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He was pleased with his compliance with their misunderstanding.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>He did not live long, as reported.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SPEAKING OR SIGNALING DURING SHEMA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav signaled that the name was Kavutal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say the name?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was in the middle of Keri'as Shema.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then how was he permitted to signal (two Beraisos which demonstrate the prohibition of doing so)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These speak during the first paragraph, whereas Rav was in the second.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>VEDIBARTA BAM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Pasuk teaches that one must hear himself for Keri'as Shema but not for Tefilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Further, one is exclusively permitted to speak words of Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Also, make these words permanent, not passing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>One who speaks non-Torah matters violates an Asei...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>He also violates a Lav...</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MISHNAH: KEEPING THE KOHEN GADOL UP AT NIGHT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The young Kohanim would snap their fingers to rouse him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he was very drowsy they would get him to stand up.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>They would occupy him until the time for Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>SNAPPING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which is the Etzba Tzerada?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tzarah to the other (the thumb).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Huna demonstrated the snap and it made quite a noise.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>GETTING THE KOHEN GADOL TO STAND UP</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>They would ask him to show them something new.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This was the bowing (which was to the ground without touching it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>They would not use instruments to occupy the Kohen Gadol; rather they would sing to him ("Im Hash-m Lo Yivneh... ").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The precious Jews of Yerushalayim would also stay up so that the sounds of their Torah would rouse the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Aba Shaul reported that this was done even after the Churban in various places, but it sometimes led to sin (as reported in the conversation between Eliyahu and R. Yehudah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What does Hash-m say...?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>What does the Satan say...?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>We learn from the reported incident that the Satan has no power to accuse on Yom Kipur (his number is only 364).</p></div>
