<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: ERRORS IN THE ORDER OF THE AVODAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>An Avodah done out of sequence is meaningless.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he did the Haza'ah of the Dam Sa'ir before the Dam Par, he must do the Haza'ahs Dam Sa'ir again.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If the rest of the Dam (Shirayim) was poured out before he completed the Matanos, he must slaughter a new Par and start that Avodah again;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The same will hold if it was poured out during the Haza'os in the Heichal, whether on the Paroches or on the Mizbe'ach ha'Zahav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Each one is a separate Avodah which, once completed, need not be repeated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Elazar and R. Shimon maintain that he need not even go back to the beginning of that Avodah, rather, he resumes where he left off.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE ORDER OF WHICH AVODOS ARE MEAKEV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Only the order of the Avodos in the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim (done in Bigdei Lavan) is Me'akev (not those done in Bigdei Lavan outside of the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nechemyah):</span> The order of all Avodos done in Bigdei Lavan is Me'akev (inside or out).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Both of these opinions derive from the application of the word "Chukah" in the Pasuk:</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah would say that "Chukah" refers to the <i>place</i> where the once a year Kaparah occurs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Nechemyah understands that "Chukah" refers to all those Avodos which bring atonement once a year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But <i>place</i> does not appear in the Pasuk!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, R. Yehudah derives from the limiter words "Zos" and "Achas" that "Chukah" is not speaking about Bigdei Lavan outside, nor about Bigdei Zahav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will R. Nechemyah learn from these limiters?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One excludes Bigdei Zahav and the other excludes Shirayim (which were poured later than its proper turn).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence will R. Yehudah know the Din that the order is not Me'akev the Shirayim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shirayim follows the other Avodos done in Bigdei Lavan (and will be Me'akev, as they are).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>R. Yehudah's Din is found as one opinion in the Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Akiva learns the Pasuk "Kiper-Kilah" (as explained below).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehudah learns (with the order of the Pasuk) "Kilah-Kiper".</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Their meaning is the subject of a Machlokes R. Yochanan and R. Yehoshua b. Levi.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>One view holds that all agree that Shirayim are not Me'akev and the argument revolves around how to decode the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p>According to the other view, the argument is over the issue of Shirayim being Me'akev (hence the position of R. Yehudah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find R. Yochanan teaching that R. Nechemyah (who interprets "Chukah", as does R. Yehudah) is of the view that Shirayim <i>are</i> Me'akev (yet here [in 2.c.] he says that, according to R. Nechemyah, Shirayim are not Me'akev!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Good question.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SHECHITAH OUT OF ORDER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Chafinah of the Ketores done before the Shechitah of the Par is meaningless.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This seems to depart from the view of R. Yehudah who holds that "Chukah" only applies to Avodos which are done in Bigdei Lavan within (and Shechitah is not done there)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even according to R. Yehudah, Shechitah is <i>needed</i> for the Avodas P'nim and is considered as such.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the Mishnah (in 1.c. above) should require a new <i>Chafinah</i> in a case where we needed to slaughter a new Par for the Hazaos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana was only dealing with the Hazaos (and not with the Ketores at all, whose Chafinah would, indeed, need to be repeated -Rashi).</p></div>
