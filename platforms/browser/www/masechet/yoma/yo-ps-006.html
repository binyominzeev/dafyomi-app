<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>AHARON AND HIS SONS DONNING THE BIGDEI KEHUNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can he maintain that Moshe dressed Aharon and his sons together, given that the Pesukim clearly refer to two donnings, one singular and one plural?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are different not in the donning, but in their composition (linen with wool vs. linen alone).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can he maintain that they were donned in succession given the Pasuk written in the plural?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Pasuk teaches that their composition is the same.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then why do we have the singular and then plural donnings in the Pasuk?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be that they were donned in succession.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can he maintain that Moshe dressed Aharon and his sons Begadim together, a feat that seems impossible!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There was sequence (but no interruption).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SEGREGATING THE KOHEN GADOL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he segregated?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What do you mean! It has been completely dealt with!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>According to R. Yochanan- it is learned from Milu'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Resh Lakish learns it from Sinai.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We meant why can't he remain at home?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Lest he cohabit with his wife in a state of doubtful <i>Tum'ah</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are we dealing with evildoers!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We mean that he might cohabit and then discover doubtful <i>Tum'ah</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This follows the opinion of R. Akiva that a Nidah generates retroactive <i>Tum'ah</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that one who cohabits with a Nidah is not as stringent as the Nidah herself (since she can immerse only on the night <i>after</i> her seventh day, whereas he immerses <i>on</i> the seventh day, [otherwise the Kohen would need eight days, not seven].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, they may be the same, and we separate the Kohen just prior to the onset of the first day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that there <i>is</i> this difference?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means to include in Nidah all related <i>Tum'ah</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa equates the Bo'el Nidah with a Tamei Mes (apparently to allow immersion during the day)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, they are equated regarding the duration of their <i>Tum'ah</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the duration of both is explicit in the Pasuk (It must be as we assumed, immersion by day)!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the comparison of the Beraisa is for the Seifa (to differentiate regarding <i>Tum'as</i> Mishkav and Moshav).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa explicitly teaches the difference of day and night between the Bo'el Nidah and the Nidah herself!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is, indeed, a Tiyuvta on R. Shimi.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TUM'AS HAMES HUTRAH OR DECHUYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should segregate him from all people (lest he become Tamei Mes)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The fact that we do not seems to imply <i>Tum'as</i> Mes is Hutrah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> It could still be Dechuyah, and we do not concern ourselves with such an unlikely scenario.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The matter is a Machlokes, which can be understood two ways.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Nachman- Hutrah; R. Sheishes- Dechuyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>First Lashon:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When a Tahor Kohen from that Beis Av is available, all agree that he (not the Tamei) does the Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Machlokes is whether, if all the Kohanim of that Beis Av are Tamei, to get a Tahor Kohen from a different Beis Av (Dechuyah), or not (Hutrah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Second Lashon:</span> The Machlokes is even when a Tahor Kohen from that Beis Av is available whether (Hutrah) or not (Dechuyah) the Kohen Tamei may serve.</p></div>
