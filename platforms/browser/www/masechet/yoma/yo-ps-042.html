<p class="dedicationbox">YOMA 42 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE WEIGHTS OF THREE THREADS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Dimi (citing R. Yochanan) was uncertain which weight (10 Zuz, two Sela'im and one Shekel) applies to which thread (that of the Parah, the Sa'ir and the Metzora).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Ravin (citing R. Yonasan) attributed the 10 Zuz to the Parah, two Selah to the Sa'ir and one Shekel to the Metzora.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> There is a dispute between R. Shimon b. Chalafta and the Rabanan regarding the Parah (is it 10 Zuz or one Shekel) and the mnemonic is One who is Marbeh...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> No, the dispute is over the Sa'ir and the memory aid comes from the passing of Ravya b. Kisi...</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHECHITAH B'ZAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzhok):</span> I was taught two Shechitos, one Kosher be'Zar, and one not ("Parah" and "Paro"), and I do not know which is which.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We are taught that the P'sul of Shechitas Zar is a Machlokes Rav and Shmuel (does it apply to "Parah" or to "Paro").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rav's response to R. Zeira ("Elazar" plus "Chukah") leads us to conclude that Rav holds that "<i>Parah</i> "is Pesulah be'Zar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But by "Paro" we <i>also</i> find "Elazar" and "Chukah"!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shechitah is not an Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then "Parah" should also allow for a Zar!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is different since it is Kodeshei Bedek ha'Bayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then <i>certainly</i> "Paro" should be Pasul be'Zar!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The model is Maros Negaim (not Avodah yet requires a Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Shmuel, then, holds that "Paro" is Pesulah be'Zar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But by "Parah" we <i>also</i> find "Aharon" and "Chukah"!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk ("ve'Shachat Oso Lefanav") teaches that Elazar may watch the Shechitah of a Zar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will Rav then do with the Pasuk of "ve'Shachat Oso Lefanav"?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To forbid Hesech ha'Da'as.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence will Shmuel learn that Halachah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From "ve'Saraf... "</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will Rav do with that Pasuk?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One Pasuk for Shechitah and one for Sereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We need both, since Shechitah is the start of the Avodah, and possibly the only part where a Kohen is required; and,</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Sereifah is what makes the Parah effective.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is excluded (that Hesech ha'Da'as would <i>not</i> invalidate)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Collecting the ashes and pouring the water over them are not good candidates;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The Pasuk insists on their Shemirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Throwing in the additional ingredients (not part of the actual Parah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p>We were taught that there is a Machlokes regarding the P'sul of a Zar by Parah between R. Ami (Kesheirah), R. Yitzhok Nafcha (Pesulah) and Ula (two versions regarding his position).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yehoshua b. Aba asked from a Beraisa (regarding parts of the Avodah which are invalid if performed by a woman) in support of Rav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the challenge to Shmuel from this Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the assumption is that anything which is Pasul if done by a woman would be Pasul if done by a Zar,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We see from sprinkling the water that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer(Abaye):</span> A woman is excluded because of "Elazar", and <i>that</i> should also exclude a Zar from Parah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE PESUKIM BY PARAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> When analyzed, some of the Pesukim correct a mis-impression of the previous or following Pasuk; while other Pesukim retain the impressions of the surrounding Pesukim:</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>"Unesatem...Elazar", implies Elazar and not le'Doros.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Some say this implies that future generations will require a Kohen Gadol (not a S'gan, as was Elazar).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Others say that future generations will allow for a Kohen Hedyot.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> On what basis would we insist on a Kohen Gadol in the future?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Chukah", "Chukah" from Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>"ve'Hotzei Osah... " not to bring another out with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is taught in a Mishnah that neither a black or another red Heifer may be used to coax the Parah out.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Each has its reason to prevent people from erring.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yosi says that the reason is simply the command of the Pasuk ("Osah").</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will the Tana Kama understand "Osah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This Tana is R. Shimon, who learns the rationale of the Pesukim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When will their approaches result in a difference in Halachah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In a case where a donkey is brought out with the Parah.</p></div>
