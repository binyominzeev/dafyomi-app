<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>R. SHEISHES RENDERS ZEVACH AS EILO SHEL AHARON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Sheishes could have rendered Zevach as the Korban Pesach, since it fits the criteria as well as does Eilo Shel Aharon?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds, like R. Yehudah, that one may not slaughter a Korban Pesach for one person alone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Pesach Sheini fits the criteria!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Not so, since Pesach Sheini is not Docheh <i>Tum'ah</i>.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PESACH AND CHAGIGAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Pesach grouped among the Korbanos Yachid (on 50a) while Chagigah is grouped among the Korbanos Tzibur (ibid) since the Tzibur gathers for both?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tzibur is not gathered for Pesach Sheini.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would Pesach Sheini otherwise fit the grouping such that it is Docheh <i>Tum'ah</i> and Shabbos?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this Tana holds that Pesach Sheini is Docheh <i>Tum'ah</i>, as the cited opinion of R. Yehudah indicates.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale for the Tana Kama (that Pesach Sheini is <i>not</i> Docheh <i>Tum'ah</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is logical that since he is only bringing the Pesach Sheini on account of his earlier <i>Tum'ah</i> that it is not Docheh <i>Tum'ah</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will R. Yehudah respond?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk, "ke'Chol Chukas ha'Pesach" allows it to be brought be'<i>Tum'ah</i> (if it did not work out to bring it be'Taharah, the Torah allows it to be brought 'be'<i>Tum'ah</i>).</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TO WHOM BELONGS THE PAR YOM HAKIPURIM?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The words "Asher Lo" should clearly indicate that the Korban is his own (the three-fold repetition of "Asher Lo" indicates that he must bring it from his own funds regardless of who is atoned by it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>But following that reasoning how are the Kohanim atoned without any ownership at all?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rather, the Torah allows the Kohanim access to Aharon's Par, and, by extension, the Par Yom ha'Kipurim could belong to all of them (be'Keviyusa, not only be'Kufia).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE PAROCHES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Kohen Gadol proceeded (from the 4th row in the Azarah) through the Heichal and walked along the Amah between the two curtains until he entered the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> There was only one curtain (based on the singular language of the Pasuk).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE PAROCHES (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the response of the Rabanan to R. Yosi?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Pasuk spoke of the Mishkan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The second Beis ha'Mikdash needed two curtains owing to the doubt regarding the exact demarcation between the Heichal and the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This area was once covered by the Amah Teraksin.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>WALKING TOWARDS THE KODSHEI HAKODOSHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches three opinions regarding the route of the Kohen Gadol through the Heichal:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah- at the Southern side of the Heichal between the Mizbe'ach and the Menorah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir- at the Northern side between the Shulchan and the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Others- between the Shulchan and the Northern wall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Others?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi (who holds that there is only one Paroches) and he walked along the North to the entrance there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that the entrance was in the South.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Meir's position does not seem to accept the entrance at the North or at the South.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>He holds like R. Yosi (one Paroches) but the Shulchanos were arranged such that they blocked his access.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Alternately, the Shulchanos were arranged East to West (and he <i>could</i> have walked along the North wall, but he holds like R. Meir that it is not Derech Eretz to walk straight into the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will R. Yosi relate to this Derech Eretz?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yisrael is precious, not needing an agent (see Rashi and Rach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yehudah, why did he not walk along the Southern wall (behind the Menorah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To avoid blackening his garments there.</p></div>
