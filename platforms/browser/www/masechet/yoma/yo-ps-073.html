<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE EIGHT GARMENTS OF THE KOHEN GADOL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Dimi):</span> These same garments are worn by the Kohen Mashu'ach Milchamah during his daily Avodah (this additional Kohen is learned from the extra word "Acharav").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that would make the Kohen Mashu'ach Milchamah fitting to go into the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim (which hinges on Begadim) and his son should inherit his position, not as we are taught that the position does not pass to his son!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk requires that the person be primarily dedicated to the Ohel Mo'ed in order to confer the position on his son, thus excluding one whose anointment is primarily for battle.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that he does <i>not</i> wear the eight Begadim, nor the four of a Kohen Hedyot!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Then you have invalidated him from Avodah entirely!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rather, he <i>is</i> fitting for Avodah, but does not do so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He does not wear the Begadim of the Kohen Gadol out of concern for enmity (Eivah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He does not wear the four Begadim of a Kohen Hedyot owing to his elevated status.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But according to the Tana who is not concerned with enmity, he <i>should</i> be able to function, thus proving that he is <i>not</i> fit to function at all!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana who is not concerned with Eivah demonstrates this by allowing a former Kohen Gadol to continue to function.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>At the same time he does not permit the Kohen Mashu'ach Milchamah to function, thus demonstrating that the Torah does not permit him to function (and it is not only because of our concern for enmity).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is no Eivah when the other Kohen is at the same level, but for a lesser Kohen (the Mashu'ach Milchamah) to function would engender Eivah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>When R. Avahu reported R. Dimi's teaching (that the Mashu'ach Milchamah wears eight Begadim) citing R. Yochanan, R. Ami and R. Asi turned away from him (to indicate that R. Yochanan did not teach that Din).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Others say it was R. Chiya b. Aba who reported it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> I would understand why R. Ami and R. Asi could not openly state their disapproval of R. Avahu owing to his political position, but why could they not have spoken directly to R. Chiya b. Aba!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Yochanan (as cited by Ravin) actually taught that the Mashu'ach Milchamah wore the Urim ve'Tumim when going out to battle, and was thus consulted by the King (as supported in the Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CONSULTING THE URIM VETUMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is this accomplished?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The petitioner faces the Kohen Gadol, and the Kohen Gadol faces the Shechinah (the Shem ha'Meforash on the Choshen-Rashi).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The petitioner asks the request of David ha'Melech, and the Kohen Gadol responds (either with or without 'Ko Amar Hashem') 'Aleh ve'Hatzlach'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The petitioner may not ask his question in a full voice ("veSha'al <i>Lo"</i>) nor merely <i>think</i> the question, but rather utters it quietly, as Chanah spoke with Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He may not ask two questions at once, and if he does, the response comes to the first question (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we see that David received an answer to his <i>second</i> question!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">73b----------------------------------------73b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> David asked out of order (whether the city would turn him over to Shaul, and whether Shaul would come down to the city).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Shechinah corrected him by answering the second (properly the first) question.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>David then asked the second question properly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>When the matter is urgent (as by Shaul), both questions will receive an answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The decree of a Navi may be reversed (as by Yonah) but not that of the Urim ve'Tumim (proof text and Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was the prophecy regarding the Pilegesh be'Giv'ah (to go to battle with Binyamin) not fulfilled (and Many B'nei Yisrael fell in those two days)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They only asked if to go to battle, not if they would be victorious (proof text regarding the third day).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How would the answer appear?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan says the letters would stand out (in their place) and Resh Lakish says they would organize into words.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the names of the Shevatim are missing the letter 'Tzadi' 'Ches' and 'Kuf'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The names Avraham Yitzchak and Ya'akov also featured on the Choshen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we are still missing a 'Tes'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The words 'Shivtei Yeshurun' appeared there, as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that the operation of the Urim ve'Tumim was based on the level of Shechinah in the Kohen Gadol and so (according to Rashi) there is no need for the letters to stand out or to organize at all!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kohen would assist the Urim ve'Tumim to function.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ONLY A KING MAY ASK OR ONE WHO IS NEEDED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is this known?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is based on the Pasuk:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The referent of the Pasuk is the King.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"ve'Chol B'nei Yisrael" is the Mashu'ach Milchamah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"ve'Chol ha'Eidah" refers to the Sanhedrin.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK #8 YOM HAKIPURIM</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE RESTRICTIONS OF YOM KIPUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It is Asur on Yom Kipur to eat, drink, bath, anoint, wear shoes or cohabit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A King and a Kalah wash their face.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A nursing mother wears shoes; while R. Eliezer prohibits.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>One who eats the equivalent of a plump dried date (Koseves) with its pit is Chayav, as is one who drinks a cheek-full (Malei Lugmav).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Foods combine with other foods as do liquids with others, but foods and liquids do not combine.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>CHATZI SHIUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah should have referred to the Isur as 'Chayav Kareis' (not merely 'Asur')!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means to refer to Chatzi Shiur (Asur, but not Kareis).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what of Resh Lakish who holds (in his Machlokes with R. Yochanan) that Chatzi Shiur is <i>Mutar</i> from the Torah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Resh Lakish admits that Chatzi Shiur is Asur mi'de'Rabanan (and thus the Mishnah refers to it as 'Asur').</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But then how can Resh Lakish explain that his Shevu'ah applies to his eating less than a Shiur (according to Rabanan, in the following discussion from Shevu'os), given that he is already bound not to eat this!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who takes a Shevu'ah not to eat, and violates his oath by eating forbidden foods, according to Rabanan, is Chayav for violating his Shevu'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to R. Shimon he is Patur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Gemara there asks why he is Chayav, since he is already under oath from Har Sinai, and his Shevu'ah should not take hold!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The Gemara there provides two answers:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rav, Shmuel and R. Yochanan explain that he is Chayav because he included <i>permitted</i> foods in his oath, and was thus able to be bound even regarding forbidden foods ('Isur Kolel', while R. Shimon holds that such a Kolel cannot cause the Shevu'ah to apply to the Isur).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Resh Lakish explained that he can be Chayav (even though a Shevu'ah cannot apply to any Isur, even Kolel) in one of two ways:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>He specifies in his Shevu'ah that he will not eat Chatzi Shiur (according to Rabanan who hold that one who does not specify means to prohibit only a full Shiur, and thus only one who specifies less will become prohibited in less); or,</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>He does not specify (according to R. Akiva who holds that one who does not specify means to include even a minimal amount).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>According to Resh Lakish who holds that there is an Isur mi'de'Rabanan on Chatzi Shiur, how can the Rabanan hold that his Shevu'ah can apply to less than a Shiur (even if he is explicit) given his standing prohibition!?</p></div>
