<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>AGADIC TEACHINGS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>"Ki Yiten be'Kos Eino..." - One who likes drunkenness justifies forbidden relations or theft (Machlokes R. Ami and R. Asi).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>"De'agah be'Lev Ish, Yashchenah... " - A person should push his worries out of his thoughts, or he should speak them out with a friend (Machlokes R. Ami and R. Asi).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>"ve'Nachash Afar Lachmo... " - All foods taste like dust for the snake, or, after the finest delicacies, the snake is only satisfied with dust (Machlokes R. Ami and R. Asi).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Hash-m deals more graciously with those who annoy him than a person would.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The snake, though cursed, finds benefit within the curse, as do slaves (Cana'anites), women, and the earth.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE TEARS OF THE JEWS OVER THE MANNA IN THE MIDBAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>"Zacharnu Es ha'Dagah... " - We fondly recall the fish, or, the permitted (now forbidden) relations (Rav and Shmuel).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Fish, since it says "Nochal" (we ate).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Arayos, since it says "Chinam".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Nochal" could still refer to Arayos, in a dignified way.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"Chinam" could still refer to fish, since they came to them from Hefker (Hash-m placed the fish in their water buckets).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they were involved in Arayos, why does Shlomoh praise their chastity (Shir ha'Shirim 4- "Gan Na'ul...")?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were chaste regarding the previously forbidden relations (and were crying over the new prohibitions).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they missed the fish, why were they crying "le'Mishpechosav" implying a concern over conjugal relations?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were crying over both, fish and Arayos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE MANNA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>"Es ha'Kishuim... " - The Manna imparted all flavor except these five, or, it imparted all flavors and became all textures, except these five (R. Ami and R. Asi).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>"ve'Hu ke'Zera Gad Lavan" (R. Asi) - Its shape was like the Zera Gad (round) and it was white as a pearl.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Gad" - similar to a Pishtan seed be'Givolin (round).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Gad" - likened to Hagadah, (Agad'ta) which draws the hearts (Libo) of its listeners (so did the Manna whet a person's appetite)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Gad" - It told (Magid) and resolved a doubt regarding the child whose mother remarried prematurely.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"Lavan" - It whitened the Aveiros of Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Manna, like a Navi, would reveal the secrets of the people (as in revealing which person or servant belongs to which household or whether a woman was still a loyal part of her husband's household).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>"u'Ve'redes ha'Tal... " (implies the Manna fell within the Machaneh) "ve'Yatza ha'Am ve'Laktu... " (implies that it fell <i>outside</i>) "Shatu ha'Am ve'Laktu... " (implies a considerable distance).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Tzadikim received it near their homes, Beinonim went out and Resha'im had to go a distance for theirs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>"Lechem" (implies it was found in a baked state) "ve'Asu Oso Ugos" (that they had to prepare and bake it) "ve'Tachanu" (implies an even earlier state, requiring milling).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Again, Tzadikim, Beinonim and Resha'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>"O Dachu ba'Meduchah... " - Women's perfumes (adornments which are pulverized) came down with the Manna.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>"u'Vishlu ba'Parur... " - with its spices for the cooked food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>"ve'Hemi Heivi'u Od Nedavah <i>ba'Boker ba'Boker"</i> - They brought gems from the <i>daily</i> shower which accompanied the Manna (as "Nesi'im" refers to the <i>clouds</i> which brought the gems).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>"ve'Hayah Ta'amo ke'Ta'am L'shad Hashemen" - (The Manna had many flavors, like a child experiences in nursing [Shad], alternately like a Sheid (demon) which has many forms, so, too did the Manna change to many flavors).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE REQUESTS FOR BREAD AND MEAT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua b. Korchah):</span> They requested meat improperly and it was given in an improper fashion, whereas bread was requested properly, and given in kind.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">75b----------------------------------------75b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This instructs a person to eat meat at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Abaye taught that a festive meal should be eaten by day!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant by torch-light (<i>like</i> daylight).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The people used to eat (peck away at) their food all day, until Moshe established meal times.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE SLAV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One Pasuk says they died during their first bite and another teaches that they received the S'lav for 30 days!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beinonim died right away while the Resha'im lingered in their suffering up to a month.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> Understand the word "va'Yisht'chu" to imply 've'Yishchatu', meaning the people were Chayavim on account of their improper request for meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua b. Korchah):</span> "Shato'ach" implies 'Shachut'; the Manna was accompanied by that which required Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We surely have other sources for the requirement to perform Shechitah on a bird (as learned in the Beraisa regarding the Simanim of an animal and a bird)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, "Shato'ach" refers to the carpet of 'S'lav'.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MANNA (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can the same thing be Lechem, Shemen and D'vash?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Lechem for young people, Shemen for the older people and D'vash for the infants.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>SLAV (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The word begins with a Shin/Sin and is read with a Samech to indicate Shalvah (for Tzadikim) and Silvin (thorns, for the Resha'im).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Chanin b. Rava lists four types of S'lav, noting the best and worst of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>It was a small bird which would be stuffed and roasted in an oven, and it would expand from the great quantity of oil within it such that it would even permeate 13 loaves of bread and the bottom loaf would need diluting in order to be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah was granted such birds between his barrels, R. Chisda found them among his trees and Rava's sharecropper would bring him one each day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One day the Aris did not bring the S'lav, and Rava interpreted the signs (the call of the child and the absence of the S'lav) to know that R. Chisda had passed away.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Now that his Rebbi had passed away, Rava felt that he no longer had the merit to eat S'lav.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>TAL AND MANNA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>From the seemingly contradictory Pesukim we learn that there was dew above and below the Manna.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>"Dak Mechuspas... " abbreviates that which melts in the palm of the hand (Resh Lakish), or, that which is retained in 248 body parts (like the numerical value of "Mechuspas" - R. Yochanan).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Mechuspas (254) is greater in number than 248?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is written without the Vav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>"Lechem Abirim... " - The Manna is the food of the Mal'achim (R. Akiva).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yishmael indicated that R. Akiva had erred, since Mal'achim do not eat, but, rather, "Abirim" refers to the Eivarim into which the Manna is absorbed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why, if it was entirely absorbed, was there need for privies (as in the Pasuk)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was from the food that the itinerant merchants would sell them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar b. Parta):</span> Even that food was absorbed on account of the Manna.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The privy was needed after they committed Aveiros.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Hash-m had said that they were to be like Mal'achim, but now they must be troubled with such bodily needs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They had to walk three Parsah to the privy as Rabah bar bar Chanah reported.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>When they used the privy they went to the rear of the Ananim (since the Ananim never went backwards, so they did not need to worry there that they would suddenly find themselves inside the Machaneh).</p></div>
