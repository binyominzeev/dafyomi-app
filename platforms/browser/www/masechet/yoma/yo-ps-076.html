<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>"ve'Ata Nafsheinu Yeveishah..." - They were concerned that they would die from the food which they did not excrete. (R. Yishmael's teaching is deleted here by the <b>GRA</b>.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>"Lechem Abirim Achal Ish... " - This is Yehoshua for whom Manna fell (Yehoshua is called 'Ish' and is equated with all of Klal Yisrael).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Ish" refers to Moshe, about whom it says "ve'ha'Ish"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to connect to "Ish".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (students of R. Shimon b. Yochai):</span> Why didn't the Manna fall once for the whole year?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mashal to a King (Hash-m)... who established a daily dependant relationship with his son (the large families of Klal Yisrael).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answers:</span> So that it would be warm and fresh or, to lighten their load.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Elazar ha'Moda'i stated (before the Chachamim) that the Manna was 60 Amos high.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Chachamim were not, at first, pleased, until R. Elazar justified his innovation based on the Pesukim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He made the calculation based on the four times 15 Amos of water which came down during the Mabul (Midas Pur'aniyos from <i>two</i> Arubos), and inferred the Midah Tovah of the Manna as greater than that disaster (eight Arubos- two Dalsos each with four Arubos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Isi b. Yehudah):</span> The Manna rose until all the Kingdoms of East and West could see it (as implied by the Pasuk in Tehilim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> "Kosi Revayah... " The size of the future cup of David ha'Melech.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (on R. Elazar ha'Moda'i):</span> But the measure came by the flood in 40 days (960 hours), and here we are speaking of that which fell in one hour!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Further Question:</span> The flood covered the entire world, and here it all fell on the Machaneh Yisrael!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar ha'Moda'i was speaking of the Pesichah (initial opening) of the Arubos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE FIVE INUYIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How are these Inuyim alluded to in the Torah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The five references to <i>Inuy</i> in the Pesukim, as listed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there are <i>six</i> Inuyim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Eating and drinking are counted as one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know this?]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Resh Lakish derives this from the fact that the Torah uses the word "ve'Achalta" when one of the items referred to is wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the wine was part of a food dish?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the source is "ve'Nasata ha'Kesef... ba'Yayin u'va'Sheichar... ve'Achalta" (beverage spoken of as Achilah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps, this, too refers to Anigron?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk refers to an intoxicating beverage (not a food ingredient, thus that drinking is part of Achilah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find illustrations of intoxicating foods (Deveilah Ka'ilis)!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">76b----------------------------------------76b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we learn from Nazir who is forbidden to drink wine (Sheichar), so, too, here, by Ma'aser Sheini we are speaking of wine, not an ingredient.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But "Tirosh" is grapes, not wine as we find that one who makes a Neder to abstain from Tirosh is forbidden to eat sweet fruits, but is <i>permitted</i> to drink wine!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We suggest three Pesukim indicating that "Tirosh" is, indeed, wine, two of which are rejected.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, "Tirosh" is wine, and the reason for the permission regarding Nedarim is because people do not generally refer to wine as 'Tirosh' and we thus interpret the words of his Neder to refer to sweet fruit.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is wine called by two names, "Yayin" and "Tirosh"?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Yayin' brings Yelalah; 'Tirosh' brings poverty (Rash) to its adherents.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Kehana):</span> How may we resolve the K'siv ("Tirash") with the K'ri ("Tirosh")?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One who is Zocheh (drinks in proper measure) becomes a Rosh; one who is not becomes a pauper (Rashi).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> How may we resolve the K'siv ("Yishmach") with the K'ri ("Yismach")?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If drunk in proper measure is gladdens ("Yismach"); if not, it destroys ("Yishmach").</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span><p>As Rava stated 'Wine and fragrance (in their proper measure) contributed to my wisdom'</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>LEARNING RECHITZAH FROM SICHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that washing and anointing are called Inuyim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the mourning of Daniel, "Lechem Chamudos Lo Achalti... ve'Shoch Lo Sachti".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the "Lechem Chamudos" from which he refrained?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Bread made from clean flour.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that "Soch Lo Sachti" means Inuy?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From Gavriel's assurance to Daniel ("Lehis'anos").</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That covers Sichah, but what of Rechitzah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk in Tehilim equates water on the skin to anointing with oil.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe the anointing in the Pasuk is like drinking?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk implies that the water came into his system similarly to oil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Tana in Shabbos learns oil <i>from</i> water (that Sichah is like drinking) not water from oil!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah there asks how we know that Sichah is forbidden like drinking on Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In response, the Tana quotes the very same Pasuk in Tehilim, "va'Tavo ka'Mayim... ".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Rechitzah is implicit in the words "ve'Soch Lo Sachti" in Daniel.</p></div>
