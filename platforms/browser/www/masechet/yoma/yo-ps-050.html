<p class="dedicationbox">YOMA 50 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE PAR AND NOT ITS BLOOD OR EVEN WITH ITS BLOOD (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Pasuk refers to the Par after Zerikah as a Par!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That means the requirement to take out the entire Par.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Par ha'Chatas is called a Par!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> There is no argument that the Torah refers to the entirety of the animal as Par; the argument is whether the blood alone can be called Par.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Ashi brought an indication from the Par of the Kohen Gadol on Yom Kipur that the blood is called Par.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Perhaps it means that the Par (once live and offered properly) is what enables Aharon to enter.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>USING THE BLOOD OF THE PAR AFTER THE KOHEN DIES (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should be a Chatas whose owners have died (which must be killed as one of the five Chatos ha'Meisos)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravin b. R. Ada speaking to Rava citing the latter's student, R. Amram):</span> It is a Chatas ha'Tzibur which is not le'Misa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir in the Mishnah asserts that it is a Korban Yachid [and yet is Docheh Shabbos and <i>Tum'ah</i>].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>From R. Meir we infer the existence of an opposing opinion, i.e. that it is a Korban Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If you make such an inference, then you would have to infer from R. Ya'akov (in that Mishnah) the existence of an opinion that Par He'elam, Sa'irei Avodas Kochavim and Chagigah are Korbanos Yachid!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rather, both R. Meir and R. Ya'akov are addressing the Tana Kama who holds that being Docheh Shabbos and <i>Tum'ah</i> depends on being a Korban Tzibur (and not a Korban Yachid).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>They are asserting that neither is a determinant, but rather a fixed time for the Korban determines whether or not it is Docheh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye to Rava):</span> We find that the Par of Yom Kipur is a Chatas ha'Tzibur and yet there is a doubt whether the second Kohen may enter with the blood of the first!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> No, it is a Korban Yachid and the Par being referred to is the Par He'elam of the Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says <i>of Yom Kipur</i>?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to the Sa'ir (but the Par is Par He'elam).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa explicitly lists both!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is not a Chatas ha'Tzibur, but rather a Chatas ha'Shutfin, which does not go le'Misah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why fuss over the difference?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need to be precise so that Kohanim should not bring a Par He'elam because they are Shutfin, not a Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TEMURAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The above establishes that there <i>is</i> an opinion that Par of Yom Kipur is a Korban Tzibur as indicated by the question asked by R. Elazar, as to whether, according to R. Meir, it can create a Temurah?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">50b----------------------------------------50b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He refers to R. Meir as holding that the Par of Yom Kipur is a Korban Yachid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This infers the existence of an opinion that it is a Korban Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>No, this may infer the opinion that it is a Korban Shutfin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was R. Elazar's doubt?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The doubt may not relate to the question of whether we consider the donor (the Kohen Gadol) or the ones atoned (the Kohanim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Such a doubt is not legitimate since it would be clear that we follow the ones atoned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is true, given the Halachos regarding Temurah and Terumah which R. Avahu cited in R. Yochanan's name.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As to whether or not the Kohanim, his brethren, fully take ownership of the Korban (Keviyusa) or does the atonement hover over them (Kufia), thus affecting Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Beraisa lists the Chumros of Zevach over Temurah and the opposite.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What type of Zevach does the Beraisa speak of?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be a Zevach Yachid, since we speak of it being Docheh Shabbos and <i>Tum'ah</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It cannot be Tzibur, since we speak of it creating a Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>It must be speaking of a Par Yom Kipur which is Docheh (since it is time-specific), and it makes a Temurah (since it is considered owned by an individual).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Thus we see that it can make a Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Sheishes):</span> No, it may well speak of the Ayil of Aharon on Yom Kipur (not the Par Chatas).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is indicated by the reference to Zevach having the Chumrah of Dechiyah over a Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Temurah of a Chatas is <i>never</i> brought (not only on Shabbos) since it is le'Misah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Not necessarily, since it may not speak of the Temurah of <i>that animal</i> but rather of general Temuros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, then Zevach may also be generic!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa does not say the generic Zevach, rather it is specific.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it meant a generic Zevach then its Chumrah would not hold given Bechor and Ma'aser Beheimah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Those do apply to Ba'al Mum, and they do not go out le'Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Beraisa speak of a specific Zevach and yet use the term Temurah generically?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because all Temuros have like Halachos, whereas Zevachim have the exceptional Bechor and Ma'aser.</p></div>
