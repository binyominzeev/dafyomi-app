<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE REVENGE OF THE TALMID CHACHAM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Talmid Chacham must take revenge and bear a grudge like a snake.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what of the Torah prohibition?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is speaking in money matters (as the examples of Nekimah and Netirah indicate).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa speaks of letting go of vengeful thoughts even in personal (non-financial) matters?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Talmid Chacham is permitted to bear it (only) in his heart.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rava taught that it is praiseworthy to overlook even such slights!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That speaks of his willingness to forgive when approached.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PUTTING OUT FINGERS IN THE PAYIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If two fingers are permitted, then certainly one!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One speaks of a healthy Kohen (only permitted to put out one) and the other of an ill Kohen (does not have the dexterity to put out one) as we learn in the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We count the two fingers of the ill Kohen as one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa implies that we count it as two (while the one who puts out a thumb is not counted as two, but is rather struck with a Pakia)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means we count the ill Kohen as one, and we do not count the thumb-user at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Pakia?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Midra.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Midra?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> It is a whip with strands at the end.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> I used to think that Ben Bibai was in charge of wicks (Pakia), but now I see that it means the whip.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TRAGEDY ON THE KEVESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There was a tragic incident wherein a Kohen stabbed the winner of a Kevesh-race.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Tzadok brought the People to tears with his call regarding the Eglah Arufah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The victim's father found his son still in his death throes:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He said that the son is their atonement.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He said that the knife could still be removed before becoming Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This teaches the relative importance of <i>Tum'ah</i> and bloodshed in the eyes of the people (as in the Pasuk regarding the time of Menasheh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which incident came first (this or the Mishnah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was this one, why didn't the Takanah follow?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was the Mishnah, then how did this one happen?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The murder came first, but was regarded as an isolated incident; while the Mishnah triggered the Takanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Eglah Arufah did R. Tzadok refer to?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Among the ten qualities of Yerushalayim is that an Eglah Arufah is not brought from there.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Also, an Eglah Arufah refers to an unsolved murder, not to this incident where the murderer is known?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was speaking to elicit the people's tears.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Had bloodshed become worthless or had Taharas Keilim become precious?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Given the reference to Menasheh, we may conclude that bloodshed had lost significance.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE GARMENTS OF THE KOHEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>"Ufashat" indicates a change of garments as on Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>In this case, a change to Chol garments.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Acherim thus corrects this assumption, that the change is into Kadosh garments.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then how are they 'Acherim' from the first set?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are shabbier than the first, but still Kadosh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Eliezer):</span> "Acherim" refers to the person, teaching that a Ba'al Mum may take out the Deshen (the Chachamim say that a Ba'al-Mum may not take out the Deshen).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Regarding the first answer, we were taught in a Beraisa that it is proper to change from the cooking to the serving garments, to thus honor the Master.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>There is a Machlokes if the dispute between R. Eliezer and Chachamim also applies to taking the Terumah (Resh Lakish) or is restricted to taking the Deshen out (R. Yochanan).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale of Resh Lakish?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Terumas ha'Deshen must not be an Avodah, since the Torah speaks of its performance with <i>two</i> garments.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will R. Yochanan do with this Pasuk?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The two garments infer the presence of all four.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why, then, are these two singled out?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mido" teaches that it must be a correct fit; "Michnesei Bad" teaches that they must be the first garments donned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence will Resh Lakish learn these Halachos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mido" (versus Ketones) teaches the first; "Al Besaro" teaches the second.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this Machlokes regarding the status of the Terumas ha'Deshen as an Avodah has a precedent between the Tanaim (R. Yehudah and R. Dosa)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that "Yilbash" teaches that the four garments are required for Haramah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Dosa holds that "Yilbash" the four garments of the Kohen Gadol may be used by a Kohen Hedyot.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> But the Avnet of a Kohen Gadol differs from that of a Kohen Hedyot?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> How can garments be used for a lesser Kedushah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Rather, Yilbash allows the use of worn (but not torn) garments.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>The dispute over whether the Bigdei Kohen Gadol may be used by a Kohen Hedyot derives from "ve'Hinicham Sham", teaching that they must be placed in Genizah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>R. Dosa holds that they may be used by a Kohen Hedyot and the Pasuk teaches that they may not be reused by the Kohen Gadol on a subsequent Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>Would it not, then, appear that R. Yehudah holds that Terumas ha'Deshen <i>is</i> Avodah, and R. Dosa holds it is not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, they may both hold that it <i>is</i> Avodah, but R. Yehudah holds that we need a Pasuk to add the Mitznefes and Avnet (to the two listed) while R. Dosa holds that we do not need a Pasuk to add them.</p></div>
