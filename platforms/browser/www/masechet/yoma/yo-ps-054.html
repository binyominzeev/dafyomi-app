<p class="dedicationbox">YOMA 54 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WAS THE ARON HIDDEN OR EXILED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah implies that the Aron was exiled.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>There are two opinions (R. Eliezer and R. Shimon b. Yochai) which maintain that it was exiled (based on two different Pesukim) and one which maintains that it was hidden in its place, and remains so, based on the words "Ad ha'Yom ha'Zeh".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to Ula, R. Shimon b. Yochai is of the opinion that the Aron is hidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Ula reported an exchange between R. Masia b. Charash and R. Shimon b. Yochai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are all occurrences of "Ad ha'Yom ha'Zeh" meant to be taken literally?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Pasuk speaks of the Yevusi living in Yerushalyaim "Ad ha'Yom ha'Zeh".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We know from Yirmeyahu that there were 52 years of total desolation (like the numerical value of 'Beheimah').</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We also know (from R. Yosi in the Beraisa) that Gafris and Melach alone reigned in Eretz Yisrael for seven years (compare "B'ris"-"B'ris").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The word "Sham" adds the real impression of forever.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find an instance of "va'Yeishev Sham" which was interrupted by Sancheriv?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Good question.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHERE WAS THE ARON HIDDEN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Chachamim (cited by R. Nachman) taught that the Aron is beneath the wood-checking Lishkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A tragic incident reported in the Beraisa supports the claim that the Aron is not beneath the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In the incident a Kohen, engaged in another activity, died while trying to point out the place of the Aron to the other Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was that Kohen doing?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was using his ax (as confirmed by the tragic incident reported by a Tana d'bei R. Yishmael).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE VISIBLE/INVISIBLE BADIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The (cited) Pesukim seem to contradict one another?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Badim were both visible and invisible.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Further, they miraculously extended in order to be visible from without.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The refrained from extending too far (which would tear the Paroches) and only pushed out slightly, like a woman's breasts through her garment.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE INTIMATE BOND BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND HASH-M</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Katina):</span> The bond was revealed to the people by opening the Paroches during Aliyas Regel (the embracing Keruvim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Pasuk teaches that the Keilim of the Mishkan may not be seen!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishkan was likened to a Kalah before her wedding while the Beis ha'Mikdash was like a Kalah after her wedding.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find that a Kohen was killed in order to prevent the possible exposure of the Aron!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was during the second Mikdash, when the remarried wife is, again, like the Kalah before the Chupah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then R. Katina's teaching cannot apply to either Mikdash!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Beis ha'Mikdash did not have a Paroches.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The second Beis ha'Mikdash did not have Keruvim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He spoke of the first Beis ha'Mikdash and the Paroches refer to the (many door) coverings (as enumerated).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> He spoke of the second Beis ha'Mikdash and they showed the people the Keruvim as part of the wall decorations.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Those Keruvim were very noticeable as supported by two Pesukim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The second of those Pesukim refers to the Keruvim as being made "ke'Ma'ar Ish ve'Loyos".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>What is "ke'Ma'ar Ish ve'Loyos"?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">54b----------------------------------------54b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Like a man embracing his wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The destroyers of the Mikdash mocked the intimate Keruvim (thus fulfilling the prophecy of "Kol Mechabdehah Hiziluhah").</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE EVEN HASHESIYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It was called 'Shesiyah' because the world was founded on it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is consistent with view of Chachamim that the world was created from Tzion.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is a four-way Machlokes in the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer (it was created from its center), R. Yehoshua (it was created from its sides), R. Yitzhok (from the stone which Hash-m fired into the sea), and the Chachamim (from Tzion).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Eliezer ha'Gadol taught that the Shamayim was created from Shamayim and the Aretz from Aretz, while the Chachamim say that they were both created from Tzion.</p></div>
