<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Nachtomin are exempt from all tithes except Terumas Ma'aser and Chalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A logic is given for each exemption, except as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are they exempt from separating and bringing Ma'aser Sheini to Yerushalayim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chazal were lenient because of the oppressive market conditions (created by the Parhadrin) the Nachtomin worked under.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND BAYIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The first Mikdash stood for 410 years and there were only 18 Kohanim Gedolim (the longevity mentioned in the Pasuk).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The second Mikdash had more than 300 Kohanim Gedolim in 420 years (R. Yochanan goes on to make the calculation that none of the later Kohanim Gedolim survived the year).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Shiloh was destroyed because...(proof texts for each)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Gilui Arayos [not really the Aveirah as implied].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Bizayon Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The first Mikdash was destroyed because... (proof texts from Yeshayah and Melachim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Avodah Zarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Gilui Arayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Shefichus Damim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The second Mikdash, where there was Torah, Mitzvos and Gemilus Chasadim, was destroyed on account of Sinas Chinam.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa which says that their Bitachon was false is speaking of the first Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Three punishments (all related to the destruction of Yerushalayim) followed in the wake of the sins committed with confidence that Hash-m would not make retribution.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it seems from Yechezkel that the first Mikdash <i>did</i> have Sinas Chinam!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was speaking only of the leadership.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>To those (first Mikdash) whose Aveiros were revealed by the Pasuk, the end to their exile was also revealed, whereas the second Mikdash...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The earlier ones (first Mikdash) were better.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> No, we are better (for we study Torah even in the face of foreign dominion).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>The return of the Mikdash seems to support R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>RESH LAKISH AND THE BABYLONIAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Resh Lakish indicated to Rabah bar bar Chanah his hatred for the Babylonians for not coming en masse to Eretz Yisrael during the days of Ezra.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Had they done so, the Mikdash would not have been subject to deterioration (we are not silver but rather cedar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The rotting of the cedar is a Mashal to Bas Kol (remaining vestige of prophecy).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But surely Resh Lakish would not have spoken with Rabah bar bar Chanah (who was of a lesser stature than R. Elazar, with whom Resh Lakish would not speak in public)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer: (R. Papa):</span> Names in the story need to be changed.</p></div>
