<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar b'R. Shimon in the Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi b'R. Yehudah- from the Mizbe'ach to the North wall is considered North.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar b'R. Shimon adds between the Ulam and the Mizbe'ach as part of North.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rebbi adds the North<i>east</i>ern side of the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>All agree not to include the far Northwestern side (by the Ulam-Beis ha'Chalifos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must our Mishnah only follow R. Elazar b'R. Shimon and not Rebbi?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely Rebbi <i>adds</i> to R. Elazar b'R. Shimon!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We meant to ask why, according to Rebbi, do we only locate the Parah between the Ulam and the Mizbe'ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just as you will admit for R. Elazar b'R. Shimon that we minimize the exertion of the Kohen, so, too, we will say for Rebbi.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then stand the Parah facing West?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned for the honor of the Mizbe'ach if its tail is to the East.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SEMICHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is the Semichah done on Kodshei Kodshim?</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The animal is in the North, facing West, as is the Somech.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He places both hands between its horns and there must not be anything intervening between him and the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>For a Chatas and an Asham he confesses the Avon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>For an Olah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> He confesses transgressing Leket, Shikchah and Pe'ah.</p></div>

<div class="bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmiyah):</span> Whether the Lav regarding Neveilah is a regular Lav (R. Akiva) or not a regular Lav (R. Yosi ha'Gelili) since there is also an Asei relating to it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Whether "Ta'azov" means only before the Aveirah (R. Akiva) or is it an instruction even for after the offense is committed (R. Yosi ha'Gelili).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE ORDER OF THE VIDUI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> The order is as in our Mishnah, based on the Pasuk by the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach as well as in the 13 Midos which Moshe confessed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> The order is 'Chatasi, Avisi, Pashati' since the other order has him confessing lighter transgressions later.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what of the order in Moshe's plea?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asked that Hash-m consider Zedonos as Shegagos when the people do Teshuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah b. Shmuel citing Rav):</span> The Halachah follows the Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is obvious (Yachid ve'Rabim)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have been in doubt seeing that R. Meir finds support from the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>In the reported incident, Rabah corrected the Sh'liach Tzibur who followed R. Meir, however the Sh'liach Tzibur insisted on following R. Meir.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>This Kaparah is with words (Vidui).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Gezeirah Shavah to Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach shows me that it cannot mean with the blood (but must be words).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>And if you insist, I will demonstrate from 16:10 that the Kaparah is referenced even before the Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this  'If you insist'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If you would wish to learn from the Sa'ir of a Chatas that Kaparah means its blood (which is sprinkled), I'll demonstrate from the Par itself.</p></div>
