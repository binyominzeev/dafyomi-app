<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah cites the Vidui by Eglah Arufah and it does <i>not</i> include 'Ana'?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have thought that the Goralos, like the Tzitz bearing the Name, must be of gold.</p></div>
