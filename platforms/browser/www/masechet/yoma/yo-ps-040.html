<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TWO LESHONOS AS TO WHETHER THE GORAL IS ME'AKEV (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa teaches that Hagralah is a Mitzvah which is <i>not</i> Me'akev?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This fits nicely according to the first Lashon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to the second Lashon, however, there is an opinion which maintains that Hagralah <i>is</i> Me'akev!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is correctly taught that <i>Hanachah</i> is a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that it is a Mitzvah to do both Goral and Vidui, but that neither are Me'akev, and here the Goral <i>cannot</i> mean Hanachah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon disagrees and holds that Vidui <i>is</i> Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This reading implies that R. Shimon concurs that the Goral is <i>not</i> Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Goral here means Hanachah, then R. Shimon would hold that our Goral (Aliyah) <i>is</i> Me'akev (Yet, R. Shimon holds that it is <i>not</i> Me'akev as we see from the case where one of the Se'irim died)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon was unsure of the position of the Rabanan and taught his position that both Hagralah and Vidui are Me'akev regardless of what the Rabanan mean by Hagralah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>We see the positions of R. Shimon and R. Yehudah as two alternate explanations for the Beraisa regarding the order of the Par and Sa'ir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that preempting the Par with Avodah of the Sa'ir is Me'akev that Sa'ir, but the reverse is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>What is being referred to as the Par before the Sa'ir?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It cannot be the Matanos of the Par in the Heichal before the Matanos bi'F'nim, since "Chukah" does not allow for error there.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>It must be the Matanos of the Par bi'F'nim before the Goralos, thus indicating R. Shimon's position that the Goralos are not Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Alternately, it could be R. Yehudah's position, and while the order is not Me'akev, Hagralah is.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">40b----------------------------------------40b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>We see the positions of R. Shimon and R. Yehudah regarding the indispensable nature of Vidui inferred from the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Pasuk "Yo'omad Chai" is understood by R. Yehudah to mean until the Matan Dam of the other Sa'ir, while R. Shimon takes it to mean until the Vidui.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah learns that the Kaparah of the Pasuk is Kaparas Damim while R. Shimon learns that the Kaparah is Devarim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> From R. Akiva's response to his students it seems that (had it not been for our concern over the Tzedukim that) the Goral is <i>not</i> Me'akev (contrary to what we have been taught)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They actually asked about moving the left Sa'ir and the Goral to his right side, and to that R. Akiva said no, because of the Tzedokim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> From the Beraisa (explaining the word "<i>Alav</i>") it seems that Hagralah is Me'akev and that Hanachah is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, "<i>Alav</i>" teaches that once we know which animal is which, it is purely a Mitzvah to place the Goral on the animal, and still, both Aliyah and Hanachah may not be Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa (a Sifra-Toras Kohanim) teaches that the <i>Goral</i> makes the Kedushah, and not the Kohen's words?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is taught to counter the effect of a Kal va'Chomer which one might encourage us to learn that the Name <i>should</i> make it a Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Pasuk thus teaches that it is the Goral creating the Chatas, and not the Name.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>An unnamed Sifra is the position of R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>We thus resolve conclusively in favor of those who hold that Hagralah <i>is</i> Me'akev.</p></div>
