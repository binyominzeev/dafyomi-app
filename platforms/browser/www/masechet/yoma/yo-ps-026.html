<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE THIRD AND FOURTH PAYIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Those who had never performed the Ketores were invited to the third Payis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The fourth Payis, to bring the Eivarim from the Kevesh onto the Mizbe'ach, was open to all.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE UNIQUE KETORES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There was always a Kohen who had not yet done the Ketores.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not let a Kohen win the Ketores twice?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because it brought wealth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is that so?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be from the Berachah of Moshe, since, if so;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Olah should also be restricted to one time.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>No, the Olah is more frequent than the Ketores.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OTHER GLEANINGS FROM THE BERACHAH OF MOSHE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One who is Moreh Halachah must be from Levi or Yisachar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he could also be from Yehudah, who is called "Mechokek"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> While Yehudah had great scholars, Levi and Yisachar were blessed with learning Torah to its Halachah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PAYIS FOR THE AFTERNOON TAMID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Kohen who won a task in the Tamid of Shacharis, wins it for the Bein ha'Arbayim, as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that there was another Payis?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was for the <i>Ketores</i> Bein ha'Arbayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa uses the masculine 'Lo'!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Teach the Beraisa with 'Lah', referring to Ketores.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But a Beraisa specifies both the Tamid and the Ketores!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is speaking on Shabbos (when the Mishmaros are replaced before the afternoon Tamid).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could we have thought there was a second Payis, since that would make <i>five</i>, not <i>four</i> Paysos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both Paysos would have been done in the morning.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE FOURTH PAYIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Our Mishnah, which assigns the task of bringing Eivarim from the Kevesh to the Mizbe'ach, argues with R. Eliezer b. Ya'akov who holds that the same Kohen who brings it <i>to</i> the Kevesh later brings it on to the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is their dispute?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana holds be'Rov Am, and R. Eliezer b. Ya'akov holds that it is impolite to leave a job unfinished in the presence of the Shechinah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Eliezer b. Ya'akov holds, unlike R. Yehudah (25b), that there was a <i>separate</i> Payis for the Machtah, and R. Yehudah holds, unlike R. Eliezer b. Ya'akov, that there <i>was</i> a Payis for bringing the Eivarim onto the Mizbe'ach, for otherwise, the count of each would be off (and any Tana who holds that there were five, disagrees with both of them).</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MISHNAH: POSSIBLE PARTICIPANTS IN THE TAMID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Tamid could be, at times, brought by 9-12 Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>As before, nine Kohanim are always needed, while additions come from:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Sukos- a Kohen brought the water.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Bein ha'Arbayim- two Kohanim brought the Gizrei Eitzim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Shabbos- two brought the Bazichei Levonah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Shabbos and Sukos, combine to make 12.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>NISUCH HAMAYIM AT THE AFTERNOON TAMID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Nisuch must be only at Shacharis, since otherwise there could be 12 even on a weekday during Sukos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A Beraisa supports this, citing the incident of the Tzeduki who was pelted with Esrogim (at Shacharis) for desecrating the Nisuch.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>TWO KOHANIM WITH THE GIZREI EITZIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa teaches the source as "ve'Archu Eitzim".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is not needed for the Tamid of Shacharis (since we already were taught "u'Vi'er ... "), and thus informs the afternoon Tamid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps both Pesukim speak of Shacharis?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Then the Torah would have repeated the same word.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But perhaps the change of language is to teach that the first wood is brought by one, and the second by two?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Then the Torah would have used the same word, first in singular, then in plural, either "Bi'er" or "Arach".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>OTHER PERMUTATIONS FOR THE TAMID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that there could be 13-16 Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we have a Beraisa which teaches 17?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa disagrees with R. Eliezer b. Ya'akov (and holds like R. Yehudah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>MISHNAH: TASKS FOR THE OTHER ANIMALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>An Ayil (as an Olah) was brought by 11, as detailed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A Par (Olah) was brought by 24, as detailed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>These numbers are for Korbanos Tzibur, whereas a Korban Yachid could be brought by a single Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Hefshet and Nituach of both types of Korbanos can be done by a Zar.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">11)</span><p>HEFSHET AND NITUACH BY A ZAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this permission?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Chizkiyah):</span> Since the Torah mentions the Kohanim only once it speaks of putting on the flame.</p></div>
