<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE GENERAL RULE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(Mishnah - Chachamim):... For the lower Siman can come before the upper Siman, but not vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learned this (in the Reisha)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is to teach that this is the majority opinion, so the Halachah follows it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We already know that, for an individual (R. Meir) argues with it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> One might have thought that the Halachah follows R. Meir, for verses (seem to) support him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Tana ended with this general rule to show the connection to the coming Mishnayos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOLES IN <i>KLEI CHERES</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, any Kli Cheres (earthenware vessel) that is Kones Mashkeh (it has a hole through which water will enter if the Kli is put in water) is Motzi Mashkeh (if water is put inside, it will leave through the hole). However, a Kli can be Motzi Mashkeh without being Kones Mashkeh</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Any limb (extra finger) that has a nail has a bone, but a limb can have a bone without a nail;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Any Kli that is Mekabel Tum'as Medras (it becomes an Av ha'Tum'ah if a Zav or Nidah sits on it) is Mekabel Tum'as Mes (and all other Tum'os), but some Kelim are Mekabel Tum'as Mes but not Tum'as Medras.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> A Kli that is Kones Mashkeh is Pasul for Mei Chatas (one may not put ashes of Parah Adumah on water (drawn with, or) in such a Kli.) A shard that is Kones Mashkeh is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Kli that is Motzi Mashkeh is valid for Mei Chatas. Such a shard is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> A tradition from Moshe from Sinai teaches that the smallest Shi'ur (of a hole) that disqualifies an (intact) Kli Shares is Kones Mashkeh. The Shi'ur of Motzi Mashkeh pertains only to shards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason (that a hole that is Motzi Mashkeh is Metaher a shard)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Nachman):</span> People will not use a shard if they will need another shard to catch what drips from it! (Shards are used only to catch what drips from a Kli.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> How do we check if a Kli (which is Motzi Mashkeh) is Kones Mashkeh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We put the Kli in a bowl full of water. If water enters, it is Kones Mashkeh. If not, it is only Motzi Mashkeh. (Me'iri - every hole is Motzi Mashkeh.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> (Rashi - that test is no good, because one presses the Kli into the water. This forces water in even through a small hole! Me'iri - that test requires a big hole. A Kli is Kones Mashkeh even if water enters only (with the aid of gravity) from above!) Rather, we invert the Kli in an empty bowl, and fill the bowl with water above the level of the Kli. If water enters, it is Kones Mashkeh. If not, it is only Motzi Mashkeh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yehudah):</span> Alternatively, we see if fire is Ma'amid the Kli (water does not drip out when the Kli is over a fire). If fire is Ma'amid it, the Kli is only Motzi Mashkeh. If not, it is Kones Mashkeh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Yosi):</span> The fire test is no good. Fire is Ma'amid even a big hole! Rather, we see if burning coals and ashes are Ma'amid the Kli. If they are, the Kli is only Motzi Mashkeh. If not, it is Kones Mashkeh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5:</span> If water inside drips out drop after drop, surely it is Kones Mashkeh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the first two Tana'im?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> They argue about a Kli that is Kones Mashkeh if the water is pressed in.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AN EXTRA FINGER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any limb that has a nail...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A limb with a nail has (Tum'as) Maga, Masa and Ohel. (It is Metamei whatever touches it, moves it, or is above or below it or under a common roof with it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A limb with a bone but no nail has Maga and Masa, but not Ohel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda citing Rav):</span> If an extra finger has a bone but not a nail, it has Tum'as Maga and Masa, but not Ohel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This is only if it is not counted (i.e. in line) with the other fingers. (If it is, in any case it has Tum'as Ohel.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH <i>KELIM</i> RECEIVE <i>TUM'AS MEDRAS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any Kli that is Mekabel Tum'as Medras...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Any Kli that is Mekabel Tum'as Medras is Mekabel Tum'as Mes. Some Kelim are Mekabel Tum'as Mes but not Tum'as Medras;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Examples of the latter are a (box that holds a) Se'ah or half-Se'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "veha'Yoshev Al ha'Kli" includes a Zav who sat on a Se'ah or half-Se'ah, and it becomes Tamei (an Av ha'Tum'ah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher Yeshev Alav" discusses a Kli meant to be sat on, but not something that (if one sits on it,) people may tell him "get up! We need to use the Kli."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHO MAY JUDGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone Kosher to judge capital cases is Kosher to judge monetary cases. There is someone who is Kosher to judge monetary cases, but not capital cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> The latter clause discusses a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learned this from (Tosfos - what Rav Yehudah said about) a Mishnah in Sanhedrin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Everyone is Kosher to judge monetary cases, but not everyone is Kosher to judge capital cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is Kosher for monetary cases, but not for capital cases?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> This refers to a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, (Rav Yehudah said that) one Mishnah discusses a convert, and the other discusses a Mamzer. Both are needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text):</span> Had it taught only about a convert, we might have thought that he is Kosher for monetary cases, because he can marry a Bas Yisrael, but a Mamzer is disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only about a Mamzer, we might have thought that he may judge monetary cases because he was conceived by Yisraelim, but a convert would be disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Had it taught only about a convert, we might have thought that he is Pasul for capital cases, because he was not conceived by Yisraelim, but a Mamzer would be Kosher;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Had it taught only about a Mamzer, we might have thought that he is Pasul for capital cases because he cannot marry a Bas Yisrael, but a convert would be Kosher. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone Kosher to judge is Kosher to testify, but there is someone Kosher to testify who may not judge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is this (that he may testify, but may not judge)?</p>
