<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SOURCE OF THE 11 DAYS OF <i>ZIVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn (the 11 days of Zivah) from verses, not from a tradition!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one who sees three consecutive days at the beginning of Nidah becomes a Zavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The Torah mentions "Zavah" in two Parshiyos. Only the latter mentions "b'Lo Es Nidasah" and requires seven clean days and a Korban. The former really refers to Nidah.) If that is true (that one can become a Zavah during Nidah), how would we fulfill (the first Parshah) "Ishah Ki Siheyeh Zavah... " (which requires neither clean days nor a Korban)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That verse discusses one who saw only one day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "B'Lo Es Nidasah" teaches that she is a Zavah only if she saw shortly after (the seven days of) Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about one who saw right after Nidah (days 1, 2, 3 of Zivah). What is the source to include when a day intervened (she saw on days 2, 3, 4)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Oh Chi Sazov" includes this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include when two days intervened, or three, or four... , or ten?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like we find that day four can be a day of Sefirah (if she saw on day 1, 2, 3, day four is the first of the seven clean days) or a day of Zivah (if she saw on 2, 3, 4), also day 10 (or any prior day) can be a day of Sefirah (if she saw 1, 2, 3, day 10 is the seventh clean day) or a day of Zivah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that day 11 can be a day of Zivah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "B'Lo Es Nidasah" includes it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps even day 12 is included!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we include day 11, but not day 12?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We include 11, for it can be Sefirah for (Zivah that started on day two, which we learned from) "Oh Chi Sazov". We do not learn day 12, which cannot be Sefirah in this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about one who saw three consecutive days. What is the source for one who saw two consecutive days?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yemei (Zov)" includes this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">15.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for one who saw one day?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">16.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>Kol</i> Yemei" includes this;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Teme'ah" teaches that she is Metamei (for seven days) one who has Bi'ah with her, like a Nidah does;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"Hi" teaches that she is Metamei one who has Bi'ah with her, but a Zav is not Metamei (for seven days) one with whom he has Bi'ah. (Anyone he touches is a Rishon l'Tum'ah until they immerse, and a Tevul Yom from then until night.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">17.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that she is Metamei Mishkav u'Moshav?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">18.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "K'Mishkav Nidasah" teaches this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">19.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about one who saw three days. What is the source for one who saw two days?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">20.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yemei" includes this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">21.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for one who saw one day?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">22.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>Kol</i> Yemei" includes this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">23.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that she must count one day (refrain from Bi'ah) corresponding to a day she sees?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">24.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yihyeh Lah" teaches this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">25.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should obligate her to count seven clean days after seeing two consecutive days!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A man who saw Zov once need not count a day for this. (He may immerse immediately, and he is Tahor). If he sees two consecutive days, he needs seven clean days. A woman who saw blood once must count a corresponding day. All the more so if she sees two consecutive days she should need seven clean days!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yihyeh Lah" teaches that she counts only one day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">26.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question (a):</span> Verses teach the 11 days of Zivah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Akiva. He learns from verses. R. Elazar ben Azaryah has a tradition for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shemayah):</span> A woman should become a Zavah only if she sees during the day, but if she sees at night, she should become a Nidah! (In the Parshah of Zavah it says "Kol <i>Yemei</i> Zovah.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> This is why it says "<i>Al</i> Nidasah." Right after Nidasah, i.e. the beginning of night eight, the verse calls her a Zavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei Eliyahu):</span> One who learns (Me'iri - thoroughly enough to derive the) Halachos every day is a Ben Olam ha'Ba. We read "<i>Halichos</i> Olam Lo" like "<i>Halachos</i>, the world (to come) is for him." (Maharsha - now that Benos Yisrael are stringent like R. Zeira, the distinctions between Nidah and Zavah do not apply. Even so, these are still "Gufei Halachos," and one who learns them is a Ben Olam ha'Ba.)</p>
