<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE FIRST SIGHTING OF <i>ZOV</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> If a Metzora saw one sighting of Zov, is it Metamei b'Masa (one who moves it)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is Zov a Mayan (which has Tum'as Masa)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava - Beraisa):</span> "Zovo Tamei Hu" teaches that his Zov has Tum'as Masa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He is a normal Zav.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Zov causes him to have Tum'as Masa, all the more so it itself has Tum'as Masa! (We would not need a verse to teach this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, a Metzora became a Zav. (He was already Tamei, so the Kal va'Chomer does not apply.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Since a verse is needed to teach that the second sighting has Tum'as Masa, this shows that it is not a Mayan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Yehudah of Diskarta):</span> Perhaps he is a normal Zav. Some things are Tahor, yet they are Metamei others, e.g. the goat sent to Azazel. (It is Metamei the one who sends it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> (Why did Rava seek to learn from a Beraisa?) He should answer his question from his own teaching (at the end of 34b), "Zos Toras ha'Zav" -- whether he is a minor or an adult! (This is according to our text. Aruch la'Ner -- in Rashi's text, Rav Yosef himself expounded "Zos Toras ha'Zav," therefore Rashi explains that Abaye asks why Rav Yosef did not answer his own question from his teaching.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since we do not need "la'Zachar" to teach about a minor, it teaches Mayanos of a Metzora. "Vela'Nekevah" teaches about Mayanos of a Metzora'as!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah equates a Metzora with a Zav. Just like his Mayanos have Tum'as Masa, also the first sighting of Zov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The first sighting of Zov is Metamei even if it was b'Ones. "Zos Toras ha'Zav va'Asher Tetzei Mimenu Shichvas Zera," teaches that just like semen is Metamei b'Ones, also the first sighting of Zov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a man saw Zov, we check him (for seven possible causes -- overeating... )</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If there was a cause, he is Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, if there was a cause, it does not count towards three sightings to obligate a Korban (but he is Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If a man had a second sighting of Zov, we check him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we check?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We check regarding his obligation to bring a Korban, but in any case he is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (Zov is Metamei if it came by itself) "mi'Besaro," but not from an external cause.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, if there was a cause, he is not a Zav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Just like the Seifa discusses checking for Tum'ah, also the Reisha!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Reisha discusses checking for Korban, and the Seifa discusses checking for Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (the same Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> We check even on the third sighting, due to the Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The first Tana holds that we check due to Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, also the first Tana says that we check due to the Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about whether or not we expound "Es":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim do not expound "Es". They expound "veha'Zav (first sighting) Es Zovo (second sighting) la'Zachar vela'Nekevah" to teach that <i>after</i> two sightings, a Zav is equated to a Zavah (who is Teme'ah even b'Ones);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Eliezer expounds "Es". "Veha'Zav (first) Es (second) Zovo (third) la'Zachar vela'Nekevah" equates a Zav to a Zavah after three sightings. (Even sightings b'Ones are Mevatel clean days he may have.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Yitzchak):</span> We already knew that a Zav is like a Ba'al Keri (a man who had a seminal emission). The Torah wrote Zav separately to be more lenient and more stringent than a Ba'al Keri;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Zav is more lenient. His Tum'ah does not come through Ones;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Zav is more stringent. He is Metamei Mishkav and Moshav (to be an Av ha'Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">35b----------------------------------------35b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which sighting of Zov is discussed?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It discusses the second.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He is a full Zav (regarding Tum'ah). It would not say that he is like a Ba'al Keri!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it discusses the first, and it says that Tum'ah of Zov does not come through Ones!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It cannot refer to the first sighting. It says that he is Metamei a Mishkav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Beraisa means that we already knew that a man who saw Zov once is like a Ba'al Keri;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah wrote the law of Zov on the second sighting to be more lenient and more stringent than a Ba'al Keri. The Tum'ah does not come b'Ones, and he is Metamei a Mishkav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Zov is like water of a dough of barley. It comes without erection. Semen comes from an erection;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Zov is loose, like the white of a Muzeres egg (one that cannot produce a chick). Semen is sticky, like an egg yolk that is not Muzeres.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>DAM TOHAR</i> OF A WOMAN WHO DID NOT IMMERSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Dam Tohar of a Yoledes who did not immerse... (Beis Shamai is Metamei only if it is wet. Beis Hillel is Metamei even if it is dry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Hillel (to Beis Shamai)):</span> Don't you agree that if a Nidah did not immerse after seven days, her Dam is Tamei (mid'Oraisa, and hence even dry)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> Nidah is different. Even if she had immersed, her blood would be Tamei (it would be Dam Zivah or Nidah). If a Yoledes had immersed (after her Tum'ah), her Dam would be Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> We learn from Yoledes b'Zov. If she immersed after counting her clean days, her blood would be Tahor, but if she saw blood before immersing, it is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> We say that Yoledes b'Zov after counting her clean days is like a Yoledes after Yemei Tum'ah. Even without immersing, her blood is Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They argue about Yoledes b'Zov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> Beis Shamai agrees that blood of a Yoledes b'Zov is Tamei wet or dry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue when she counted her clean days. They agree when she did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a Yoledes b'Zov counted her clean days but did not immerse, Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argue like they do about a Yoledes.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SOURCE OF <i>DAM TOHAR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Dam Tohar comes from the same source as Dam Tamei (of a Yoledes, Nidah or Zavah). The Torah decreed that during Yemei Tohar it is Tahor, and at all other times it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Levi):</span> Dam Tohar comes from a different source. During Yemei Tohar, the source of Dam Tamei is closed, and the source of Dam Tohar is open.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about blood that flowed before and after the moment Yemei Tohar began (or ended. Surely, Levi attributes all the blood to one source, i.e. the one that was open until now):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav is lenient if this happened at the start of Yemei Tohar (all blood after it began is Tahor). He is stringent if this happened at the end of Yemei Tohar (all blood after it ended is Tamei);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Levi is stringent at the start of Yemei Tohar (as long as it flows, all the blood is from the Tamei source), and he is lenient at the end. (All the blood is Tahor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Levi - Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If a Yoledes did not immerse, her Dam Tohar is Tamei like her spit and urine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel say, it is Tamei wet or dry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> The case is, the blood has <i>not</i> been flowing continuously from the days of Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>According to Rav, we understand Beis Hillel. The Torah decreed that it is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>However, according to Levi, the blood is from the Tahor source. If she did not immerse, it should not be more Tamei than other Mayanos of a Teme'ah! (They are Teme'im only when wet.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the blood was flowing continuously from Yemei Tum'ah. It is from the Tamei source.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does Beis Shamai argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Levi admits that Beis Shamai holds like Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Levi, we understand the argument of Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rav, what do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Shamai says that Dam Tohar depends only on days (whether or not she immersed). Beis Hillel says that Dam Tohar depends on days and immersion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Levi - Mishnah):</span> Beis Shamai agrees that blood of a Yoledes b'Zov is Tamei wet or dry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> The blood was not flowing continuously from Yemei Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Rav, we understand this. The Torah decreed that it is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>However, according to Levi, the blood is from the Tahor source. It should not be Tamei when dry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, the blood was flowing continuously from Yemei Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is the Chidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is according to Beis Shamai;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai holds that there is one source for all the blood, the Torah decreed that during Yemei Tohar it is Tahor. However, we do not consider Yemei Tohar of Yoledes b'Zov to begin until she counts seven clean days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Devosah Titma" includes Bo'el Yoledes (he is like Bo'el Nidah), and the nights (we do not expound "<i>ki'Yemei</i> (like the days) Nidas" to exclude the nights), and Yoledes b'Zov, that she must count seven clean days (like a regular Zavah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rav, we understand why Yoledes b'Zov must count seven clean days. She has the law of a Zavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, according to Levi, even if she ceased to bleed for a moment (after the days of Tum'ah), even if she later sees blood, it is from the source of Dam Tohar, and the days should be considered clean!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that aYoledes b'Zov must cease to bleed for a moment in order that the next seven days will count as clean days.</p>
