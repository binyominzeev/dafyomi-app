<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>TUM'AH</i> DUE TO A <i>SHEFIR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a woman miscarried a Shefir full of flesh, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> I did not hear this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi:</span> My father said that if it is full of blood, she is a Nidah. If it is full of flesh, she is a Yoledes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Had you just told us the latter law, we would have accepted it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, the first law is not the majority opinion. It is like Sumchus (21b, it is unlike our Mishnah). Therefore we suspect that also the second law is like an individual, R. Yehoshua, and the Halachah does not follow him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> If a woman miscarried a Shefir that is not Merukam, it contains a child;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, there is no child.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish (and Rav Nachman below)):</span> They argue when it is cloudy (inside, perhaps a child dissolved), but if it is clear, all agree that there is no child.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> They argue when it is clear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he mean that they argue only when it is clear, but all agree when it is cloudy that it is a child?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or does he mean that they argue even when it is clear?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (against Reish Lakish - Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> "Va'Ya'as Hash-m Elokim l'Adam ul'Ishto Kasnos Or va'Yalbishem"-- Hash-m makes skin only for a formed person. (I.e. skin testifies that there is a child.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this if they argue when it is clear. R. Yehoshua needs a verse to be Metamei when it is clear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if they argue when it is cloudy, he is Metamei because there was a child. Why does he need a verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> They argue when it is clear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rava - Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> The following (miscarriages) testify to a child (to exempt the next birth from Bechorah):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tinuf (a dissolved fetus; alternatively, bubbles of blood) in a small animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Shilya in a large animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Shefir or Shilya in a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Observation:</span> The Tana omits Shefir in animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If they argue when it is clear, we understand this. The Torah teaches that skin (even if the inside is clear) testifies to a child in people, but not in animals;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they argue when it is cloudy, R. Yehoshua knows from reasoning that there is a child. The same should apply to animals!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions - Rav Nachman):</span> R. Yehoshua is unsure whether or not skin testifies to a child (when it is cloudy inside). He is stringent (about the next birth) in both directions;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding a firstborn son, this is a monetary question (whether or not Pidyon ha'Ben is required). We do not force the father to pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may not work with or shear a firstborn animal. We are stringent due to the Safek.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If a woman miscarried a Shefir,. we are stringent also about her Tum'ah. (She is a Safek Yoledes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehoshua learned from a verse (that skin testifies to a child)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mid'Rabanan, we are stringent as if skin testifies to a child. The verse is only an Asmachta.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chanina bar Salmiya (to Rav):</span> We have heard the opinions of Rebbi, R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi, R. Oshaya and R. Yehoshua ben Levi (regarding a Shefir full of flesh). Like whom do you hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Whether it is cloudy or clear, she is not concerned (lest there was a child);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> In either case, she is concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>This is consistent with the way Shmuel ruled in practice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> In Neharde'a (Shmuel's city), every woman who miscarried a Shefir was considered a Yoledes, except for one case that was so clear that a thread like a hair could be seen from the other side.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> If a child had dissolved, it would not be this clear.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A MERUKAM SHEFIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it was Merukam...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Sha'ul):</span> The initial formation of a Merukam Shefir is from the head (our text. Tosfos - the size of a grasshopper. It starts from the navel.) The eyes and nostrils are the size of eyes of a fly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chiya says, the eyes are far apart, and the nostrils are close together.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The mouth is a tiny crack, like a hair. The Ever is the size of a lentil. In a girl, (some texts - a crack) the length of a barley seed can be detected.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The legs and arms are not formed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Che'Chalav Taticheni vecha'Gevinah Takpi'eni Ohr u'Vasar Talbisheni uva'Atzamos v'Gidim Tesochecheni" (Hash-m forms man from fluid semen, congeals it, and puts on skin, flesh, bones and sinews).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We do not check the Shefir in water, for water is too hard. It can dissolve it;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we check it in oil, to make it clear. We look at it in the sun.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we check it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We just taught how to check it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, how do we determine the gender?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Aba Sha'ul bar Nash says, we use a chip of wood with a smooth end and move it where the genitals should be;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it gets caught on something, it is a boy. If not, it is a girl.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> We must move it vertically -- if we move it sideways, it could get caught on the walls of the Prozdor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah - Beraisa):</span> If it is a girl, there is a crack the size of a barley seed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> Perhaps the crack is the string holding the Beitzim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Beitzim themselves are too small to be detected, and all the more so the string holding them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Amram - Beraisa):</span> The thighs are like two threads of Zehoris (red wool). The arms are like two threads of Zehoris.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Amram):</span> The thighs are like warp threads (of Zehoris). The arms are like woof threads (which are thinner).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Shmuel (to Rav Yehudah):</span> Do not declare it a child unless it has hair (like a properly developed fetus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel said (regarding a Shefir full of blood) in either case she is concerned for a child!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ami bar Shmuel):</span> She is Safek Yoledes, lest there was a child. She does not get the leniency of Dam Tohar unless it has hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Shmuel is unsure whether or not it is a child.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel looked at a certain Shefir, and said that it was exactly 41 days from conception. He heard that she only immersed from Tum'as Nidah 40 days ago. He pressured her husband, who then admitted that he had Bi'ah with her before she immersed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel himself was an expert, so he could tell. Others are not so skilled, so he would tell them to be stringent.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A MISCARRIAGE OF A <i>SANDAL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman miscarried a Sandal (a mashed fetus) (she is a Yoledes for a male or female).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It is called Sandal because it resembles a fish of the same name. It was originally a proper fetus, and it became mashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, it resembles an ox tongue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They testified in the name of Chachamim that it is considered a child only if the face is recognizable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows these Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada):</span> It is considered a child if (and only if) a face is recognizable, even if it is on the back;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven slaps Shimon's face, he causes the face to turn. Likewise, something (e.g. another fetus) turned the Sandal's face around!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>In the days of R. Yanai, Rabanan wanted to be Metaher (a woman who miscarried) a Sandal without a recognizable face.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Yanai:</span> She is a Yoledes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> They testified in the name of Chachamim that it is considered a child only if the face is recognizable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Bivi bar Abaye, citing R. Yochanan):</span> R. Nechunya gave this testimony/ (The majority argue with him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Also I heard this from R. Yochanan. Rav Bivi merited that it be said in his name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make whether or not a Sandal is a child? It is born only with another child (which mashed it). She is a Yoledes due to the child!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, if it was born with a girl, it makes no difference. (The mother has Tum'ah and Taharah of Yoledes Nekevah whether or not she also gave birth to a boy);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It makes a difference if it was born with a boy. (Because perhaps the Sandal was a girl, the mother is Safek Yoledes Zachar, Safek Yoledes Nekevah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One might have thought that we assume that both fetuses were the same gender due to R. Yitzchak bar Ami's teaching;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Ami):</span> If the man was Mazri'a (emits his seed) before the woman (and she became pregnant from this), the child will be a girl. If she is Mazra'as before him, the child will be a boy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. Perhaps both were Mazri'a at the same time, so the children can be either gender.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Even if it was born with a girl, it can make a difference, e.g. the girl was born before nightfall and the Sandal was born after nightfall. (The stringencies of Tum'as Yoledes Nekevah apply from the night, i.e. the next day.)</p>
