<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO MAY JUDGE BUT MAY NOT TESTIFY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It refers to someone who is blind in one eye. Our Mishnah is R. Meir:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir) Question:</span> "V'Al Pihem Yihyeh Kol Riv v'Chol Naga" -- what is the connection between Riv (Dinim, i.e. monetary cases) and Nega'im (Tzara'as? Rashash - granted, only Kohanim can judge Tzara'as, but why should Kohanim be required for monetary cases?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah equates them. Just like the Kohen looks at Tzara'as only during the day ("uv'Yom Hera'os"), also Dinim must be judged during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Also, just like a Kohen who is blind (even in one eye) cannot rule about Tzara'as (for it says "l'Chol Mar'ei Einei ha'Kohen"), a blind person cannot judge Dinim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We also learn from Dinim to Tzara'as. Just like relatives cannot judge Dinim, they cannot rule about Tzara'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like we require three judges for Dinim, we should require three Kohanim to rule about Tzara'as!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> If three judges are required to take money from a person, all the more so three are required to declare Tzara'as on his body!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Huva El Aharon ha'Kohen Oh El Echad" teaches that even one Kohen can rule.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A blind man used to judge in R. Yochanan's neighborhood. R. Yochanan did not say anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan said that the Halachah follows a Stam (anonymous) Mishnah, and he himself said that our Stam Mishnah, which says that there is someone Kosher to testify but not to judge, refers to someone blind in one eye! (All the more so, a totally blind person may not judge.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan rules like a different Stam Mishnah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Monetary cases must be started during the day, one may finish them at night. (Rulings about Tzara'as, which are like a final verdict, must be during the day. This shows that the Tana does not equate Dinim to Tzara'as. Rashi (Sanhedrin) - at night, everyone is like a blind person, yet we may finish Dinim at night.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he rule like that Stam Mishnah, and not like ours?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That Mishnah is the opinion of many Chachamim. (We do not attribute it to an individual. Our Mishnah is like R. Meir.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> That Mishnah teaches the law among other Dinim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TO WHAT DO <i>MA'ASER</i> AND <i>PE'AH</i> APPLY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Tum'as Ochlim applies to everything from which (Terumos and) Ma'aseros must be taken, but there are things that have Tum'as Ochlim, but are exempt from Ma'aseros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What has Tum'as Ochlim, but it is exempt from Ma'aseros?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Meat, fish and eggs are examples.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ma'aseros must be taken from everything from which Pe'ah (a corner of the field) must be left (for the poor), but there are things liable to Ma'aser which are exempt from Pe'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is liable regarding Ma'aseros but is exempt from Pe'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> Pe'ah must be left from any food with the following properties:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>People guard it, it grows from the ground, it is harvested at once, it may be stored for a long time</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says "food" to exclude Sefichim (things that grew by themselves, e.g. from seeds that fell) of safflower or woad (a dye);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"People guard it" excludes Hefker. "It grows from the ground" excludes truffles and mushrooms. "It is harvested at once" excludes figs. "It may be stored for a long time" excludes vegetables.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ma'aser must be taken from any food that grows from the ground and people guard it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We do not require that it is harvested at once, or that it may be stored for a long time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Pe'ah applies to garlic and onions (for they are stored for a long time);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there are rows of onions between patches of vegetables, (the vegetables are an interruption, so) Pe'ah must be left for each row;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, one Pe'ah suffices for all the rows.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>INTENT FOR <i>TUM'AS OCHLIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one planted endives for the sake of animals, then decided that they should be for people, they are not Mekabel Tum'ah until one has intent (that people will eat them) after they are detached.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">50b----------------------------------------50b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He holds that intent while they are attached has no effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava - Mishnah):</span> There are 13 laws of Nivlas Ohf Tahor. One is that it requires intent (to eat it, to join with other food to comprise a Shi'ur for Tum'as Ochlim), but it does not require Hechsher (through a liquid to be Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim. Rashi - also, it is Tamei by itself. It need not touch Tum'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Surely, while a Tahor bird was alive one intended to eat it. The intent required is after it died, because) intent mi'Chayim (while it is alive) has no effect. Likewise, intent while something is attached has no effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Zeira):</span> No, the case is the bird fell from above. There was no intent to eat it mi'Chayim. (However, intent mi'Chayim would have sufficed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> There was a case in Yavneh (later on this Daf), in which Chachamim required intent for a chicken. (Surely, it did not fall from the sky!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> It was a Tarnegol Bara (a wild chicken. No one had intent mi'Chayim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>People laughed at this. (The case in Yavneh involved Tum'as Beis ha'Bliyah (due to eating).) It could not be Tarnegol Bara, which is a Tamei bird!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> When a great Chacham speaks, do not laugh! He means that a hen ran away (and had chicks. No one had intent for them mi'Chayim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He calls it Bara for it is Ivrai (away) from its owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> It was a Tarnegolta d'Agma ("hen of the swamp," a wild species).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This is like Rav Papa taught elsewhere;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Tarnegol (rooster) d'Agma is forbidden. (It is a Tamei species.) Tarnegolta d'Agma is permitted. (It is a Tahor species.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mereimar):</span> (Any bird that is Dores (catches its prey in its claws, or holds its food in its claws while eating, or eats its prey before it dies) is Tamei.) Chachamim subsequently saw Tarnegolta d'Agma be Dores, so they forbade it. It is the species Girusa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a chick fell into a vat of wine (and died) and one intended to remove it and feed it to a Nochri, it is Tamei (has Tum'as Ochlim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he intended to feed it to a dog, it is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan ben Nuri says, even in this case it is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Nuri:</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that it is Tamei. It has severe Tum'ah (Beis ha'Bliyah) without intent. All the more so, it has mild Tum'ah (Ochlim) without intent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> You cannot learn from severe Tum'ah, for it is not Yoredes l'Kach (this will be explained), but it is Yored for mild Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Nuri:</span> There was a case in Yavneh of a hen. It is Yoredes l'Kach, yet Chachamim were Metamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The case was, there was intent to feed it to Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what case do they argue? (Me'iri - was the case truly in Yavneh (a big city), or in a nearby village?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is in a big city, no one should require intent!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following do not require intent (because some people eat them) nor Hechsher -- Nivlas Behemah Tehorah in any place, or Nivlas Ohf Tahor and Chelev in big cities.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about a village.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> All agree that intent is needed there!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following require intent but not Hechsher -- Nivlas Behemah Teme'ah in any place, and Nivlas Ohf Tahor and Chelev in villages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ze'ira bar Chanina):</span> Really, they argue about a big city. A chick that falls into wine gets spoiled, so it is (not assumed that anyone will eat it,) like in a village.</p>
