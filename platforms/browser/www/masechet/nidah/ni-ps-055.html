<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH PARTS OF A <i>MES</i> ARE <i>TEME'IM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Flesh of a Mes...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> "L'Chol Tum'aso" teaches that any Tum'ah that separates from a Mes is Metamei (whether it is wet or dry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> "Oh b'Etzem Adam" equates a man to a bone:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a bone is Tamei, even though it is dry, also (flesh of) a man is Tamei, even though it is dry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about flesh that is so dry that it crumbles. (R. Yochanan is not Metamei anything dryer than bones. Reish Lakish does not distinguish.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> If flesh of a Mes crumbled, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it was ground like flour. (It is not considered flesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Every part of a Mes is Tamei, except for the teeth, hair and fingernails. When they are connected, even these are Tamei. (Rashi - teeth should be like bones. We ask against both of them. Tosfos - we ask only against Reish Lakish. R. Yochanan's Hekesh teaches only about flesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> A part of a Mes is Tamei only if it is like a bone, i.e. it was there from birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, hair and fingernails should be Teme'im. They were there from birth!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> Rather, a part of a Mes is Tamei only if it is like a bone, i.e. it was there from birth and does not regenerate (if it is removed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This excludes teeth, which were not there from birth. It excludes hair and fingernails. Even though they were there from birth, they regenerate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> Skin regenerates, yet it is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Geludah (an animal without skin) is Kosher;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, it is Terefah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim agree that skin regenerates. They say that Geludah is Terefah only because the animal will die due to wind before it regenerates.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following skins are (Tamei) like the flesh -- that of man...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ula taught that mid'Oraisa, human skin is Tahor. Chachamim decreed that is Tamei, lest people make saddles from their parents' skin. (Ramban (Chulin) - perhaps they will make mats and keep them for the sake of eulogies. Later, one who does not know that they are from human skin might use them for saddles.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> Skin does not regenerate, yet it is Tahor (mid'Oraisa)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> Geludah is Terefah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even R. Meir agrees that skin does not regenerate. He is Machshir because he holds that the flesh under the skin becomes hard like skin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Mid'Oraisa, human skin is Tahor. Chachamim decreed that is Tamei, lest people make saddles from their parents' skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ula refers to the Seifa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If any skin was tanned or trampled enough for tanning, it is Tahor, except for human skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Mid'Oraisa, tanned human skin is Tahor. Chachamim decreed that it is Tamei, lest people make mats from their parents' skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Flesh regenerates, yet it is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> When flesh grows back, the area remains scarred. (It is unlike hair and fingernails. They regenerate without leaving evidence that they were removed.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>TUM'AH</i> OF <i>ZOV</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Zov (is Metamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source (that it is Tamei? Later (56a) we derive that this is only if it is moist.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Zovo Tamei" teaches that Zov is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach this. It is Metamei others (the man it came from). All the more so it itself is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach (the goat sent to Azazel on Yom Kipur) disproves this. It is Metamei the man who sends it, while it itself is Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Therefore, "Zovo Tamei" is needed to teach that Zov is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the verse teaches only about Tum'as Maga, but not Masa, just like a Sheretz has only Tum'as Maga!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> There is no need to teach that Zov has Tum'as Maga. It is no less Tamei than semen. The verse is needed only for Masa.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">55b----------------------------------------55b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is Metamei Begadim (people and their garments) through Masa, but it is Metamei only people through Maga, just like a Nevelah is not Metamei garments of one who touches it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - Others):</span> "Veha'Zav Es Zovo la'Zachar vela'Nekevah" equates Zov to the Zav:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like we do not distinguish Tum'os Maga and Masa of a Zav (both are Metamei Begadim), we do not distinguish these Tum'os of Zov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since "veha'Zav Es Zovo" teaches that Zov is Metamei Begadim through Maga and Masa, why do we need "Zovo Tamei"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah of Diskarta):</span> "Zovo Tamei" is needed to overturn the disproof from Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach. It is Metamei, but it itself is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could we think that Zov is Tahor? If it were Tahor, what would we learn from "veha'Zav Es Zovo"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This would teaches about the number of sightings:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Veha'Zav" connotes one sighting. "Zovo" connotes a second sighting. After three sightings, Zachar and Nekevah are equated. (A Zav brings a Korban even if his third sighting was b'Ones, just like a Zavah brings a Korban even if (all) her sightings were b'Ones.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SALIVA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Spit (is Metamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "v'Chi Yarok" teaches that (if a Zav spits at Ploni,) Ploni becomes Tamei even if the spit does not touch him! (This will be explained.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ba'Tahor" teaches that he becomes Tamei only if it reaches him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about spit. What is the source to include Kicho, Ni'o and Mei ha'Af (kinds of spit, mucus or phlegm of a Zav)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>V</i>'Chi Yarok" includes them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa suggested that Ploni becomes Tamei even if the spit does not touch him. Why would we think so?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought to learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Rok-Rok" from Yevamah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Yevamah's spit need not touch the Yavam. One might have thought that here also, it need not touch him. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps his spit has Tum'ah Maga, but not Tum'as Masa, just like a Sheretz!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Reish Lakish, citing Tana d'vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Ba'Tahor" -- when he spits on something that the Tahor is holding, this is Metamei the Tahor (i.e. due to Masa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is Metamei Begadim through Masa, but it is Metamei people alone through Maga, just like a Nevelah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Reish Lakish, and Tana d'vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Ba'Tahor" -- what is Tahor regarding another Tum'ah, is Tamei regarding spit of a Zav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The other Tum'ah is Maga Nevelah. (One who touches a Nevelah is not Metamei Begadim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the other Tum'ah is Masa Sheretz! (It is totally Tahor. We would infer only that spit has Tum'as Masa, but not Tum'as Begadim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said "ba'Adam," we would have know that there is Tum'as Masa. Rather, it says "ba'Tahor" to teach another law as well (Tum'as Begadim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Mei ha'Af is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is (the case of) Mei ha'Af (mucus)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It comes out of the mouth. (It was sucked from the nasal passage);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is Tamei because inevitably there are drops of spit inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is Tamei even if it comes out of the nose.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that it is a Mayan. The Torah is Metamei Mayanos (of a Zav, Nidah... ).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav, the Tana should also teach that tears are Tamei (if he sucked them and spit them out. Rav holds that this is possible!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One who lets a Nochri paint his eyes endangers his sight.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Levi):</span> He endangers his life!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Gurya):</span> Rav does not say that he endangers his life, for even if the Nochri will poison the eyes, the victim can suck the poison through his mouth and spit it out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav holds that even though one can suck the poison through his mouth, but he cannot suck tears.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> There are nine Mashkim of Zavim (and Zavos):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sweat, pus and excrement are totally Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Tears, blood of a wound and milk have Tum'as Mashkim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Any amount of spit, Zivah and urine are Avos ha'Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Tana omits Mei ha'Af!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Granted, according to Rav, he omits it because the law is not uniform. If it comes out from the mouth it is Tamei, but if it comes out from the nose, it is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, according to R. Yochanan, he should have taught it! (It is always Tamei.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Why did the Tana omit Kicho and Ni'o?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that he taught spit, and this includes everything learned from the Ribuy ("<i>v</i>'Chi Yarok").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Likewise, Mei ha'Af is learned from the Ribuy!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>We learn tears from "va'Tashkemo bi'Dema'os Shalish";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn blood of a wound from "v'Dam Chalalim Yishteh." It makes no difference (regarding Mayanos) whether or not the person died from the wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn milk from "va'Tiftach Es Nod he'Chalav va'Tashkeho."</p>
