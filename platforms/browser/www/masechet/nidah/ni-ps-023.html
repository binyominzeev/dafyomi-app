<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FROM WHICH <i>GEZEIRAH SHAVAH</i> DO WE LEARN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make if one or both sides (words) of a Gezeirah Shavah are extra?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that if neither side of a Gezeirah Shavah is extra, we do not learn from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one side is extra, we learn from the Gezeirah Shavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim say, if we have a reason not to learn, we do not. (We do not learn a stringency of a stringent case to a lenient case);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yishmael says, we do not challenge the Gezeirah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If both sides are extra, all agree that we learn from it, and we do not challenge it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yishmael, what is the difference whether one or both sides are extra?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If we have a choice of which Gezeirah Shavah to learn from (there are two), and only one of them is extra from both sides, we learn from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>This is why the Torah wrote "va'Ya'as... ," so Yetzirah would be extra also regarding animals!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav Acha brei d'Rava is more lenient. He says that in any case, we may learn from a Gezeirah Shavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If neither side is extra, we may challenge it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one side is extra, Chachamim say that we may challenge it, and R. Yishmael says that we do not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If both sides are extra, all agree that we do not challenge it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Chachamim, what is the difference whether neither or one side is extra?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If we have a choice of which Gezeirah Shavah to learn from (against which there is no challenge), and one is not extra from either side, and the other is extra from one side, we learn from the latter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The Torah made "Yetzirah- Yetzirah" extra from both sides. If it were extra from only one side,) how could we have challenged the Gezeirah Shavah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Man is Mekabel Tum'ah while he is alive, but animals are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> R. Meir learns a Gezeirah Shavah "Yetzirah-Yetzirah." (This is like Rav Yehudah explained.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Ami):</span> If so, if a woman miscarried the form of a mountain, she should be a Yoledes. It says "Hinei Yotzer Harim u'Vorei Ru'ach"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> A miscarriage is small. It does not resemble a mountain, rather, a rock.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Ami):</span> If a woman miscarried Ru'ach (nothing came out), she should be a Yoledes, for it says "u'Vorei Ru'ach"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We do not learn from this, because "u'Vorei" is not extra.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is extra. It could have said "Yotzer Harim v'Ru'ach"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> We learn a Gezeirah Shavah between verses of Chumash, but not from a verse of Chumash to a verse of Nevi'im or Kesuvim (Tosfos ha'Rosh - unless we cannot learn between verses of Chumash).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ANOTHER EXPLANATION OF R. MEIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> R. Meir learns animals from people because animal eyes resemble human eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If so, if a woman miscarried a snake, she should be a Yoledes. (The sockets of) snake eyes are round, like human eyes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that is the law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Mishnah should have taught regarding snakes, all the more so we would know regarding animals!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it did not, lest we think that Chachamim argue only about snakes, but they admit about animals, for they learn also "Yetzirah-Yetzirah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Mishnah):</span> If animal eyes resemble human eyes, this is a blemish. (Normally, they are different!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The black (pupil) of animal eyes is normally round, like human eyes. The socket is normally different than a human eye socket. If it is similar, this is a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> R. Meir learns animals from people because their eyes face forward, like human eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The eyes of birds face to the side, yet R. Meir is Metamei (Tum'as Yoledes) one who miscarries the form of a bird!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He is only Metamei only one who gave birth to an owl (or another similar species), for its eyes face forward.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He is Metamei for other birds!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chanina ben Gamliel):</span> I agree with R. Meir regarding animals, and with Chachamim regarding birds.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which birds does he refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He refers to owls.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Presumably, he agrees with R. Meir regarding animals because their eyes face forward. For the same reason, he should agree regarding owls!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He agrees with Chachamim regarding other birds.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Meir argues regarding other birds!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chanina means 'I agree with R. Meir regarding animals, and also regarding owls. I agree with Chachamim regarding other birds, for even R. Meir does not argue about other birds.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok):</span> R. Meir considers a miscarried animal like a child. Chachamim do not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A miscarriage of a bird must be checked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to which Tana must it be checked?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Meir requires checking to see if it is an owl. (He agrees that any other bird is not a child.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2):</span> No, Chachamim require checking to see if it is an owl. (Only this is considered a child.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim consider an owl to be a child more than an animal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Its jaws are erect, like human jaws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah of R. Zeira):</span> According to R. Meir, who says that an animal born to a woman is a proper child, if a father was Mekadesh such a daughter to a man, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> What difference does it make whether or not the Kidushin takes effect? (Tosfos - surely, she will not live to three years, the age for Bi'ah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If she is Mekudeshes, her husband is forbidden to her sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that she can live! (Rashi - when a woman dies, her sister is permitted to her husband. Tosfei ha'Rosh - if she were considered a Nefel, Kidushin would not take effect.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Zeira):</span> Rav Yehudah taught that R. Meir considers an animal (born to a woman) to be a child only because others of its species live.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The species lives, but the animal itself cannot live!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Explanation (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> R. Yirmeyah was merely trying to get R. Zeira to laugh. He failed. (Aruch la'Ner - the Zohar permits Sechok in learning Torah -- "Ivdu Es Hash-m b'Simchah"! Shabbos 30b says that the Rebbi should begin with a joke, but afterwards the learning is with trepidation.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Meir considers an animal to be a child because others of its species live. (We inferred that the animal itself cannot live.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Acha mi'Difti - Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a woman's first birth had the form of an animal or bird, her <i>next</i> birth (if he is a boy) is a firstborn regarding inheritance. (He gets a double portion.) He is not a firstborn regarding Pidyon ha'Ben (the Mitzvah to redeem him through giving five Shekalim to a Kohen);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, only a human form exempts the next child from Pidyon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a woman miscarried a Shilya or Shefir Merukam (it has a human form inside) or a cut-up baby, her next birth is a firstborn regarding inheritance, but not regarding Pidyon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of support:</span> If an animal could live, the next child would not be a firstborn regarding inheritance!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Really, it can live. Regarding inheritance it says "Reishis <i>Ono</i>." This refers to the first child whose death would cause the father to be Mis'onen (mourn);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He would not grieve the loss of an animal.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED HUMAN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> According to R. Meir, who says that an animal in a woman is a proper child, what is the law of a human form in the womb of a slaughtered animal?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it is considered an animal, one may eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan taught that if the form of a dove is found in the womb of a slaughtered animal, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same should apply to a human form!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (The Torah permits "<i>Kol</i> Mafreses Parsah... <i>ba'Behemah</i>," we include a fetus inside a slaughtered animal, even if its Parsos (hooves) are not split.) Bird feet are not considered Parsos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps human feet are considered like unsplit hooves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> Anything without (a human form is not a child).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah bar Aba citing Rav):</span> All agree that if the body resembles a goat and the face is human, it is human. If it has a human body and a goat's face, it is not a child;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue when it has a human face, but one eye is like an animal's eye. R. Meir says that even the partial form of a human (is considered a child). Chachamim require the entire form (of the face) to be human.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Tosfos - Question (Rabanan - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The entire face must be human;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It means that even if one Partzuf is <i>not</i> human (except for the ear) it is not a child. This is like the opinion that the entire face must be human.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It means, even if one Partzuf of each pair (e.g. eyes or jaws) is human, except for the ear, it is a child. This is like the opinion that part (Rashi - half) must be human.</p>
