<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN <i>SEMEN</i> IS <i>METAMEI</i> A WOMAN (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, also Rava discusses a woman who was carried to the Mikveh on her bed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> The Beraisa discusses a woman who did not sit up. Rava discusses a woman who sat up.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> The Beraisa discusses a woman who was still during Bi'ah. (All the semen is absorbed together, so it is all discharged together.) Rava discusses a woman who turned over during Bi'ah. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rava explains the verse (which implies that she has only Tum'as Erev);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The verse discusses a woman who lied still. If she sat up (or turned over during Bi'ah), she may not eat Terumah for three days, for surely semen will be discharged.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shmuel bar Bisna):</span> If semen exudes from a woman, is she Teme'ah k'Ro'eh (like one who saw blood), or only k'Noga'as (like one who touched Tum'ah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she is k'Ro'eh, (then if she was counting seven clean days after Zivah,) it is Soser (all the days she counted). Any amount of semen is Metamei her, and she becomes Teme'ah before it leaves her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she is k'Noga'as, it is not Soser, she is Teme'ah only if a Shi'ur (k'Adashah (the size of a lentil) or the opening of the Ever) exuded, and she is not Teme'ah until it leaves her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rav Shmuel ask?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he heard the Beraisa (Chachamim are Metamei before it leaves her, and R. Shimon is not Metamei until it leaves her), he would know that Chachamim consider her k'Ro'eh, and R. Shimon considers her k'Noga'as!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he did not hear the Beraisa, surely he should assume that she is k'Noga'as! (The Tum'ah came to her from the outside.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Really, he heard the Beraisa. He knew that Chachamim considered her k'Ro'eh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He was unsure according to R. Shimon. Perhaps R. Shimon says that her law is not more stringent than her husband regarding Tum'as Beis ha'Starim (she is Tehorah until it comes out), but it is Soser, and any amount is Metamei her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps she is k'Noga'as in all respects.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He did not hear the Beraisa. He was unsure whether or not we learn from the giving of the Torah. (Yisrael had to refrain from Bi'ah three days in advance, lest a woman emit semen. There was no Isur to touch Tum'ah. This suggests that emitting semen is unlike Noge'a);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, perhaps we do not learn from the giving of the Torah, for Hash-m did not command about Zavim and Metzora'im, even though their Tum'ah is more stringent than one who emits semen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye, Rava, and Rav Yosef):</span> She is k'Ro'eh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Shmuel was unhappy with the answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Defense (Abaye, for himself):</span> R. Shimon says that her law is not more stringent than her husband only regarding Tum'as Beis ha'Starim. However, it is Soser, and any amount is Metamei her. (R. Shimon himself requires a Shi'ur of semen to leave a man to be Metamei him. Rav Shmuel and Abaye hold like the opinion that any amount is Metamei him.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BLOOD IS <i>METAMEI</i> INTERNALLY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All of the following become Tamei internally, just like externally -- a Nidah, Zavah, Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom and Yoledes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush of Yoledes? If she sees blood during the days of Nidah, she is like a Nidah; if she sees blood during Yemei Zivah, she is like a Zavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, she saw after the seven (or 14) days of Tum'ah, before immersing, like R. Zeira's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> If a Yoledes went to immerse (after Yemei Tum'ah), and blood left the Makor (and entered Beis ha'Chitzon) before she immersed, even after immersing she is Teme'ah (regarding Taharos. Since the blood left while she was still Teme'ah, it has Tum'as Masa and she carries it inside her. She is permitted to her husband);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If blood left the Makor after she immersed, she is Tehorah. (Tahor Dam (Tohar) is inside her).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Why is she Teme'ah in the first case? The Tum'ah is Belu'ah (engulfed inside her)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avin):</span> Chachamim decreed that she is Teme'ah. (We are concerned lest she think that she will be Tehorah even after the blood comes out, for the immersion was Metaher it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We find a precedent for such a decree. One who eats Nevelah of a Tahor bird is Metamei (himself and his) Begadim, even though the Nevelah is Belu'ah!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yirmeyah):</span> That is different. Nivlas Ohf Tahor is Metamei only when it is swallowed, but blood is Tamei outside!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The blood is Metamei only when it leaves her.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the blood left, what is the Chidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that just like the immersion is Metaher blood inside (the Makor, blood that leaves afterwards is Dam Tohar), it is Metaher also blood outside (in Beis ha'Chitzon). R. Zeira teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This answers for R. Zeira, but the Beraisa is still difficult! The Beraisa does not say that she is Tehorah until the blood leaves. It says that a Yoledes is Teme'ah internally like externally!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The case is, she gave birth without blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what internal and external Tum'ah is there?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tum'as Yoledes begins once the baby's head leaves the Prozdor. This is (considered birth,) as R. Oshaya taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> (If a midwife touched a dead fetus inside the womb, even though it is Belu'ah, she is Teme'ah.) This is a decree, lest the fetus' head came out of the Prozdor (and she did not know this).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The following episode teaches the same principle.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">A man:</span> Is circumcision permitted on Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Yes. (Rava later suspected that the question was not so simple.) What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">The man:</span> My son was born on Shabbos, but I heard him cry (earlier in the delivery) on Erev Shabbos. What is considered the day of birth?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> If you heard him cry, his head already left the Prozdor, so he was born on Erev Shabbos. You may not circumcise him on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TUM'AH BELU'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is (Tum'ah in) the Beis ha'Chitzon considered Belu'ah, or just Tum'as Beis ha'Starim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Rachel stuck a piece of Nevelah in the Beis ha'Chitzon of Leah:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is Belu'ah, it is not Metamei at all. (In any case, Rachel is Teme'ah for moving it <i>before</i> inserting it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it is Beis ha'Starim, it is Metamei Leah through Masa. (She moves it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It is Belu'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It is Beis ha'Starim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava, for himself - Beraisa):</span> If not for the verse (that is Metamei a woman who has Bi'ah), the semen would not be Metamei her, for it is Tum'as Beis ha'Starim. The Torah decreed that she is Teme'ah anyway.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> It means that if not for the verse, the semen would not be Metamei her, for it is Belu'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if you would say that it is not Belu'ah, but rather Beis ha'Starim, it would not be Metamei her (if not for the verse).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the Beis ha'Bli'ah (the place where one swallows) considered Belu'ah, or just Beis ha'Starim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Reuven stuck a piece of Nevelah down Shimon's throat:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is Belu'ah, it is not Metamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it is Beis ha'Starim, it is Metamei (Shimon) through Masa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It is Belu'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It is Beis ha'Starim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Support (Abaye, for himself - Beraisa) Suggestion: Perhaps one who eats Nevelah of a Behemah is Metamei Begadim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Nevelah u'Terefah Lo Yochal l'Tam'ah Vah" teaches that the Tum'ah (of eating) applies only to something that is not Metamei someone until they eat it, but not to Nivlas Behemah, which is Metamei a person (through Maga or Masa) without eating it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that it is Metamei Begadim! Nivlas Ohf Tahor has no external Tum'ah, only internal Tum'ah (one who eats it is Metamei Begadim). Nivlas Behemah has external Tum'ah (Maga and Masa), all the more so it should have internal Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Vah" teaches that Tum'ah of eating applies (only) to Nivlas Ohf Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Nivlas Behemah, it says "veha'Ochel"! (One who eats it is Metamei Begadim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches that the Shi'ur for Tum'as Maga and Masa is the same as the Shi'ur to be liable for eating it, i.e. a k'Zayis.</p>
