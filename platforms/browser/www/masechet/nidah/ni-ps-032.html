<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WE ARE CONCERNED FOR THE MINORITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is our Tana, who is concerned for the minority?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Meir:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A (minor) boy or girl may not do Yibum or Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We agree that a minor may not Choletz. It says "Ish," and the Torah equates the Yevamah to the Yavam;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, why do you forbid Yibum?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> (Perhaps Yibum does not apply because the minor will never have normal sexual development.) A boy might be a Seris, and a girl might be an Ailonis. (If so, Yibum is not a Mitzvah, so they transgress the Ervah of marrying a sister-in-law!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim are not concerned for this. They follow the majority. (Most people are normal.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This shows that R. Meir is concerned for a common minority. What is the source that he is concerned for an uncommon minority (girls that see blood before maturity)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The minority of girls that see blood at an early age is common;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi, Rebbi and Rav Yosef testified about (different) cases in Ein Bul, Beis She'arim and Pumbedisa in which a girl became a Nidah (within a week of birth) and was immersed before her mother immersed (after two weeks).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first two cases were in Eretz Yisrael. We understand why they immersed her, lest she touch Terumah (and be Metamei it. Rashba - they did not want her to be Metamei those who touch her.) However, why did they immerse the girl in Bavel?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Terumah of Chutz la'Aretz is forbidden only to someone from whom Tum'ah emanates (a Zav, Zavah, Nidah or Metzora);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even such a person does not disqualify Terumah of Chutz la'Aretz! (Rashba deletes this from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra):</span> They immersed her in order to anoint her with Terumah oil. (She was a Bas Kohen);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Lo Yechalelu... Asher Yarimu" includes anointing and drinking Terumah. (These are forbidden to a Tamei Kohen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must a verse forbid drinking? This is included in the prohibition to eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa means that the verse includes anointing, for it is like drinking.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn that anointing is like drinking from "va'Tavo cha'Mayim b'Kirbo vecha'Shemen b'Atzmosav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should decree Tum'ah also on our girls (regular Benos Yisrael). Perhaps they are Nidos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We expound "Ishah... v'Ishah." (This will be explained.) when we see that a girl saw blood, we do not let her touch Taharos until she immerses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kusim do not expound this. They think that a minor cannot become Nidah. Even if she saw blood they would ignore it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MINORS CAN BECOME <i>TEME'IM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we expound "Ishah... v'Ishah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Ishah (who will become a Nidah)" applies only to an adult!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "<i>V</i>'Ishah" teaches that even a one-day-old girl (can become Nidah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Observation:</span> When the Torah includes (minor) girls, it includes even a one-day-old.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Ishah (who has Bi'ah becomes Teme'ah)" applies only to an adult!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "<i>V</i>'Ishah" includes even a three year old girl. Bi'ah with her is considered Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Rava):</span> One of these is a tradition from Moshe from Sinai. The verse is only an Asmachta.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which is truly expounded, which is a tradition?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The law of Nidah is a tradition, and the law of Bi'ah is expounded.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The verse does not mention three years. This must be a tradition!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Nidah is expounded, and Bi'ah is a tradition.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Bi'ah is a tradition, what do we learn from "<i>v</i>'Ishah" written regarding Bi'ah?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Since we do not need it to teach about Bi'ah,) it excludes a man who has red emissions. (He is Tahor);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Ishah (who sees during Yemei Zivah can become a Zavah)" applies only to an adult!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "<i>V</i>'Ishah" includes even a ten-day-old girl. (If she became a Nidah on the day she was born, she can become a Zavah on day ten.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need another verse to teach this? We should learn from Nidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that a minor can become a Nidah, for Nidah is stringent. One sighting is Metamei her for seven days, but Zivah is lenient; one sighting of Zivah is Metamei her for only one day. Perhaps Zivah applies only to adults!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Torah teaches that a minor can become a Zavah, she must have been a Nidah at least nine days earlier. We do not need another verse to teach about Nidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, that is true. The verse regarding Nidah is Metaher a man who has red emissions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learned this from "<i>v</i>'Ishah" written regarding Bi'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is Metaher emissions of blood, and the other is Metaher red semen.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BOYS CAN BECOME <i>TEME'IM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Similarly, a boy can become Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Ish Ish" includes even a one day old boy. (If he has three emissions of Zivah, he becomes a Zav);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah says, we have a different source -- "(these are the laws of Zivah) la'Zachar ul'Nekevah" discusses a male or female of any age.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Ish Ish"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah speaks like people do. (They sometimes double a word. Therefore, we need not expound the extra occurrence.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Observation:</span> When the Torah includes (minor) boys, it includes even a one-day-old.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Ish (who has Keri is Tamei)" applies only to an adult!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "<i>V</i>'Ish" includes even a nine-year-old boy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> One of these is a tradition from Moshe from Sinai. The verse is only an Asmachta.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which is truly expounded, which is a tradition?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The law of Zivah is a tradition, and Keri is expounded.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The verse does not mention nine years. This must be a tradition!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Zivah is expounded, Keri is a tradition.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Keri is a tradition, what do we learn from "<i>v</i>'Ish" written regarding Keri?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Since we do not need it to teach about Keri,) it teaches about a woman who has white emissions. (She is Tehorah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need separate verses to teach about males and females?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it taught only about a (minor) boy (that he can become a Zav), one might have thought that this is due to the stringency of Zav. Three sightings in one day make a Zav, but sightings on three consecutive days are needed to make a Zavah. Perhaps a (minor) girl cannot become a Zavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about a girl, one might have thought this is due to the stringency of Zavah. Sightings b'Ones (due to an external cause) make a Zavah, but sightings b'Ones do not make a Zav. Perhaps a boy cannot become a Zav);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, both teachings are needed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>KUSI</i> MEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A (male) Kusi is Metamei a Mishkav below like one above...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If he sits on top of a stack of ten mattresses, he is Metamei all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is obvious. He is on all of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, a Mishkav below a Bo'el Nidah is like one above a Zav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a Mishkav above a Zav is only (a Rishon l'Tum'ah. It is) Metamei food and drink (but not people or Kelim), also a Mishkav below a Bo'el Nidah.</p>
