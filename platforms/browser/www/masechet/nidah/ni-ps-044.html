<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "V'Ishah" includes even a one day old girl (she can become a Nidah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A 10-day old girl can become a Zavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Ishah (who sees blood during three consecutive days of Zivah becomes a Zavah)" applies only to an adult!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Ishah" includes even a 10-day old.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A one-day old boy can become a Zav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Ish Ish" includes even a one-day old boy;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah says, we have a different source. "Veha'Zav Es Zovo la'Zachar ul'Nekevah" applies to a male or female of any age.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he learn from "Ish Ish"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah speaks like people do. (They sometimes double a word. Therefore, we need not expound the repetition.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A one-day old can become a Metzora.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>"<i>Adam</i> Ki Yiyeheh b'Or Besaro" refers to any person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He can become Tamei Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>"V'Al <i>ha'Nefashos</i> Asher Hayu Sham" refers to any souls.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OTHER LAWS OF A ONE-DAY OLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He obligates his brother's widow to do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We learn from "Ki Yeshvu Achim Yachdav." If the brothers lived at the same time (even for a moment), Yibum applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He exempts from Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Yibum applies only when "u'Ven Ein Lo." This man had a son!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He permits (his mother) to eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>We read "vi'Yelid Beiso Hem <i>Yochlu</i> v'Lachmo" like Ya'achilu (they will cause to eat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He (a Zar) forbids his mother (a Bas Kohen) to eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>A Bas Kohen widowed from a Yisrael returns to eat Terumah if "v'Zera Ein Lah." She has seed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Not only born seed forbids. Even a fetus forbids!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"(A Bas Kohen widowed from a Zar returns to eat Terumah in her father's house) ki'Ne'ureha" excludes a pregnant woman. The Torah needed to write both of these;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had it written only "v'Zera Ein Lah," one might have thought that a woman with a child does not return, for she "became" two people, unlike the way she left her father's house, but a pregnant woman returns;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Had it written only "ki'Ne'ureha," one might have thought that a pregnant woman does not return, for she was empty when she left, and now she is full, but if she gave birth (and is now empty), she returns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say that a one day old forbids? Even a fetus forbids!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Mishnah discusses a Kohen with children from a permitted wife, and a child (a Chalal) from a forbidden wife (e.g. a divorcee). The Kohen died, and left slaves to his children;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the Chalal inherits a share in the slaves, he forbids them to eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Our Tana argues with R. Yosi, who says that even a fetus forbids. (Already, the slaves are partially his. Tosfos - R. Yosi is concerned for the (minority) chance that the fetus is a viable male. Chachamim rely on the majority (it is a Nefel or female, it does not own a share). Rashi - Chachamim hold that a fetus has no ownership until it is born.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He inherits and bequeaths.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He inherits from his father, and bequeaths to his paternal brothers. What difference does it make? (Even if he did not inherit, his brothers inherit their father!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> He inherits from his mother, and bequeaths to his paternal brothers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if he was born before his mother died, but not if he was born afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When a pregnant woman dies, her fetus dies first. The fetus does not inherit his mother after he dies in order to bequeath to his paternal brothers.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">44b----------------------------------------44b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A case occurred, and the fetus quivered three times!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> Even though it died first, it still moves, just like a tail cut off of a lizard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> He is counted like a son when calculating the extra share of the firstborn.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Chachamim of Sura - Mar brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> A son born after the father died does not count in the calculation of the extra share of the firstborn. (E.g. if two sons were born before the father died, the extra share is a third of the estate. All (i.e. even posthumous) sons equally divide the remaining two thirds of the estate.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding the extra share it says "v'Yoldu Lo." (They were born in his lifetime.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Chachamim of Pumbadisa - Mar brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> A firstborn born after the father died (i.e. all the children were born posthumously) does not receive an extra share (the sons divide the estate equally).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding the extra share it says "Yakir" (the father will declare who is his firstborn. This applies only if they were born in his lifetime).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>The Halachah follows both teachings of Mar brei d'Rav Yosef.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If someone kills him, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>"V'Ish Ki Yakeh <i>Kol</i> Nefesh" refers to any soul.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MOURNING OVER THE LOSS OF A BABY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is like a grown man with respect to his relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> If he dies even on his first day, they mourn over him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (The entire Mishnah considers a one-day old to be a proper child.) This is unlike R. Shimon ben Gamliel, who says that a baby that lives 30 days is not a Nefel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A baby that died wihin 30 days is a Safek Nefel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The case is, we know that it had a full term pregnancy. Even R. Shimon is not concerned for a Nefel in this case.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>LAWS OF A THREE-YEAR OLD GIRL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A girl three years and one day old becomes Mekudeshes through Bi'ah (if her father wants);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a three-year old is widowed and does Yibum, it takes effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If another man has Bi'ah with a married three-year old, he is killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If she is a Nidah, one who has Bi'ah with her becomes Bo'el Nidah, he is Metamei a Mishkav to be (a Rishon l'Tum'ah,) like a Kli above (supported by) a Zav (even if he does not touch it);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If she does Nesu'in with a Kohen, she may eat Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If a Pasul (someone forbidden to a Bas Yisrael) has Bi'ah with her, he disqualifies her from Kehunah (marrying a Kohen and eating Terumah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If an Ervah (relative) punishable by Misah has Bi'ah with her, he is killed, and she is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If she is less than three, this is like sticking a finger in the eye. (This will be explained.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa #1 - R. Meir):</span> A three-year old becomes Mekudeshes through Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Chachamim say, she must be three years and one day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yanai):</span> R. Meir holds that she becomes Bas Bi'ah (old enough for Bi'ah) on the last day of her third year. Chachamim hold that this occurs on the morrow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> They argue about whether 30 days in the last year is considered like a full year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #2 - R. Meir):</span> A three-year old (is Bas Bi'ah), even if she is two years and one day;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, she must be three years and a day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is not difficult for R. Yochanan. Just like this Tana holds that R. Meir considers one day like a year, the Tana of Beraisa #1 says that he considers 30 days like a year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>However, this is difficult for R. Yanai!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
