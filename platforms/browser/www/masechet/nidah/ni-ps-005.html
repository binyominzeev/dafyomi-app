<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RETROACTIVE <i>TUM'AH</i> OF <i>KESAMIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> She can become retroactively Teme'ah even when she (properly) finds herself Teme'ah. I.e. not at the time of her Veses she is retroactively Teme'ah 24 hours.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Because she can become retroactively Teme'ah, her Kesem is retroactively Tamei, but the four women who are Dayan Sha'atan, also their Kesamim are Dayan Sha'atan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Chanina ben Antignos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing R. Chanina ben Antignos):</span> Kesamim of all women (except for the exceptions we will give) are retroactively Teme'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Any woman who is Dayah Sha'atah, the law of her Kesem is as if as she (properly) saw blood, except for a girl below the age (at which we expect her) to see blood;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>For such a girl, even if her sheet is full of blood, we are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chanina ben Antignos is not concerned for Kesamim at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Kesamim of all women are Teme'im, even women who are Dayan Sha'atan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Chanina ben Antignos says, women who are Dayan Sha'atan do not have Kesamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that their Kesamim are totally Tehorim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means that Dayan Sha'atan, but they are Teme'im from now and onwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that the first Tana holds that they are retroactively Teme'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Affirmation:</span> Yes! It is R. Meir, who is more stringent about Kesamim (Rashi - than about actual blood; Tosfos - than other Tana'im);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> All Kesamim are retroactively Teme'im, even of women who are Dayan Sha'atan (regarding a proper sighting);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Chanina ben Antignos says, the Kesem of a woman who is Dayah Sha'atah is like her blood. (It is Metamei her from now and onwards.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If a girl is at the age to see blood (even if she never saw yet), her Kesem is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If she is not yet at the age, her Kesem is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The age to see is the age of Na'arus (Rambam - 12 years and two hairs; Rashi - 12 years <i>or</i> two hairs).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>BEDIKOS</i> AT THE TIME OF RELATIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Bedikos were done at the time of relations, this limits the law of retroactive Tum'ah (like a Bedikah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Bedikah done before relations does not count as a Bedikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ketina):</span> She is hurrying to have relations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does this invalidate the Bedikah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because she is hurrying, she does not insert the cloth into crevices.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Bedikos were done at the time of relations, this limits the law of retroactive Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Bedikos (plural) teaches that before and after are both valid (to limit retroactive Tum'ah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, it refers to two Bedikos done after. Also he checks himself (lest blood is on his Ever).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Benos Yisrael do two Bedikos at the time of relations -- one for her, and one for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one of the Bedikos is before relations, we understand the Chidush of our Mishnah. Even though she is hurrying, we rely on the Bedikah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Mishnah discusses Bedikos after relations, what is the Chidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that perhaps there was a drop of blood and it was covered by semen. The Mishnah teaches that we are not concerned for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (g)):</span> The Mishnah teaches that Chachamim obligate women to check themselves before and after relations;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah also teaches that the Bedikah after relations is considered a Bedikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "<i>If</i> Bedikos were done" connotes that they are optional!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> The Mishnah should say "she <i>must</i> do Bedikos."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (The Bedikah at the time of relations) lessens retroactive Tum'ah from 24 hours or (if a Bedikah was done within this time) from the previous Bedikah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it lessens Tum'ah from 24 hours (Rashi - a large period of time; Tosfos - even though this is when she transgressed, i.e. she omitted the Bedikah of the previous morning or evening), all the more so it lessens from the previous Bedikah!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Chachamim were concerned for a large loss of Taharos (24 hours, so then they consider it like a Bedikah), but not for a small loss (when the previous Bedikah was within 24 hours.) The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DA'AS LISH'OL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When we say that Dayah Sha'atah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It would have sufficed to say "if she was handling Taharos." Why does the Mishnah also mention "if she was sitting on a bed"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that if she was not Dayah Sha'atah, also the bed would also be Tamei. It supports Ze'iri;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> If a woman sat on a Mishkav or Moshav (a Kli made to sit or lie on) during the 24 hours (of retroactive Tum'ah before she found herself to be Nidah), she makes it an Av ha'Tum'ah to be Metamei Begadim. (It is Metamei a person and the garments he wears (or touches) when he sits on or touches it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would the bed be Tamei? We are Metaher cases of Safek Tum'ah regarding Ein Bo Da'as Lisha'el!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ze'iri):</span> The case is, other women were carrying the bed when she was on it. The bed is like their hands (Yesh Bo Da'as Lisha'el).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Even if the bed is on the ground, it is considered Yesh Bo Da'as Lisha'el due to R. Yochanan's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Safek cases of Tum'ah that arise through people are Tamei in Reshus ha'Yachid;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even if the Kli rests on the ground, it is considered Yesh Bo Da'as Lisha'el.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a man was surrounded by Taharos and Avos ha'Tum'ah, and he cloaked himself with a (Tahor or Tamei) garment, and he is unsure if it touched them, whatever was Tahor remains Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is (Tosfos - almost) impossible that it did not touch, the garment became and/or made the Taharos Teme'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, we tell him to put it on again to see if it touches when he puts it on.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We do not make such tests (Tosfos - to be lenient) regarding Taharos!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, this should be considered Yesh Bo Da'as Lisha'el. We should always be Metamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, R. Hoshaya explained that we are Metaher only in Reshus ha'Rabim. We are Metamei in Reshus ha'Yachid (like the law of Yesh Bo Da'as Lisha'el).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> If a woman sat on a Mishkav or Moshav during the 24 hours (of retroactive Tum'ah), she makes it an Av ha'Tum'ah to be Metamei a person and his garments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Avimi's Beraisa):</span> During the 24 hours, a Mishkav or Moshav that she sat on is like (a Kli that) she touches.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like a Kli that she touches is not Metamei people, also her Mishkav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> A Kal va'Chomer disproves this!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Kli Cheres with a Tzamid Pasil (it is plastered shut) does not become Tamei in an Ohel with a Mes, but a Nidah is Metamei it retroactively (as if she touched it after seeing blood. We will explain how Rava knew this.) A Mishkav or Moshav, which becomes Tamei in Ohel ha'Mes, all the more so a Nidah is Metamei it retroactively (as if she sat on it after seeing blood, and makes it an Av ha'Tum'ah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Avimi cited a Beraisa! (Rava must agree to it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> It means that a Mishkav or Moshav on which she sat is Metamei (one who sits on it) like she is Metamei someone she touches, i.e. she makes him and his clothes Teme'im.</p>
