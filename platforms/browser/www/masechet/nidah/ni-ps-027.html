<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE TIME BETWEEN THE BIRTH OF TWINS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rebbi is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Shila):</span> A case occurred, and Chachamim attributed a Shilya to a baby born 10 days earlier.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We attribute a Shilya to a baby only if the baby came out before it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> A case occurred, and Chachamim attributed a Shilya to a baby born 23 days earlier.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> You told us 24!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rav Avira):</span> A case occurred in which a baby was born 33 days after its twin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> You told us 34!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand according to the opinion that the ninth month (of a viable baby born in the ninth month) need not be complete. (The first baby was born after seven full months, and its twin was born about four days into the ninth month);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to the opinion that the ninth month must be complete, how can this happen? (It cannot be that both babies were born in the seventh month; if one was born in (i.e. at the end of) the ninth month, the other was born in the eighth, it is surely a Nefel!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must switch the episodes, and say that a baby was born <i>23</i> days after its twin (both in the seventh month) and that Chachamim attributed a Shilya to a baby born 33 days earlier.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin bar Rav Ada):</span> Once, a baby was born three months after its twin. The twins are in this Beis Medrash. They are Yehudah and Chizkiyah, the sons of R. Chiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (They could not have been conceived at the same time.) However, it was taught that a pregnant woman cannot become pregnant with a second fetus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Indeed, they were conceived at the same time. One of them was born at the beginning of the seventh month, and the other was born at the end of the ninth month.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TUM'AH OF A SHILYA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Shilya is in a house, the house is Tamei...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a Shilya is in a house, the house is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not because a Shilya is a child, rather, because there is always a child with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi, R. Yehudah and R. Shimon are Metaher the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan (R. Yosi,... ):</span> Don't you agree that if the Shilya was taken in a basket to another house, the latter house is Tahor?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> Yes, because moving it causes it to dissolve.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> It was already dissolved in the first house!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> Moving it dissolves it more.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> R. Shimon holds that Tum'ah mixed with (a larger quantity of) another species is Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Is this also the reason for R. Yosi and R. Yehudah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Hamnuna and Rav Bivi laughed. Of course it is!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> One should ask such questions from his Rebbi (even if he will be laughed at. Perhaps he will learn something from the answer);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Im Navalta v'Hisnasei v'Im Zamosa Yad l'Feh." (One who disgraces himself for the sake of learning will be elevated. One who does not ask will not be able to answer).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TUM'AH OF REKEV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Shimon holds similarly elsewhere;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (A Tarvad (spoonful, what one can contain in his hands) of Rekev (the decayed flesh of a Mes) is Tamei like a Mes.) If a small amount of earth fell into it, it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabanan):</span> Surely, there is a grain of Rekev is between two grains of earth. It is Batel (and less than a Tarvad of Rekev remains).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rabah):</span> Surely, a grain of earth is between two grains of Rekev. It is Batel to the Rekev, there is more than a spoonful!(Ramban - it is more likely that the minority is Batel is the majority!)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> R. Shimon holds that Rekev at the end (after it mixed with something else) is like its initial formation (if anything else corroded with a Mes to form Rekev, it is not considered Rekev);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Mes was buried naked in a marble coffin or on a stone floor, its Rekev is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Mes was buried clothed, or in a wooden coffin or on a brick floor, its Rekev is Tahor. (The clothes, wood or bricks decayed with the Mes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rekev applies only if it was a natural death, but not if he was murdered. (Then it is not a full Mes. It lacks some of the blood.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a small amount of earth fell into a Tarvad of Rekev, it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Shimon says, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If a spoonful of Rekev was scattered in a house, it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Shimon says, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>We must teach the argument in both cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had we taught only when earth fell in, one might have thought that only there Chachamim are Metamei, for all the Rekev is together, but they admit if it was scattered, for it is not all under one (part of the) Ohel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had we taught only when it was scattered, one might have thought that only there R. Shimon is Metaher, for it is not all under one (part of the) Ohel; but he admits if it is together and earth fell in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> More than a Tarvad of Rekev Beis ha'Kevaros (Rashi - from a cemetery. Alternatively, it is from a Mes buried in clothing. Tosfos - it is pure Rekev in which bits of plaster fell) is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Shimon says, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely, it contains a Tarvad of proper Rekev.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If R. Shimon is Metaher a mixture of Rekev because its end is like its beginning, why is he Metaher a Shilya?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He is Metaher because it is Batel in a majority (of Dam Leidah).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>TUM'AH</i> OF A <i>MES</i> THAT CHANGED FORM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Yochanan taught similarly elsewhere;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Shimon (regarding Shilya) and R. Eliezer ben Yakov agree with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> If a cake of dried blood fell from the womb of a large animal (which did not give birth before), we bury the cake, and its next calf is not a Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chiya):</span> The cake does not have Tum'ah Maga (touching) or Masa (moving).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is not Tamei, it is not considered a Nevelah. (It has no Kedushas Bechor.) Why must it be buried?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is to publicize that the next calf is not a Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the next calf is not a Bechor, the cake must be a proper child.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did R. Chiya say that the cake does not have Tum'ah Maga or Masa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It is Tahor because it is Batel in a majority (of blood).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami citing R. Yochanan):</span> R. Shimon agrees that (if a woman miscarried a Shilya) she is a Yoledes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(An elder):</span> R. Yochanan learns from "Ishah Ki Sazri'a" -- even if she only gave birth to something (that liquefied, and is) like what she was Mazri'ah (her seed), she is a Yoledes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If a Shefir was cut up in the water it was washed in (alternatively, in blood and natal secretions), since it lost its form, it is Tahor, like a Mes that lost its form.</p>
