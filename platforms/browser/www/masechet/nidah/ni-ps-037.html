<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES <i>DAM KOSHI</i> CANCEL THE CLEAN DAYS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Does blood seen b'Koshi Soser (cancel all) the clean days already counted after Zivah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tamei blood is Soser, and this blood is Tamei. (She is still a Zavah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps only blood that is Gorem (causes Tum'as Zivah ) is Soser. This blood is not Gorem!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We learn from Zov that a man sees b'Ones. It is not Gorem, but it is Soser!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> That is also Gorem!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The first two times a man sees Zov, we check him. The third time, we do not check him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We learn from R. Eliezer. He says that we check the third time. Will you say that since the third sighting is not Gorem b'Ones, it is not Soser?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Indeed according to R. Eliezer [since a third sighting b'Ones is not Gorem, it is not Soser]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> We check on the third sighting, but not on the fourth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We need not check the fourth sighting, for even b'Ones it is Soser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, we need not check regarding the Zov itself, for it has Tum'as Masa even b'Ones. (However, if it was b'Ones, it is not Soser.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> We check on the third sighting, but not on the fourth. We check only to know if he brings a Korban. (However, in any case he is Soser!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Indeed, according to R. Eliezer even though something (e.g. a third sighting b'Ones) is not Gorem, it is Soser. I ask according to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Avin's father - Beraisa):</span> Zov is Gorem (causes) a man to be Tamei for seven days, therefore it is Soser seven days;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Semen causes a man to be Tamei for one day, therefore it is Soser one day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Zov Soser seven days?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is Soser seven because a man who sees Zov (twice) is Tamei for seven days.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Beraisa should have said this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Beraisa specifies that Zov is <i>Gorem</i> Tum'ah, to teach that only what is Gorem is Soser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Blood seen b'Koshi does not Soser (clean days counted after) Zivah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Tana says that it is, it is R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS TUM'AS YOLEDES SOSER?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Merinus):</span> Tum'as Yoledes is not Soser Zivah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do clean days during Tum'as Yoledes count (towards the seven clean days that a Zavah must count?) (Tosfos - we ask according to R. Merinus.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> They are not Soser, but they do not count.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> They are not Soser, and they count.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> "V'Achar Tit'har" teaches that Tum'ah may not be in the middle (of the seven clean days).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, if the days count, they are not considered Tum'ah, so they are not Soser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if they do not count, they should be Soser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> "V'Achar Tit'har" teaches that there may not be Tum'as Zivah in the middle, but Tum'as Yoledes is not Soser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava, for himself - Beraisa):</span> "(A Zavah will become Tehorah) mi'Zovah" -- she may become Tehorah from her Zivah alone, even if she is Teme'ah due to Tzara'as or birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa should say "... even if she is Teme'ah due to Tzara'as." (It should not mention birth.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> "(A Zav will become Tahor) mi'Zovo" -- a Zav may become Tahor from Zivah, even if he is a Metzora (and similarly, a Zavah who is a Metzora'as);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, if the Beraisa mentions a Metzora'as and a Yoledes, we can say that Yoledes was truly learned from "mi'Zovah," and Metzora'as (which is really learned from "mi'Zovo") was appended;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if it teaches only about a Metzora'as, why must it learn from "mi'Zovah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Torah must teach about a (Metzora who is a) Zav and a (Metzora'as who is a) Zavah. Neither could be learned from the other:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about a Zav, one might have thought that this is because one does not become a Zav through Ones, therefore he can become Tahor even when he has Tzara'as. However, a Zavah, who becomes Teme'ah through Ones, must first become Tehorah from Tzara'as;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">37b----------------------------------------37b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only about a Zavah, one might have thought that this is because three days are needed to become a Zavah, but one can become a Zav (through three sightings) in one day. He cannot become Tahor until he is Tahor from Tzara'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye, for himself - Beraisa):</span> "Devosah Titma" includes Bo'el Yoledes (he is like Bo'el Nidah). It includes the nights (Tum'as Yoledes applies also at night), and it teaches that Yoledes b'Zov must count seven clean days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The days must be clean from Tum'as Yoledes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they must be clean from blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye, for himself - Beraisa):</span> The Torah equates the days of Tum'as Yoledes to the days of Nidah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the days of Nidah, in which she cannot become a Zavah, do not count towards seven clean days, the same applies to days of Tum'as Yoledes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> R. Eliezer taught that Beraisa. He says that the days are even Soser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we learn from the days of Nidah? It is impossible for them to count towards the seven clean days! (If a Zavah sees blood before seven clean days, it is not Nidah. It is Soser her clean days.) Days of Tum'as Yoledes could count!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #1 (Rav Achdevoy bar Ami):</span> The Beraisa is R. Eliezer, who says that we learn what is possible from what is impossible.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> Since the Torah equated the days of Nidah and the days of Tum'as Yoledes, all agree that we learn one from the other. (Tosfos - this is because since there is nothing else to learn from the Hekesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rav Achdevoy gave Answer #1 in the name of Rav Sheshes. Rav Papa gave Answer #2.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>RESPITE FROM <i>KOSHI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman saw blood for three days (... the respite must be from the pain, and not from the blood).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What if she had respite from the pain and the blood?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> She is a Zavah. (It is as if there was respite.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina):</span> She is Tehorah. (It is as if there was no respite.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> This is like a king who went out. His soldiers went in front of him. Surely, they went due to him (even if he delays coming a day or two. Here also, the blood and pain were due to the upcoming birth!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> All the more so, there will be many soldiers right before the king comes! (Here also, if they were due to the birth, they should have become more intense when the birth gets closer!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Chisda - Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> The respite must be for a Halachic day, e.g. Shabbos. The respite must be from the pain, and not from the blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the respite was from the pain and the blood, she is Tehorah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches a bigger Chidush:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She is a Zavah not only if the respite was from the pain and the blood, and the Simanim of birth ceased entirely. Rather, it is even if the respite was only from the pain, but not from the blood;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One might have thought that the blood proves that she is still amidst labor. She did not feel the pain because she was dazed. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Chanina - Mishnah):</span> If a woman saw blood b'Koshi for three consecutive days during the 11 days of Zivah, and had 24 hours respite before giving birth, she is Yoledes b'Zov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be like the simple understanding. There is no need for three days b'Koshi. Two days b'Koshi suffice, and the third day can be amidst respite!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It means that she saw blood b'Koshi for three consecutive days, and had respite from the pain and the blood, or if she saw blood b'Koshi for two consecutive days, and saw blood on the third amidst respite from the pain.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This refutes R. Chanina.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question 1):</span> Really, it is like the simple understanding. It teaches that even though the blood was amidst Koshi all three days, she is Yoledes b'Zov, unlike Chananya.</p>
