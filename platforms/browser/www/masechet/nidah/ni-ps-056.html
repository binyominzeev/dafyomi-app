<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the Tum'ah of urine of a Zav?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Zovo Tamei (Hu); <i>v'Zos</i>" teaches that his urine is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach this! Spit comes from a Tahor place, yet a Zav's spit is Tamei. Urine comes from a Tamei place (the source of Zov). All the more so it should be Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Blood that leaves through the Ever disproves this. It comes from a Tamei place, yet it is Tahor. Perhaps the same applies to urine!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Therefore, it says "... v'Zos" to include urine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to be Metaher blood that leaves through the Ever?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps blood that leaves through a Zav's mouth or Ever is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Zovo Tamei Hu" teaches that his Zov is Tamei, but not blood from his mouth or Ever.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (These verses do not specify what to be Metaher or Metamei.) Perhaps we should be Metaher urine and be Metamei blood, and not vice-versa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Presumably, we are Metamei something like spit (which the Torah explicitly is Metamei), which accumulates before leaving;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This excludes blood, which leaves right away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Milk accumulates before leaving, yet it has only Tum'as Mashkim. It is not an Av ha'Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Yochanan said that we are Metamei something like spit, which accumulates before leaving and can be reabsorbed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This excludes blood, which leaves right away. It excludes milk, for even though it accumulates before leaving, it cannot be reabsorbed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn from Zov? It does not accumulate before leaving!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We cannot learn from Zov, for it causes Tum'ah to others (the Zav).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> A partial Sheretz is Tamei only if it is moist. A full Sheretz is Tamei even if it is dry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yitzchak b'Rebbi Bisna) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Bahem" teaches that only a full Sheretz is Tamei!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> These are Tamei only if they are moist.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>We learn about Zov (that it is Tamei only if it is moist) from "<i>Rar</i> Besaro." (This is like Rir (saliva), which is moist.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Kicho, Ni'o and spit are Tamei only if they are moist. (We learn Kicho and Ni'o from spit, regarding which) It says "v'Chi Yarok ha'Zav." it must be moist, like when he spit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A Sheretz is Tamei only if it is moist. We learn from "b'Mosam". It must be like the time of death.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A k'Zayis of it is Tahor, but Malei Tarvad (a spoonful) of it is Tamei due to Rekev (decayed flesh).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Sheretz was found in a Mavoy (alleyway), all Taharos that were there are retroactively Teme'im, up to the last time it was checked for Sheratzim or swept;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Similarly, if a Kesem was found on Leah's garment, she and it are retroactively Teme'im, up to the last time she checked it or washed it.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they are moist, it applies retroactively as long as it would be possible for them to still be moist.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why isn't the Mavoy retroactively Tamei from before the last sweeping? Is it because we assume that the sweeper checked for Sheratzim, or because we assume that they would have been swept up?</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The sweeper says that he did not check;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If we (normally) assume that the sweeper checked, here we know that he did not;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If we assume that Sheratzim would have been swept up, this still applies.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> A Sheretz was found in a crevice;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If we assume that the sweeper checked, he would check even in crevices;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If we assume that Sheratzim would have been swept up, this does not apply inside crevices. (The Gemara asks a related question, and then answers both questions.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Why isn't it Tamei from before the last laundering? Do we assume that she checked for Kesamim when she laundered it, or do we assume that the laundering would have removed them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> She says that she did not check when she laundered it;</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If we assume that laundering removes Kesamim, this does not apply inside hems.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Answer to both questions - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The reason why when a Sheretz is found in a Mavoy, Taharos are retroactively Teme'im (only) up to the last time it was checked for Sheratzim or swept, is because of the Chazakah that Bnei Yisrael check for Sheratzim when sweeping;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they did not check, they lose. (Taharos are Teme'im from even before it was swept.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Kesem was found on Leah's garment, the Tum'ah is retroactive up to the last time she checked it or washed it. This is due to the Chazakah that Benos Yisrael check for Kesamim when laundering;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she did not check, she loses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Acha says, she should launder it again;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the Kesem gets washed away, this shows that it came after the previous laundering;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it is not washed away, perhaps it was from before the previous laundering.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rebbi says, a Kesem looks different before and after laundering. Beforehand it is on the surface, afterwards it is inside the fabric.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of answers:</span> The Tum'os are limited due to the Chazakah that Yisraelim check when sweeping and laundering.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Whether the Sheretz or Kesem is dry or moist... (R. Shimon says, if they are moist, we are Metamei retroactively as long as it would be possible for them to still be moist.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> R. Shimon discusses only Sheratzim. He does not limit retroactive Tum'ah of a moist Kesem. Perhaps it dried up and water came on it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Similarly, he should be concerned lest a moist Sheretz had dried up, and water came on it!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH <i>KESAMIM</i> ARE <i>TEME'IM</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Garments with) Kesamim that come from Rekem (a city) are Tehorim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah is Metamei, because they are converts and they err.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Kesamim that come from Nochrim are Tehorim. (Mid'Oraisa, Nochrim are Tehorim. Chachamim decreed to consider a Nochris a Nidah, but they did not decree about her Kesamim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir is Metamei Kesamim that come from Yisraelim and from Kusim. (Kusim are Nochrim whom Sancheriv settled in place of the ten exiled Shevatim. Lions were eating them, so they converted. They do not follow enactments or teachings of Chachamim. They follow Mitzvos mentioned in the Torah, according to their literal understanding. Once, they were found serving their old idolatry. Some say that this shows that their conversion was invalid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim are Metaher, for they are not suspected about their Kesamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The Mishnah is Metaher all Kesamim that come from Nochrim, even from Tarmud (a city)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This teaches that we accept converts from Tarmud (and they may marry Yisraelim. We are not concerned lest they are Mamzerim descended from women from the ten Shevatim who conceived from Nochrim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> R. Yochanan and elders taught that we do not accept converts from Tarmud!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yochanan teaches that our Mishnah holds that we accept. He himself argues.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan says that the Halachah follows a Stam Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Amoraim argue about the opinion of R. Yochanan. (Those who say that he does not accept converts from Tarmud hold that he never said that the Halachah follows a Stam Mishnah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Chachamim are Metaher) Kesamim that come from Yisraelim and from Kusim.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated, it means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kesamim of Yisraelim are Teme'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir is Metamei Kesamim of Kusim, for their conversion was valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim are Metaher Kesamim of Kusim, for their conversion was due to the lions. (It was invalid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Mishnah does not give this reason. Rather, it says that Chachamim are Metaher because Kusim are not suspected about their Kesamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, (the Mishnah is abbreviated;) it means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kesamim that come from (cities of) Yisraelim and Kusim are Teme'im, for (perhaps they are of Kusim, and) their conversion was valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Kesamim that come from cities of Yisraelim are Tehorim, for Yisraelim are not suspected about their Kesamim. They hide away all Tamei Kesamim.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kesamim found in all places are Tehorim, except for those found in rooms (presumably, they were put there because they are Teme'im) or near Beis ha'Teme'os (where women stay when they are Nidah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis ha'Teme'os of Kusim have Tum'as Ohel, for they (Tosfos - temporarily) bury Nefalim there;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, (it does not have Tum'as Ohel for they do not bury Nefalim. Rather,) they cast them where animals take them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A Kusi is believed to say whether or not a Nefel was buried in a certain place, and whether or not an animal already gave birth (if it did, its next offspring is not a Bechor), and about Tziyon Kevaros (lines above a grave demarcating where there is Tum'as Ohel);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>He is not believed about Sechachos, Pera'os or Beis ha'Peras. (These will be explained);</p>
