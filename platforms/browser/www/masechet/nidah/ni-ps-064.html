<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>VESES</i> OF SKIPPING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> If a woman saw on the 15th of the month, on the 16th of the next month and on the 17th of the third month, she has established a Veses of skipping.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> She does not establish a Veses (of skipping) until she sees three times after the same interval.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav and Shmuel argue like Rebbi and R. Shimon ben Gamliel (about whether Chazakah is established after two or three occurrences)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If Leah married a man and he died, she may remarry. If she married a second man and he died, she may not remarry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, she may marry a third time, but if her third husband dies, she may not remarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, both hold like R. Shimon ben Gamliel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav counts the 15th as one of the three times. Shmuel does not count it, for it did not come after the skip (that will be her Veses).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (again Rav - Beraisa):</span> If a woman normally sees on the 15th, and she saw on the 16th, both of these are forbidden. If she saw (next month) on the 17th, the 16th is permitted, and the 15th and 17th are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she saw (next month) on the 18th, all these days are permitted, only (the day) after the 18th is forbidden (the 19th, for this is a Veses of skipping).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since she normally used to see on the 15th, it does not count towards a Veses of skipping.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The answer is obvious. Why did the questioner ask?! (Gilyon ha'Shas - he should have asked against Shmuel, why the Beraisa specifies that she normally used to see on the 15th!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must teach about this case. One might have thought that after seeing twice on other days, she is no longer concerned for the 15th. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so. (She does not uproot it until three times.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> If a woman saw on the 21st of the month, and on the 22nd of the next month, and the 23rd of the third month, she fixed a Veses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she skipped (in the third month) and saw on the 24th, she did not fix a Veses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she normally sees (and saw the previous month) on the 20th.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> The Tana normally begins with the 20th (to teach as concisely as possible). Presumably, he began with 21 because she already saw on the 20th last month.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ESTABLISHING AND UPROOTING A <i>VESES</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman does not establish a Veses until three times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The Veses is not Kavu'a until three times (to uproot other Vestos, and in order that it will not be uprooted until she changes from it three times). However, whatever day she sees, even though she saw only once, she is concerned for it (the next month).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learn this from our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman normally sees on the 15th of the month, and saw on the 20th, both of these days are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that this is only if the new day is among the days of Nidah (Rashi - the new day begins Nidah, it is not amidst the days of Zivah (within 18 days of her previous sighting); Me'iri - had she seen on the 15th as usual, the 20th would have been the sixth day of Nidah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Papa teaches that this is even if it is not among the days of Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She does not lose a Veses until three times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This refers to a Veses fixed through three sightings, but if she saw on a day only (once or) twice, she uproots it after changing from it once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learn this from our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman does not fix a Veses until three times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought if she saw on a day once, she uproots it after changing from it once, but if she saw on a day twice, she does not uproot it until changing from it twice. Rav Papa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Papa - Beraisa):</span> If a woman normally sees on the 20th of the month, and saw on the 30th, both days are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the 20th came (next month) and she did not see, she is permitted until the 30th, she must refrain from Bi'ah on the 30th;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she saw again on the 30th, and next month she did not see on the 20th or 30th, and next month she saw on the 20th, the 20th is forbidden and the 30th is permitted, for the guest (blood) comes in its proper time. (Tosfos ha'Rosh - the 30th is permitted once she did not see on it, even before she saw the next month on the 20th.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SOME WOMEN HAVE LESS BLOOD THAN OTHERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Dam) Besulim of women is compared to vines. (Me'iri - we learn from "Eshtecha k'Gefen Poriyah", Tehilim 128:3);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some vines yield red wine, and others yield black wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Some vines yield much wine, and others yield little.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, every (normal) vine yields wine. One that does not is Durkati. (In certain families, the women do not have Dam Besulim or Dam Nidah. The Rambam says that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah. I.e. we are not concerned if women from such families do not have Dam Besulim. This implies that Chachamim argue, and deny that such families exist.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> (Durkati stands for) Dor Katu'a. (The generation is cut off. The Rambam explains that she is totally strerile. We must say that such families are from paternal descent, for no woman has children! Rashi explains that the women have few children.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chiya):</span> Just like Se'or (sourdough) is good for (fermenting) a dough, blood is good for a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a woman has much blood, it is a sign that she will have many children.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK TINOKES</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN WE ATTRIBUTE BLOOD TO <i>DAM BESULIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If a girl below the age when she expects to see Dam (Nidah, i.e. she is a Ketanah) was married, we "give" her four nights. (During them, she attributes all blood to Dam Besulim, and she is Tehorah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel gives her (Rambam - only; Me'iri - the greater of four nights or) until the wound (the breaking of the Besulim) heals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Shamai says, if she reached the age when she expects to see (Na'arus) and was married, we give her the first night;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Beis Hillel gives her four nights, until Motza'ei Shabbos. (We assume that she was married on Wednesday, like was enacted for Besulos - Kesuvos 2a.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Beis Shamai says, if she saw blood before she was married, we give her only Bi'as Mitzvah (the first act of Bi'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Beis Hillel gives her the entire first night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The Reisha applies even to a Ketanah who already saw Dam Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa distinguishes between whether or not she saw before. This implies that the Reisha does not distinguish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - Beis Hillel):</span> We give her until the wound heals, whether or not she saw beforehand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Until the wound heals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> It is as long as she is Nocheres.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> I do not know what is "Nocheres"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> It is as long as she sees due to Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Nechirah that Rav mentioned?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak citing Rav):</span> If she sees blood when she stands (Me'iri - the walls of the womb rub against each other), but not when she sits, the wound has not healed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she sees when she sits on the ground, but not when she sits on pillows and blankets, the wound has not healed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If (sometimes) she sees when she sits on anything, and other times she does not see when sitting on anything, the wound has healed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>HOW LONG ARE WE <i>TOLEH</i> ON <i>DAM BESULIM</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she reached the age... (Beis Hillel gives her four nights).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If she had Bi'ah during the day, she still gets four nights;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Levi):</span> She loses a night for every day of Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> The Mishnah says 'until Motza'ei Shabbos' (whether or not she had Bi'ah during the day)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> It says 'she gets four nights. This means four Onos. (An Onah is a day (from Migo until evening) <i>or</i> night.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav, why does it say "four <i>nights</i>"? (She gets four full days!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches that it is proper to have Bi'ah at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Levi, why does it say "four nights <i>until Motza'ei Shabbos</i>"? (She gets four Onos. This could be within two or three days!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) Answer:</span> This permits Bi'ah for the first time on Shabbos (even though he causes some Dam Besulim to come out), like Shmuel taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi) Answer:</span> This permits Bi'ah (with a girl who has had Bi'ah only twice before) on Shabbos, like Shmuel taught: (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may enter through a narrow opening on Shabbos, even if he will rub against the sides and (might) cause pebbles to fall. (He does not intend to make them fall, and it is not inevitable. Shmuel holds like R. Shimon, who permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> If a Besulah did not see blood after the first Bi'ah, but saw after the second, she is Teme'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> She is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> She is Teme'ah. If it were Dam Besulim, it would have come out the first time. (Me'iri - even though she had prior Bi'ah, we are not concerned lest she is forbidden to her husband (if he is a Yisrael) due to Sotah, for there are two doubts. Perhaps she had Bi'ah before Kidushin, and even if it was after, perhaps she was forced. Indeed, if he is a Kohen, she is forbidden. The present discussion is only about Nidah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> She is Tehorah. We assume that the first time, Hatiyah occurred (the Ever entered without breaking the Besulim), like Shmuel:</p>
