<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BI'AH BEFORE THREE YEARS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she is less than three, this is like sticking a finger in the eye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a girl less than three has Bi'ah, what happens to the Besulim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Are they broken, and they grow back later?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, they are not broken, and they will be broken the first time she has Bi'ah after three?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If a man had Bi'ah with his wife before three and blood came out, and there was no blood after the first Bi'ah after three:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the Besulim are broken, we can say that they did not have a chance to grow back because he regularly had Bi'ah with her;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If they are not broken before three, surely another man had Bi'ah with her after three before her husband. This makes her a Zonah. (She is permanently forbidden to Kehunah. If her husband is a Yisrael, she is permitted to him. Even if a minor willingly had Bi'ah, it is considered Ones.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Ika):</span> Why should we assume that (if the Besulim are broken) they need time to grow back? Perhaps this happens immediately! (If so, in any case, she is a Zonah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, if blood came out after Bi'ah before three, and also after the first Bi'ah after three (either way, the latter blood is surely Dam Besulim):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the Besulim are broken and grow back, also the blood before three years was Dam Besulim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If they are not broken before three, the blood before three years was Dam Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda - Mishnah):</span> If she is less than three, this is like sticking a finger in the eye.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should have said "Bi'ah before three is not considered Bi'ah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, this teaches that Besulim are like an eye. Tears come out, and then more tears. Likewise, the Besulim are broken and grow back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yustni (Antoninus' granddaughter) asked Rebbi "what is the earliest a girl may (fully) marry (i.e. Nesu'in)? What is the youngest that a girl can get pregnant (and bear children)?"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> She can marry after three years and a day. She can get pregnant after 12 years and a day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yustni:</span> I married at the age of six, and delivered at the age of seven. Woe to me that I did not marry three years earlier!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could she get pregnant so young?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi - Beraisa):</span> Three women use a tuft to prevent pregnancy: a minor, a pregnant woman, and a nursing woman. (Rashi - they <i>may</i> use a contraceptive tuft at the time of Bi'ah. Tosfos - this is forbidden! Rather, they <i>must</i> use a tuft <i>after</i> Bi'ah to remove the semen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A minor does so, lest she get pregnant and die;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>A pregnant woman does so lest the fetus get mashed (Rashi - if a second fetus is conceived; Tosfos (Yevamah 12b) - this is impossible. Rather, we are concerned lest there are already two fetuses inside, and semen will enter between them);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>A nursing woman does so lest pregnancy force her to wean her baby (prematurely), and he will die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir says, we are concerned for a minor between 11 and 12. Before this (she cannot become pregnant) or after this (pregnancy is not dangerous), she has Bi'ah normally.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, all women have Bi'ah normally. Hash-m will have mercy on them -- "Shomer Pesa'im Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Besar Chamorim Besaram" (Nochrim are like animals. They conceive at younger ages.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Pihem Diber Shav" (she lied).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A woman told R. Akiva, "I had Bi'ah before three (with a Pasul). Am I permitted to Kehunah?"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The woman:</span> At first I did not want to, but in the end I desired it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> If so, you are disqualified from Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>His Talmidim looked bewildered, R. Akiva asked them why.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">The Talmidim:</span> A tradition from Moshe from Sinai teaches that Bi'ah before three years does not disqualify from Kehunah! (It is not considered Bi'ah at all.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Akiva intentionally gave the wrong ruling to test his Talmidim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A NINE-YEAR OLD BOY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Yavam nine years and one day old did Yibum, it takes effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may not divorce her until he becomes an adult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he is Bo'el Nidah, he is Metamei a Mishkav to be (a Rishon l'Tum'ah) like a Kli above a Zav;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he has Bi'ah with a woman forbidden to him, he disqualifies her from Kehunah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>He does not permit his wife to eat Terumah (even if he acquired her, e.g. through Yibum);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If he commits bestiality, the animal is killed (if there were two witnesses. If not), he disqualifies the animal from being a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If he has Bi'ah with an Ervah punishable by Misah, she is killed, and he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> It does not suffice to divorce her when he becomes an adult!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a nine-year old boy did Yibum, mid'Rabanan it acquires like a Ma'amar (Kidushin d'Rabanan of a Yevamah to her Yavam. Tosfos (Kidushin 19a) - mid'Oraisa, Yibum of a minor has no effect. Rashi - mid'Oraisa, it is full Yibum. Chachamim enacted that it acquires <i>only</i> like a Ma'amar.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Yavam wants to divorce after a Ma'amar, he must give a Get to undo the Ma'amar, and do Chalitzah to remove her Zikah (obligation to do Yibum). Likewise, if a nine-year old did Yibum, his Get (when he matures) must be accompanied by Chalitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> It means, if he had Bi'ah with her after he matured (which is full Yibum), he can divorce her. (Chalitzah is not needed.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>VOWS OF MINORS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a girl above 11 (full) years vows (or is Makdish an item), we check her (to see if she understands that Nedarim and Hekdesh are to Hash-m);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a girl above 12 vows, it is valid. (We do not check her);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>During her 12th year, we check her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If a boy above 12 years vows, we check him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If a boy above 13 vows, it is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>During his 13th year we check him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>(In this entire discussion, the law of a girl is the same as that of a boy one year older.) If he vows before (12 full years), even if he knows (that vows and Hekdesh are to Hash-m), it does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he vows after (13 full years), even if he says that he did not know, it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Once the Mishnah teaches that we check her vows from 11 years, why must it teach that they are valid after 12? (Surely, we need not check after adulthood!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we must always check (until we see that she understands). The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Once the Mishnah teaches that we do not check her vows after 12 years, why must it teach that during her 12th year we check? This follows from the previous two laws!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since 30 days in a year are considered like a year, one might have thought that if she did not know in the first 30 days of year 12, we need not check the rest of the year. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should suffice to teach the last two clauses, that we check during year 12, and not afterwards!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that normally, we check during year 12, but not before, but if we know that she is sharp, we check during year 11. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need the last two clauses, "... before this... " and "... after this... "?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that normally, we assume that a vow before (this year) is invalid, and a vow afterwards is valid, but if he himself tells us otherwise (i.e. before, that he knows, or after, that he does not know), we accept his words. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Our Mishnah is like Rebbi. R. Shimon ben Elazar reverses the ages of boys and girls. (We check a girl's vows during the 13th year, and we check a boy's vows during the 12th year.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Rebbi learns from "va'<i>Yiven</i> Hash-m... l'Ishah" -- Hash-m gave women more Binah (understanding) than men.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar expounds this like Reish Lakish;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Va'Yiven Hash-m... va'Yevi'eha El ha'Adam" teaches that Hash-m braided Chavah's hair and brought her to Adam;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(In overseas islands) braiding is called "Benyasa" (building).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> Because a boy learns Torah from his Rebbi, he is quicker to become astute.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PREMATURE HAIRS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the year (when we check, the 12th or 13th for a boy or girl, or vice-versa according to R. Shimon ben Elazar), like the previous years (he is a minor), or like the next year (adulthood)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be regarding vows, for we check them, unlike those of an adult or a younger minor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It determines whether or not we punish (for Aveiros. It also affects Kidushin, divorce, etc... . The case is, he grew (pubic) hairs. Are they Shuma (premature hairs of no significance), or a Siman of adulthood?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav and R. Chaninah):</span> That year is like the year before. (The hairs are Shuma.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan and R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> It is like the next year. (The hairs are Simanim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> A way to remember the opinions is "Zos Lifnim b'Yisrael." ("Zos" is feminine, like the name "Chaninah" (see Bach). R. Chaninah said Lifnei (before).).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (against R. Yochanan - Rav Hamnuna - Mishnah):</span> If he vows <i>after</i> (year 13), even if he says that he did not know that vows and Hekdesh are to Hash-m, it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The (13th) year is like the year before. (We explained that this cannot be regarding vows. It must teach about punishment!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> You consider the Seifa to be extra, and you learn from it. It is just as reasonable to consider the Reisha to be extra, and learn oppositely from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reisha):</span> If he vows before (year 12), even if he says that he knows that vows and Hekdesh are to Hash-m, it does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> That year is like afterwards!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Hamnuna's inference is from the Seifa itself, but not because the Seifa is extra!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The Seifa discusses vowing after the year.) What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he did not grow hairs, he is still a minor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he grew hairs;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The hairs are significant after the year. During the year they would be a Shuma!</p>
