<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>AN <i>ATUM</i> BABY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this point?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zakai):</span> (One is Terefah and cannot live if) part of the thigh (and below) is missing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yanai):</span> The rectum (and below) is missing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> The navel (and below) is missing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Zakai and R. Yanai argue about whether or not a Terefah can live. (R. Yanai holds that Terefos can live, therefore, even more must be missing.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yanai and R. Yochanan (agree that a Terefah can live. They) argue about R. Elazar's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If the thigh and its cavity were removed, it is Nevelah. (R. Yochanan argues with this. He says that it can live unless up to the navel is missing.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> They argue only when the bottom is Atum. If any amount is Atum at the top (of the skull), all agree that the mother is Tehorah (not a Yoledes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal citing R. Yochanan):</span> If any amount is Atum at the top of the skull, the mother is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal citing R. Yochanan):</span> If a baby resembles a date tree (the arms and legs branch off from the shoulders), the mother is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> If a baby's face was Musmasin (slightly mashed) from birth, the mother is Teme'ah (Yoledes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> She is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> If a woman miscarried a hand or foot with delineated fingers or toes, she is Teme'ah. We are not concerned lest it came from an Atum body;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Reish Lakish, it should say "we are not concerned lest the baby was Atum or that its face was Musmasin"! (Ramban - Musmasin is more common than Atum. Ran - if the baby was Atum, surely the face was Musmasin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Papi):</span> R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish agree that if the face was Musmasin, the mother is Teme'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue when the face is totally flat. R. Yochanan is <i>Metaher</i>, and Reish Lakish is <i>Metamei</i>.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reish Lakish should challenge R. Yochanan from the Beraisa. It is concerned only for an Atum baby, but not for a flat face!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan would answer that a flat face is considered Atum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya's sons:</span> When we went to Karyasa, a baby had been born with a flat face. We told them that the mother is a Yoledes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> Go retract your ruling!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps you think that you were stringent (to be Metamei her). Your stringency leads to a leniency (Dam Tohar)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SHESU'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a woman miscarried a baby with two backs and two spines, it is not a child. If an animal miscarried such a creature, one may not eat it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Such a (human) baby is a child. Such an animal is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They argue about Rav Chanin's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanin):</span> "(Es Zeh Lo Sochlu... ) ha'Shesu'ah" is a creature with two backs and two spines.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav understands that it is not a species. Rather, it is a mutation. The Torah forbids such a fetus found inside (the womb of) a slaughtered animal. (All the more so, if it was born, it is a Nevelah, and it cannot be slaughtered);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Shmuel understands that it is a forbidden species (even though it has the Simanim of Kosher animals);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a Shesu'ah fetus (or that of any other Tamei animal) is found inside a (Kosher) slaughtered animal, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav and Shmuel - R. Simi bar Chiya - Beraisa - R. Chanina ben Antignos):</span> An animal with two backs and two spines is blemished. (It is Pasul for a Korban.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is necessary to teach this only if such animals live! (Rashi - this is difficult also for Shmuel. He forbids eating such animals if they were born.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Tam):</span> Shmuel (agrees that it is not a species. He) says that the Torah forbids it if it was born, but if it is found inside a slaughtered animal, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - R. Simi - Mishnah - R. Chanina):</span> A Kohen with two backs and two spines is blemished. (He may not do Avodah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is necessary to teach this only if such a child can live! (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> The Mishnah discusses a bent back. It merely looks like two backs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> The following fetuses are forbidden (if they are born, they are Nevelos even when alive) -- a small animal born after four months of pregnancy, and a large animal born after eight months, or less than this. This excludes one with two backs and two spines.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One with two backs is forbidden even if it found inside a slaughtered animal! (The Beraisa is inherently difficult. The Reisha forbids after it is born. The Seifa teaches that a Shesu'ah is different. It should discuss the same case. We cannot simply say that it permits a born Shesu'ah, for the Torah forbids this! We suggested that it forbids it even without birth. However, this is difficult, for the Reisha discusses after birth!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav explains as follows. A fetus of four (or eight) months or less is forbidden if it was born, but it is permitted if found inside a slaughtered animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This excludes one with two backs. It is forbidden even if it is found inside a slaughtered animal!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for Shmuel):</span> A fetus of four (or eight) months or less is forbidden if it was born, because it is premature. Had it has a full term pregnancy, it would be permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This excludes one with two backs. Even if it had a full term pregnancy, it is permitted only if it is found inside a slaughtered animal; but if it was born, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos) Suggestion:</span> If a woman miscarried a form in which limbs were not delineated, she should be a Yoledes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Uva'Yom ha'Shmini Yimol Besar Arlaso" -- Tum'as Yoledes does not apply if the baby is not fit to live for eight days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> Append to your Beraisa "or if the baby has with two backs and two spines (she is not a Yoledes)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>A case occurred, and R. Yirmeyah bar Aba wanted to rule like Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> Do you intend to be stringent? Your stringency leads to a leniency, i.e. Dam Tohar!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the Halachah follows Rav (against Shmuel) in Isurim (e.g. everything except for monetary laws), whether he is lenient or stringent.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PREMATURE AND ABNORMAL BIRTHS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A woman can give birth to a viable baby after a pregnancy of nine or seven months. Large animals normally give birth after nine months;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Can also large animals have viable offspring after seven months?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Beraisa):</span> (... A small animal born after four months, and a large animal born after eight,) or less than this (is a Nefel).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "Less than this" refers to a large animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it refers to a small animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Granted, if it refers to a large animal, one might have thought that just like a human seven month baby can live, also a seven month baby of a large animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, there is no need to say that a small animal born after three months cannot live!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and answer to objection):</span> Indeed, this clause discusses a small animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that any pregnancy two months shorter than usual produces viable offspring, like we find regarding people and large animals. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a woman miscarried the form of Lilis (a Shed), she has Tum'as Yoledes. It is a child, just it has wings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> A case occurred in which a woman miscarried the form of Lilis. Chachamim said that she is a Yoledes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A woman miscarried the form of a snake. Chanina the nephew of R. Yehoshua ruled that she is a Yoledes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Gamliel heard about this. he told R. Yehoshua to bring Chanina.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chanina's daughter-in-law came to greet him (R. Yehoshua). She asked about a woman who miscarries the form of a snake.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> She is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina's daughter-in-law:</span> I heard in your name that she is a Yoledes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Why did I say that?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">His daughter-in-law:</span> It is because a snake's eyes are round, like human eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>This reminded R. Yehoshua that he himself had taught this. He told R. Gamliel "Chanina ruled like me."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This teaches that a Chacham should always give reasons for his teachings. When he is reminded, he will remember them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MISCARRIAGES WITHOUT THE FORM OF A CHILD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman miscarried a Shefir (the outer skin of a fetus before bones form) full of water, blood or different colors, she is not concerned lest there was a child;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If it was Merukam (it has a human form inside), she is Yoledes male <i>or</i> female. (She adopts the stringencies of both.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If a woman miscarried a Shilya (fetal sac) or Sandal (a fetus that was mashed) she is Yoledes male or female.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Granted, a Shefir full of water or blood is not a child;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if it is full of colors, she should be concerned that there was a fetus, and it dissolved!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> That would happen only if she drank large amounts of undiluted wine. We are not concerned for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah says, the Shefir was <i>full.</i> Had a fetus dissolved there, the Shefir would not be full.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> Had a fetus dissolved there, it would all be one color.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Sha'ul):</span> I used to bury Mesim. I would look at their bones;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If someone used to drink undiluted wine, or drank more than (is proper for the amount) he ate, his bones would appear burned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he drank over-diluted wine, or ate more than (is proper for the amount) he drank, his bones would be black. (Some say that they would be dry, without marrow);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he drank properly diluted wine, and ate the proper amount (for the amount he drank), his bones would be smooth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Sha'ul):</span> I used to bury Mesim. Once, I saw a deer. I chased after it three Parsa'os (about 12 kilometers) inside a (giant) thigh bone. I did not catch it, and I did not reach the end of the bone. (Maharsha - this is a metaphor for his attempt to escape Tum'ah and attain Kedushah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>People told me that it was a bone of Og, king of Bashan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Sha'ul):</span> I used to bury Mesim. Once, the floor of the cave (in which the coffins are inserted) collapsed. I fell into the eyesocket of a Mes. My nose reached the top;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>People told me that it was the eyesocket of Avshalom. (Maharsha - this represents the Tum'ah of seeking something not proper for him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Aba Sha'ul was a midget.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Each of the following was the tallest of his generation, and each reached up only to the shoulder of the previous one:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Aba Sha'ul, R. Tarfon, R. Meir, Rebbi, R. Chiya, Rav, Rav Yehudah, and Ada (the servant of Rabanan);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Prashtavina (Rashi - a man's name; Rashbam - an official) of Pumbedisa was half as tall as Ada, and everyone else reached up only to Prashtavina's hips.</p>
