<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CAN A <i>YOTZEI DOFEN</i> BE A KORBAN? (Cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Culmination of support:</span> R. Shimon said that we may not offer a Yotzei Dofen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He refers to a Yotzei Dofen of (any) Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Nasan):</span> No, he refers only to a Yotzei Dofen Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rebuttal (of rejection, and defense of suggestion):</span> We know that Yotzei Dofen does not have Kedushas Bechor because it is not "Peter Rechem"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Likewise, we should not need "Zos" to invalidate Yotzei Dofen of other Kodshim, for we learn from Bechor! (It says "Imo" regarding both of these.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Kodshim, we need two verses. One must teach about a Yotzei Dofen that was made Hekdesh, and one must teach about a Yotzei Dofen born from a Kodesh mother;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(R. Shimon holds that the child of a Korban does not become Hekdesh until it is born. Rashi deletes this from the text, for all the more so, if he held that it becomes Kodesh from conception, we would need a second verse! Tosfos defends the text. The Gemara teaches that even so, a second verse is needed. Since the Pesul of Yotzei Dofen does not precede the Kedushah, rather, it comes at the same time, one might have thought that it is a valid Korban.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A second verse would not be needed to teach about Bechor. It is always Kodesh from birth, and "Peter Rechem" excludes a Yotzei Dofen!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> The Beraisa says that "Zos" excludes Rove'a, Nirva... , even though other verses disqualify them!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Min ha'Behemah" excludes Rove'a and Nirva. "Min ha'Bakar" excludes a Ne'evad. "Min ha'Tzon" excludes a Muktzeh. "<i>U</i>'Min ha'Tzon" excludes an animal that killed a person.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"Shor" excludes a crossbreed. "Oh Ez" excludes an animal of a different species than its parents.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>We must say that these latter verses disqualify a Rove'a, Nirva, Ne'evad,... of Chulin that was Hukdash. "Zos" disqualifies a Korban that was Rove'a, Nirva, Ne'evad...</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>Likewise, two verses teach about Yotzei Dofen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman saw blood amidst Koshi for three days and gave birth Yotzei Dofen, she is a Zavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says, she is not a Zavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If blood came out from there, it is Tamei (like Dam Nidah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon says, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand the first argument. R. Shimon considers it a birth, therefore the law of Koshi applies. Chachamim do not consider it a birth, so she is a regular Zavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, what is the second argument?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> The case is, the child was born Yotzei Dofen. Blood came out from the Rechem;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon holds that she is a Yoledes. Dam Zivah amidst Koshi is Tahor (like R. Yitzchak, 36b);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that she is not a Yoledes. It is regular Dam Zivah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> If so, there was no need for the Beraisa to teach the second argument. It follows from the first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> "If blood came out from <i>there</i>" connotes from the same place that the child left!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> The case is, the child and blood both came out from the Dofen (the wall of the womb that was cut). They argue about whether or not Makom Makor Tamei (if the Makor is Metamei any blood that touches it, even if the blood will not leave through the Rechem - Rashi. Ramban - the Torah decreed that blood from the Makor is Tamei, but not because it touched it. Blood is not a Mashkeh (and even if it were, only a Revi'is would be Mekabel Tum'ah), and Beis ha'Starim is not Metamei. Tosfos - the Tum'ah is a tradition handed down to Moshe from Sinai.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Chachamim are Metamei the blood. They are also Metamei her. (The blood makes her a Nidah, even though it left through the Dofen);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon is Metaher the blood. He is Metaher her (Tosfos - if the blood came b'Koshi in Yemei Zivah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even Chachamim are Metaher her. (All agree that blood that leaves through the Dofen is not Metamei her);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Shimon taught (and Chachamim agree) that a woman does not become a Nidah (or Zavah) unless the blood leaves through her Ervah -- "Ishah Davah... Ervasah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If a piece of flesh left a woman's Makor, she is Teme'ah -- "Hishafech Nechushtech va'Tigaleh Ervasech." (Something that falls from her bottom is considered to be in its place, i.e. to be Metamei her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Tum'ah does she receive?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tum'ah of seven days is due only to blood, but not to flesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She has Tum'as Erev. (She is Teme'ah until she immerses. She becomes fully Tehorah at night.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If two drops of white blood left the Makor, she is Teme'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Tum'ah does she receive?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Only five colors of blood are Metamei for seven days! (White is not one of them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She has Tum'as Erev (because they came from the Makor);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if two drops left, but if only one left, we attribute it to the walls of the Prozdor.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS THE <i>BEIS HA'CHITZON</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman becomes Teme'ah when blood (leaves the Makor and) enters the Beis ha'Chitzon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Beis ha'Chitzon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> It is the place visible when a girl sits. (The Rechem opens a bit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yochanan):</span> That is considered exposed! (If a Sheretz touched her there, it would be Metamei her. It is not Tum'as Beis ha'Starim (a covered place). The Torah would not call it "bi'Vesarah")!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is the place between the "teeth" (protrusions where the Rechem meets the Prozdor).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If blood went between the "teeth," is this like entering the Prozdor, or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Zakai):</span> She is not Tamei until blood passes between the teeth. Between the teeth is like inside the Rechem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> It is the place of Dishah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is where the Ever rubs against the walls of the Prozdor.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN IS SEMEN <i>METAMEI</i> A WOMAN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "Bi'Vesarah" teaches that she is Teme'ah even though the blood is still inside her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This verse discusses Nidah. What is the source regarding a Zavah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "<i>Zavah</i> bi'Vesarah." (Even though this is in the Parshah of Nidah, this word alludes to Zivah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source regarding a woman who discharges (a man's) semen (that had entered her Makor, and it goes to the Beis ha'Chitzon)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Yihyeh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Shimon says, semen is not Metamei her more than it is Metamei a man;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Semen is not Metamei a man until it leaves his body. Likewise, it is not Metamei her until it leaves her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere, R. Shimon holds that semen is Metamei a woman more than it is Metamei a man!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Shimon) Question:</span> What do we learn from "(if a man has Bi'ah with a woman... ) v'Rachatzu va'Mayim v'Tam'u Ad ha'Arev"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It need not teach that semen  is Metamei what it touches. We know this from "Oh Ish"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Without this verse, the semen would not be Metamei her, for it touches her internally. It is Tum'as Beis ha'Starim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Torah decrees that she becomes Teme'ah anyway.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon expounds that semen <i>during Bi'ah</i> is Metamei her, even though it is Tum'as Beis ha'Starim, but semen that she discharges is not Metamei her (in Beis ha'Chitzon, rather,) until it leaves her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Shimon (in Beraisa #1) say that the discharge of semen is Metamei her? Even without this, she is Teme'ah due to Bi'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she immersed after Bi'ah. The discharge of semen is Metamei her again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> (Tevilah helps until she discharges semen, i.e.) after Tevilah she has only Tum'as Erev. (At night she is Tehorah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava forbids a woman to eat Terumah for three days after Bi'ah, for surely she will discharge semen! (After three days, semen putrefies and loses its Tum'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa discusses a woman who was carried to the Mikveh on her bed. (She was horizontal the entire time, so we are not concerned for a discharge of semen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This implies that Rava discusses a woman who walked to the Mikveh. We should assume that this caused all the semen to leave!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we are concerned that some semen remained.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, Rava should have said "<i>perhaps</i> semen remained (and she will discharge it)"!</p>
