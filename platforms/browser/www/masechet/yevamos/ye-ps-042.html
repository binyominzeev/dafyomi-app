<p class="dedicationbox">12th CYCLE DEDICATIONS<BR>&nbsp;<BR>YEVAMOS 42 (28 Sivan) - dedicated in memory of Hagaon Rav Yisroel Zev [ben Avrohom Tzvi] Gustman ZT'L (author of "Kuntresei Shi'urim" and renowned Dayan of pre-war Vilna) on his Yahrzeit, by a student who merited to study under him. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE WAITING PERIOD BEFORE REMARRYING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Yevamah did Chalitzah within three months, she must wait three months. If she did Chalitzah after three months, she need not wait three months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The three months are counted from her husband's death, and not from the day of Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than a Get (according to Rav)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> (We count the three months before a divorcee may remarry) from the giving of the Get (even though they were not secluded from when the Get was written);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> (We count) from the day it was written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If we permit (Yibum three months after death, even though if she is pregnant they transgress Eshes Ach, which is) Chayavei Kerisos, all the more so we permit (a Chalutzah to remarry three months after death, for even if she was pregnant and the Chalitzah was invalid, this is only) Chayavei Lavin! (Tosfos - if we would tell a Chalutzah to be more stringent, people would not listen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Also, all other women... (must wait three months).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We explained why a Yevamah must wait three months. Why must other women wait?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1: (Rav Nachman):</span> "Lihyos Lecha l'Eilokim ul'Zar'acha Acharecha" - we must distinguish between the seed of the first and second husbands (the Shechinah rests only on people who are certain about their lineage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> ... Therefore, a couple that converted must wait three months.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We know that he is the father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need to distinguish whether the baby was conceived before or after conversion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (d) - Rava):</span> We decree lest a man marry his paternal sister (if he thinks that he is from the other father), do Yibum with the wife of his maternal brother (if he thinks that he is a full brother), lest his mother think that she is exempt from Yibum and Chalitzah (if she thinks that he is the son of the deceased), and lest his Yevamah remarry without Yibum or Chalitzah (if she thinks that her husband had no brother).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chananyah - Beraisa):</span> All the decrees that a Yevamah must wait three months are because of Ervah. This decree (others must within three months) is to fix the child.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rava, all are because of Ervah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This decree is to fix the child, lest he marry Ervah. (Regarding a Yevamah, also she and her Yavam or new husband might transgress Ervah if they do not wait.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IDENTIFYING THE FATHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, it does not help to wait two months. If a baby is born seven months later, we will not know if it is a nine-month baby from the first husband, or a seven-month baby from the second. However, it should be permitted to marry after one month!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a baby is born after seven months, it must be from the second husband. If a baby is born after eight months, it must be a nine-month baby from the first husband (an eight-month baby is always a Nefel)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even if it is born after eight months, it could be a seven-month baby (i.e. it developed fully in seven months) from the second husband that delayed a month before being born.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> She should be permitted to marry after two and a half months!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a baby is born after seven months, it must be from the second husband!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a baby is born after six and a half months, it must be a nine-month baby from the first husband, for a six and a half-month baby from the second husband would not live!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, a six and a half-month baby from the second husband could live;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> Even the opinion that says that a nine-month baby is always born after nine full months agrees that a seven-month baby may be born during the seventh month.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Va'Yhi li'Skufas ha'Yamim (and Chanah gave birth)" - 'Tekufos' means at least two (seasons, six months in all) and 'days' means at least two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should permit her after a very short wait, and check if she is pregnant after three months!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Safra):</span> We do not check if a married woman is pregnant, lest she be disgraced in the eyes of her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can check her footprints (a pregnant woman sinks deeper into loose dirt. This is no disgrace!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> She will walk specially to cover up the pregnancy, in order that her son inherit her new husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we permit her when we know that she is pregnant?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Reuven may not marry a woman pregnant from Shimon or nursing a baby from Shimon. If he did, he must divorce her and may never remarry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This is a decree lest the fetus get mashed (due to the semen or another pregnancy - see 12b).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This concern applies equally to Bi'ah with one's wife when she is pregnant from him (yet this is permitted)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One opinion says that they use a wad. The other says that (they do nothing different, and) Hash-m will have mercy. These apply also when she is pregnant from a different man!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, we are concerned that Bi'ah will harm the fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The same concern applies when she is pregnant from him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Then, a man is careful because he cares about the fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also here he cares about the fetus (he does not want to kill it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, a pregnant woman needs to nurse the baby after it is born. If she becomes pregnant, her milk will cease and the baby will starve.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The same applies when she is pregnant from him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She will feed him eggs and milk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> She will do the same even if it is not his child!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Her husband will not give her money for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> She can demand money for this from the heirs of her first husband!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> A woman is embarrassed to come to Beis Din. She will (passively) kill her son.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE FINAL RULING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This is whether or not she is a virgin... (whether she was previously Mekudeshes or Nesu'ah...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> These are synonymous! (Why does the Mishnah say both?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah explains itself. She must wait whether or not she is a virgin, i.e. whether she was widowed or divorced from Kidushin or Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Elazar did not go to the Beis Medrash. He asked Rav Asi what was taught there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Asi:</span> R. Yochanan ruled like R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> Does this mean that a lone opinion disagrees with him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Asi:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A woman must wait three months before remarrying, (even) in the following cases (even though she did not become pregnant recently): she was constantly going to her father's home (and was there a while before he died), or was quarreling with her husband (and they did not have relations);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Her husband was imprisoned, or too old to have children, or sick;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>She was sick, or miscarried after her husband died, or her womb was uprooted;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>She was too old to have children, or a minor, or an Ailonis, or sterile.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah (some texts - R. Yosi) permits her to marry immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> R. Yochanan retracted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If he retracted, it was due to the following Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Berokah):</span> Chachamim in Kerem b'Yavneh require all to wait three months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Did R. Yochanan really say that the Halachah follows R. Yosi? R. Yochanan said that the Halachah follows a Stam (anonymous) Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any woman may not get married or Mekudeshes for three months, whether or not she is a virgin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> This is a poor question! This Stam Mishnah is followed by a Machlokes (R. Yehudah and R. Yosi argue with the first Stam Tana). In such a case, the Halachah is not (necessarily) like the Stam Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa or R. Yochanan):</span> If there is a Machlokes and later a Stam Mishnah, the Halachah follows the Stam. If the Stam precedes the Machlokes, the Halachah is not (necessarily) like the Stam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Nachum):</span> If a Machlokes is followed by a Stam, how do we rule?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> The Halachah follows the Stam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Nachum):</span> What if the Stam precedes the argument?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> The Halachah is not (necessarily) like the Stam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Nachum):</span> If there is a Stam Mishnah and a Machlokes in a Beraisa, how do we rule?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> The Halachah follows the Stam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Nachum):</span> If there is a Machlokes in the Mishnah and a Stam Beraisa, how do we rule?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> If Rebbi (who wrote the Mishnah) did not decide the law, how could R. Chiya (his Talmid, who codified Beraisos) decide?!</p>
