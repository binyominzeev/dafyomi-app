<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>STRINGENCIES OF <i>MA'ASER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May an Arel eat Ma'aser (Sheni)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like we learn from Ma'aser to Pesach that an Onen may not eat, we learn from Pesach to Ma'aser that an Arel may not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps we can learn what is stringent (Pesach) from what is lenient (Ma'aser), but not vice-versa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes - Mishnah):</span> The following apply to Terumah and Bikurim (the first fruits to ripen, one brings them to a Kohen in the Mikdash), but not to Ma'aser:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One is Chayav Misah b'Yedei Shamayim for eating them (b'Tum'ah), a Zar who ate them b'Shogeg must pay an extra fifth for them, they are forbidden to a Zar, they are the property of the Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They become Batel (nullified) if mixed with 100 times as much Chulin (regular food), one must wash his hands before touching them, and a Tevul Yom must wait until dark to eat them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If an Arel were permitted to eat Ma'aser, the Mishnah should also say that an Arel may not eat Terumah and Bikurim, but he may eat Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Tana omitted teaching this. (Other answers to Question (a) are given on Daf 74.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Surely, the Tana would not omit only one case.) What else did he omit?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He omitted a case in the Seifa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> The following apply to Ma'aser and Bikurim, but not to Terumah: one must bring them to Yerushalayim, one must recite Viduy over them, and they are forbidden to an Onen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon permits [Bikurim] to an Onen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Bi'ur applies to them (there is a deadline, after which one must get rid of them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The Mishnah does not say that they may not be burned if they are Tamei, and that one is lashed for eating them if they are Tamei, which do not apply to Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">73b----------------------------------------73b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>This shows that the Tana omitted cases. (A second answer will be brought at the end of this Daf.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ma'aser and Bikurim are forbidden to an Onen; R. Shimon permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's source to forbid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "In your city you may not eat Ma'aser... u'Serumas Yadecha";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learned that "u'Serumas Yadecha" is Bikurim; the verse equates them to Ma'aser. Just like Ma'aser is forbidden to an Onen, also Bikurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon explains that the Torah calls them Terumah to teach that just like Terumah is permitted to an Onen, also Bikurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They require Bi'ur; R. Shimon exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim equate Bikurim to Ma'aser, and R. Shimon does not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS PERMITTED <i>B'TUM'AH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that one may not burn Tamei Ma'aser, and one is lashed for eating it. What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> "I did not consume (Ma'aser) in Tum'ah" - whether I was Tamei and it was Tahor, or vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimon):</span> (He must declare that he did not eat it b'Tum'ah.) Where does the Torah forbid this?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "He will not eat from the Kodoshim until he immerses" forbids a Tamei to eat Ma'aser! (It cannot refer to Terumah or Kodshim, for it permits right after immersing, before nightfall.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon asks where the Torah forbids eating Ma'aser when it is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon):</span> It says "In your city you <i>may not</i> eat Ma'aser...", and "In your city you <i>may</i> eat them (blemished Korbanos that were redeemed), a Tahor and a Tamei together";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> The Tahor and Tamei may eat in the same plate (even though the food becomes Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>What is permitted (eating when the food is Tamei) there (blemished Korbanos after redemption) is  forbidden regarding Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that these do not apply to Terumah. What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> We learn from "I did not eradicate <i>it</i> in Tum'ah". You may not burn Tamei Ma'aser, but you may burn Tamei Terumah oil. <span class="note">(<span class="notewd">Note:</span> in this discussion, we always discuss burning to benefit from it.)</span></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps you may not burn Tamei Ma'aser, but you may burn Tamei Kodesh oil!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Kal va'Chomer refutes this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ma'aser is lenient, yet it may not be burned b'Tum'ah, and all the more so Kodesh, which is stringent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the same applies to Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "It" permits burning Tamei Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "it" permits burning Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is unreasonable, for Kodesh is stringent:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It can become Pigul (if it was offered with intent to eat it after the allotted time);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It becomes Nosar if not eaten in the allotted time;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It is brought in the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One transgresses Me'ilah for improper benefit from Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>A Tamei who eats it is Chayav Kares;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>It is forbidden to an Onen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should not permit burning Tamei Terumah, since it has stringencies:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Tamei who eats it is Chayav Misah (b'Yedei Shamayim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Zar ate it b'Shogeg he pays for it and adds a fifth;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It cannot be redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>It is forbidden to a Zar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There are more stringencies of Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Even without this Kares is more severe (it overrides the stringencies of Terumah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>We said that one is lashed for eating Tamei Ma'aser or Bikurim, but not for Tamei Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that he is not lashed, but it is forbidden. What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "In your city you will eat <i>it</i>" - this (a redeemed blemished Korban), but not something else (Tamei Terumah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Lav derived from an Aseh is like an Aseh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question 1:f - Rav Ashi):</span> The Tana also omitted cases in the Reisha!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He omitted that Terumah and Bikurim apply in other years (the third and sixth years of Shemitah) and have no redemption, which do not apply to Ma'aser (Sheni).</p>
