<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MARRIAGE OF DEAF PEOPLE AND A MINOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why may a girl married mid'Rabanan to a Kohen eat Terumah, but a Chereshes may not?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yochanan ben Gudgada testified that if a man married off his Chereshes daughter she may be divorced, and that a minor married (mid'Rabanan) to a Kohen eats Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A Chereshes does not eat Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decree to forbid, lest a Chereshes married to a Cheresh (Kohen) eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why shouldn't she eat? We need not stop a minor (or a Chereshes, who is also exempt from Mitzvos) from eating forbidden food!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We forbid a Chereshes married to a Cheresh lest a Pikachas married to a Cheresh eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since she is married mid'Rabanan, she should be permitted to eat Terumah mid'Rabanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decree lest she eat Terumah mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does a minor have a Kesuvah, but a Chereshes does not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If a Chereshes had a Kesuvah, no man would marry her;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a minor has a Kesuvah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> The following have no Kesuvah: one who did Mi'un, a Sheniyah, and an Ailonis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If a minor was divorced, she would have a Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Chereshes has no Kesuvah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a Cheresh or lunatic married a Pikachas, even if he became healthy, she has no claim against him. If he wants to remain with her, she has a Kesuvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Pike'ach married a Chereshes or lunatic, even if he wrote her a Kesuvah of 10000 Zuz it is valid, because he chose to give away his property.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is only because he chose to give. If not, she has no Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is because if she had a Kesuvah, no man would marry her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should enact a Kesuvah for a Pikachas who marries a Cheresh. If not, women will not marry deaf men!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Women (will marry in any case, for they) are more eager to marry than men are.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Rav Malkiyo married off a Cheresh to a woman; he wrote her a Kesuvah of 400 Zuz from the man's property.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> This was very smart! If the man wanted a slave to serve him, we would buy one for him. Now, he also gets a wife!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A DEAF PERSON'S OBLIGATION IN MITZVOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Shmuel):</span> If another man had Bi'ah with a Cheresh's wife, (we do not consider her a Safek Eshes Ish, so) he does not bring an Asham Taluy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> There are five types of people cannot separate Terumah, even b'Di'eved: a Cheresh, a lunatic, a minor, one who does not own the produce, and a Nochri who separated a Yisrael's produce, even with permission.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shmuel holds like R. Elazar (who considers a Cheresh to be a Safek Pike'ach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> If a Cheresh separated Terumah, one may not treat it like Chulin, because he is a Safek (Pike'ach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Shmuel holds like R. Elazar, he should obligate an Asham Taluy!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (He holds that) one brings an Asham Taluy only for a Safek based on two objects (one of which was Vadai forbidden).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar does not require that there were two objects!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> One must bring an Asham Taluy for eating Chelev of a Koy (a Safek Behemah, Safek Chayah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel holds like R. Elazar regarding a Cheresh, but not regarding Asham Taluy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Shmuel):</span> One brings an Asham Taluy for Bi'ah with a Cheresh's wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Five types of people cannot separate Terumah...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel holds like R. Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> What is R. Elazar's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Does he hold that a Cheresh always has the same weak Da'as (understanding), and he is unsure whether or not his Da'as is clear?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">113b----------------------------------------113b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, is he sure that his Da'as is weak and (normally) unclear, but at times it is clear?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make what his reason is?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It determines whether or not he may divorce his wife;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he is always the same, his Get is as valid as his Kidushin!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If he alternatives, he can Mekadesh but cannot divorce (we must be concerned lest his Da'as was clear at the time of Kidushin, but unclear when he divorced)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AN INSANE WOMAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she went insane...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Mid'Oraisa, a man can divorce a lunatic; just like a Pikachas is divorced against her will.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim said that she may not be divorced, lest she be treated like Hefker.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If she can guard her Get and herself, she will not be like Hefker!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If she cannot guard her Get nor herself, she cannot be divorced mid'Oraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(D'Vei R. Yanai):</span> "V'Nasan b'Yadah (he will put a Get in her hand)" discusses a woman who has a Yad (power of acquisition) to accept divorce herself;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>A lunatic has no such Yad!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "He will send her from his house" discusses a wife who is expelled and does not return.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>A lunatic will return to him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she can guard her Get but not herself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mid'Oraisa, she can be divorced, since she can guard her Get;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Mid'Rabanan she may not be divorced, lest she be like Hefker.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If she went insane, he may not divorce her. If he went insane, he may <i>never</i> divorce her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>'Never' connotes that this is mid'Oraisa. When she went insane, it is only mid'Rabanan (that he cannot divorce her).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>DIVORCE OF DEAF PEOPLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yochanan ben Nuri) Question:</span> (Why do we say that if she goes deaf he may divorce her, but if he goes deaf he cannot?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was the case of a man (who went deaf) clear to R. Yochanan ben Nuri, and he was unsure about a woman (who went deaf)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Or, was the case of a woman clear, and he was unsure about a man?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> A man who divorces is unlike a woman who is divorced. A woman is divorced willingly or unwillingly, and a man divorces only willingly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that R. Yochanan ben Nuri was unsure about a man.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> To the contrary! Since they (brought R. Yochanan ben Gudgada's testimony, and) said 'Also she has the same law', this shows that R. Yochanan ben Nuri was unsure about a woman!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Yochanan ben Nuri (had no doubt. He) addressed Chachamim according to their reasoning;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>I hold that just like a deaf man cannot divorce, a Chereshes cannot be divorced. Why do you distinguish?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They answered that a man who divorces is unlike a woman who is divorced...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yochanan ben Gudgada testified (that a Chereshes married mid'Oraisa may be divorced).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This teaches that if a man tells witnesses 'watch me give this Get', and tells his wife (before giving it) 'take this loan document', she is divorced.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan ben Gudgada taught that divorce works even if she has no understanding. The same applies here!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since he said 'take this loan document', he invalidated the Get. R. Yochanan teaches that this is not so;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had he invalidated it, he would have told the witnesses. Since he did not tell them, it is still valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He deceived his wife to spare himself shame.</p></div>
