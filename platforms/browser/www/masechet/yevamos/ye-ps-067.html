<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TZON BARZEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If she brought in two vessels worth 1000 Zuz, and they increased in value to 2000, she takes one for her Kesuvah (the dowry she brought in). She may pay the value of the other and take it also, due to glory of her father's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he teach that what she brought from her father's house is hers? We already know this from his earlier teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Above he discussed when her Kesuvah entitles her to take it all. One might have thought that she may not pay money to retrieve her Kelim. Rav Yehudah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EATING <i>TERUMAH</i> AFTER THE MARRIAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> If a Bas Yisrael was widowed from a Kohen and she was pregnant, her slaves do not eat Terumah because the fetus owns part of them. A fetus forbids from eating, but does not permit eating;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> According to you, this should apply even if she is a Bas Kohen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is R. Yosi's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he hold that a fetus in the womb of a Zarah (non-Kohenes) is a Zar?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does he hold that only one who is born permits others to eat Terumah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The law of slaves of a pregnant Kohenes depends on this. (They eat only according to the first explanation.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> He holds that a fetus in the womb of a Zarah is a Zar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> He holds that only one who is born permits others to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> You forbid a pregnant Bas Yisrael widowed from a Kohen. What do you say about a Bas Kohen widowed from a Kohen?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> I did not hear that law [that she is forbidden; she is permitted]. I only heard the law I said.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We understand this if he forbids because a fetus in a Zarah's womb is a Zar. However, if he holds that only one who is born permits others to eat, why did he say that he did not hear about this? It is the same law!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> This is R. Yosi's opinion. Chachamim say, if the Kohen left sons, her slaves eat due to his sons. If he left no sons, they eat due to his brothers. If he left no brothers, they eat due to the whole family.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> '<i>This</i> (is R. Yosi's opinion)' implies that Shmuel himself disagrees;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, Shmuel told Rav Chanah 'gather a Minyan, and I will teach that an acquisition on behalf of a fetus is valid'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, this (is R. Yosi's opinion), and Shmuel agrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Shmuel's Chidush that Chachamim argue with R. Yosi? They do not argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zakai):</span> R. Yosi gave this testimony in the name of Shemayah and Avtalyon, and Chachamim admitted to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It does not say that they accepted it. They admitted that it is reasonable.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO DIED WITH CHILDREN AND A PREGNANT WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> If he (died and) left sons, both types of slaves eat. If he left her pregnant, neither type eats. If he left sons and she was pregnant, Melug slaves eat like she does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Tzon Barzel slaves do not eat, because the fetus owns a share, and a fetus forbids eating, but does not permit;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yishmael bar R. Yosi says in the name of R. Yosi, a daughter permits them to eat, but a son does not permit them to eat;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon says, if he left sons, both types of slaves eat. If he left daughters, they do not eat, lest the fetus is a male, and daughters do not inherit when there is a son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Shimon say "lest the fetus is a male"? Even if it is a female, they do not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> True! R. Shimon covers both cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is a female, she also disqualifies them from eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is a male, the daughters do not inherit at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Shimon permit when he left sons? The fetus owns a share!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">67b----------------------------------------67b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He is not concerned for the minority (that the fetus is a viable male. Half of all fetuses are male, and some of them are Nefalim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, he is concerned for a minority, but we fix things like Rav Nachman. (We give other property to the fetus (on condition that he is a male) so he has no share in the slaves.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> When orphans come to divide their father's estate, Beis Din appoints an overseer, who picks for them a nice share. When they grow up, they can protest;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Nachman himself holds that they cannot protest. If they could protest, there is no strength to the enactment of Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about whether we make an enactment like Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree to it. They argue about whether or not we are concerned for a minority (when the enactment was not done).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael citing R. Yosi):</span> A daughter permits them to eat. A son does not permit them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, a son does not permit them due to the fetus' share. The same should apply when he left a daughter!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The case is, the estate is small (no more than what the daughter will eat until she matures), and there is a son with the daughter. In either case, the fetus has no share:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is a male, it is no better than the son (who does not inherit);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is a female, a daughter eats due to Rabbinic enactment, and there is no enactment before she is born!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Seifa - R. Shimon):</span> (When he left daughters) the slaves do not eat lest the fetus is a male, and daughters do not inherit when there is a son.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This cannot discuss a small estate, for then it goes to the daughters!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa discusses a large estate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A small estate is not in the daughters' Reshus (even though all the money will be used for their food)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> If (male) orphans sold property from a small estate, the sale stands!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, R. Yishmael says that a <i>daughter</i> permits the slaves to eat, i.e. the mother (permits her Melug slaves).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yosi taught that!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means that also R. Yishmael bar R. Yosi says so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PEOPLE WHO ONLY DISQUALIFY FROM EATING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A fetus, a Yavam, Kidushin, a deaf man, and a nine-year old disqualify but do not permit to eat (This and the coming clause are explained below);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In the following cases the widow does Chalitzah but not Yibum - we are in doubt whether or not a boy is nine years old, or whether or not a boy brought two hairs, or if a house fell on a man and his brother's daughter and we do not know who died first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> A fetus disqualifies a Bas Kohen widowed or divorced from a Yisrael - "Bi'N'ureha (she returns to eat Terumah)" excludes a pregnant woman;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If she is a Bas Yisrael widowed from a Kohen, a fetus does not permit her to eat. Only one who is born permits eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A Yavam disqualifies a Bas Kohen widowed or divorced from a Yisrael - "She will return to her father's house (ki'Ne'ureha" - Rashi) excludes a Shomeres Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A Yavam does not permit a Bas Yisrael widowed or divorced from a Kohen. "Kinyan <i>Kaspo</i> Hu Yochal Bo", but she was acquired by the Yavam's brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A Bas Kohen Mekudeshes to a Yisrael is disqualified from eating, since he acquired her.</p>
