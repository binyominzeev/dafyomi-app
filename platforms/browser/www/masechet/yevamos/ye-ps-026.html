<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TIMES WHEN WE ARE NOT CONCERNED FOR SUSPICION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In all these cases (when Reuven may not marry Leah because he permitted her to marry), if he had a wife and she died, he may then marry Leah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Leah married someone else and was widowed or divorced, Reuven may then marry her;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>In all cases, Leah is permitted to Reuven's children and brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> This is only if Reuven's wife died, but not if he divorced her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Hillel - Beraisa):</span> It is even if he divorced her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> Reuven may marry Leah only if he had previously quarreled with his wife (Rashi; Me'iri - only if there is a real quarrel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> In both cases, there was no previous quarrel (Rashi; Me'iri - there is a quarrel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven (later) started the quarrel, he may not marry Leah. If his wife started it, he may.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they married...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> This is even when a widowed woman remarried and was widowed again, and a divorced woman was divorced again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike Rebbi, who says that a Chazakah is established after two occurrences (so a woman who was widowed twice may not remarry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It can be like Rebbi. The Mishnah permits a widowed woman who was later divorced, and a divorced woman that was later widowed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They are all permitted to his sons and brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A man suspected of Bi'ah with Rachel may not marry her mother, daughter or sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why is our case different?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Women frequently visit each other (if he marries Rachel's relative, he may come to have Bi'ah with Rachel, and this is Chayavei Kerisus)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Men do not frequently visit each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Women do not forbid each other (if Leah's relative has Bi'ah with Leah's husband, this does not forbid Leah to her husband, therefore a woman is not concerned if her husband has Bi'ah with her relatives;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Men do forbid each other (if Levi's wife has Bi'ah with his relative (or any other man), she becomes forbidden to Levi), so a man distances his wife from his relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the woman should be permitted even to his father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She is! The Mishnah teaches a bigger Chidush:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven permitted a woman, not only his father may marry her, in which case Reuven is ashamed to sin with his father's wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even Reuven's son may marry her. Even though a man is not ashamed to be with his son's wife, we are not concerned.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SISTERS THAT FALL TOGETHER TO <i>YIBUM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two of four brothers were married to sisters, and these two died, the widows do Chalitzah, not Yibum. If they did Yibum, they must be divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer says, Beis Shamai allow them to stay married. Beis Hillel say that they must be divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one of the sisters was an Ervah to (e.g.) Reuven, he is forbidden to her and permitted to her sister. Shimon (the other surviving brother) is forbidden to both;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If a sister is forbidden to a brother due to an Isur Mitzvah or Isur Kedushah, she does Chalitzah but not Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If each sister is Ervah to a different brother, each is permitted to the brother to whom she is not Ervah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This fulfills 'when her sister is her Yevamah, she does Chalitzah or Yibum.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Our Mishnah shows that Yesh Zikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, since the sisters fall from different brothers, each Yavam could do Yibum with one of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Ein Zikah, but it is forbidden to cause that the Mitzvah of Yibum might be lost;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we allowed Yibum, perhaps by the time Reuven does Yibum, Shimon will die, and the other Yevamah (who is now Reuven's Achos Ishto) will be exempt from Yibum and Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even when (at the beginning) there were three brothers, the sisters should do Chalitzah and not Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> True! The Tana taught even more.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there were three brothers, if the surviving brother does Yibum, the Mitzvah of Yibum is perforce Batel regarding her sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When there are four brothers, one might have thought that we are not concerned that one may die and the Mitzvah will be lost. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even when there were five brothers, Yibum should not be allowed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are not concerned lest two (of the three surviving) brothers die.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CHALITZAH PESULAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If three sisters fell to Yibum to two brothers, one sister does Chalitzah with one brother, another does Chalitzah with the other brother, and the third sister needs Chalitzah from both of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Since Rav requires a sister to do Chalitzah with both brothers, he must hold that Yesh Zikah, so the third sister's Chalitzah is Pesulah (Rebbi - since Yibum was forbidden; Tosfos - since the Zikah is weakened), and one who did Chalitzah Pesulah must do Chalitzah with all the brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also the first two sisters should need Chalitzah from all the brothers!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If they fell together (the second fell before the first did Chalitzah), that would be true. The case is, each fell after the previous one (did Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One sister fell, and Reuven did Chalitzah with her. Another sister fell, and Shimon did Chalitzah with her. When the third falls, each does Chalitzah to remove his Zikah to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav (17b) taught that Ein Zikah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here he teaches according to the opinion that Yesh Zikah.</p>
