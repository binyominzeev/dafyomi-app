<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>YIBUM OF MEN OF UNKNOWN FATHERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Due to Safek, a man can (be obligated to) do Chalitzah to his mother, to his sister, and to his daughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Case 1 - his mother:</span> Reuven and Shmuel were born to Leah and Chanah, respectively, and then Leah and Chanah each had another son, and these sons became mixed up. Reuven married Chanah and Shmuel married Leah, and Reuven and Shmuel died without children. Each of the mixed up children does Chalitzah to both women. It turns out that each did Chalitzah to his mother (and his Yevamah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Case 2 - his sister:</span> Reuven was born to Yakov and Leah, and Leah was widowed or divorced and had a daughter from another man. This daughter became mixed up with another girl. Yakov also had two sons from Esther; each of these sons married one of the mixed up girls, and died without children. Reuven does Chalitzah to both girls, one of whom is his sister.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Case 3 - his daughter:</span> Reuven's daughter became mixed with another girl. Reuven's two brothers married the two girls, and died without children. Reuven does Chalitzah to both women, one of whom is his daughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A man and his wife can give birth to children from five different nations:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Yisrael bought a slave couple with two children, and one of them converted, one of their children is a Nochri, and one is a convert;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the parents immersed to become Kanani slaves and had a child, the child is a slave;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the mother was freed and she had conceived through her 'husband', the child is a Mamzer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If the father was freed and they had a child, their five children are a Nochri, convert, slave, Mamzer and Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that the child of a Nochri or slave from a Yisraelis is a Mamzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A man can sell his father to collect his mother's Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The case is, a Yisrael bought a slave couple with a son. The master freed the mother and married her, and gave all his property to her son. The son sells his father to enable his mother to collect her Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Meir. It teaches that even though slaves are Metaltelim, there is a lien on them to pay a Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> (The Beraisa is like Chachamim who argue with R. Meir). It teaches that slaves are like land.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CHILDREN WHO BECAME MIXED UP</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Leah's son was mixed up with her daughter-in-law's son. The children grew up and married women and died. A son of the daughter-in-law does Chalitzah, but not Yibum. The widow is either his brother's wife, or the wife of his father's brother;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A son of Leah does Yibum or Chalitzah. The widow is either his brother's wife, or his nephew's wife (who is permitted).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If a Kosher son died (without children):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Leah's son died, each Safek (mixed-up child) does Chalitzah but not Yibum. The widow is either his brother's wife, or his uncle's wife;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the daughter-in-law's son died, one Safek does Chalitzah, and the other does Yibum (or Chalitzah. The widow is either his brother's wife, or his nephew's wife.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If the son of a Kohen became mixed with his Shifchah's son, both of them may eat Terumah. They receive one share at the granaries;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">99b----------------------------------------99b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>They may not become Tamei Mes. They cannot marry Kosher or Pasul women.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If they grew up and freed each other, the following laws apply to each:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He marries a woman fit for a Kohen;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He may not become Tamei. If he did, he is not lashed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He may not eat Terumah. If he ate, he does not pay the principal, nor an added fifth;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>He does not receive a share of Terumah at the granaries. He sells Terumah that he separates from his own produce, and keeps the money;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>He does not get a share of Kodshim of the Mikdash. We do not give to him Kodshim [to offer. If he comes to offer a Korban], we do not take his [Korban] from him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>He is exempt from giving Matanos (the foreleg, jaw and stomach of a Chulin animal);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>His firstborn animals graze until they get a blemish;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>We put on him the stringencies of a Kohen and of a Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why are the definite children called Kesherim? The ones who are mixed are not illegitimate!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Indeed, it should say 'the definite children.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the daughter-in-law's son died, one Safek does Chalitzah, and the other does Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Chalitzah must be done before Yibum. A Safek cannot do Yibum first, lest he is from the mother-in-law, and they transgress Yevamah l'Shuk (a Shomeres Yavam having Bi'ah with a stranger).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A KOHEN WHO BECAME MIXED UP WITH A SLAVE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen's son became mixed up ...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, they only get Echad (one share) at the granaries!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should say, they get a share only if they are k'Echad' (together). This is like the opinion that we distribute Terumah to a slave only if his master is with him:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> We distribute Terumah to a slave only if his master is with him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, he can say "if I am a Kohen, give for my sake. If I am a slave, give me for my master."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>In R. Yehudah's area, receiving Terumah was grounds to establish a person to have proper lineage (for marriage). In R. Yosi's area, it was not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar bar Tzadok):</span> I only testified once, and they established a slave as a Kohen based on my testimony.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This cannot be! Hash-m does not allow a pitfall to come even through the animals of Tzadikim, all the more so, through Tzadikim themselves!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they sought to establish a slave as a Kohen based on his testimony;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He saw a man receive Terumah in R. Yosi's region, and testified in R. Yehudah's region.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are 10 categories to whom we do not distribute Terumah at the granaries: a deaf person, lunatic or minor; a Tumtum or Androginus; a slave or woman; an Arel or Tamei; and a Kohen married to a Pesulah (a woman forbidden to him).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In every case we send to their houses, except for a Tamei or a Kohen married to a Pesulah.</p></div>
