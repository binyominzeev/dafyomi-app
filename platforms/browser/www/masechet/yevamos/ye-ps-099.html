<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>YIBUM</i> OF MEN OF UNKNOWN FATHERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Due to Safek, a man can (be obligated to) do Chalitzah to his mother, to his sister, and to his daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Case 1 - his mother:</span> Reuven and Shmuel were born to Leah and Chanah, respectively, and then Leah and Chanah each had another son, and these sons became mixed up. Reuven married Chanah and Shmuel married Leah, and Reuven and Shmuel died without children. Each of the mixed up children does Chalitzah to both women. It turns out that each did Chalitzah to his mother (and his Yevamah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Case 2 - his sister:</span> Reuven was born to Yakov and Leah, and Leah was widowed or divorced and had a daughter from another man. This daughter became mixed up with another girl. Yakov also had two sons from Esther; each of these sons married one of the mixed up girls, and died without children. Reuven does Chalitzah to both girls, one of whom is his sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Case 3 - his daughter:</span> Reuven's daughter became mixed with another girl. Reuven's two brothers married the two girls, and died without children. Reuven does Chalitzah to both women, one of whom is his daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A man and his wife can give birth to children from five different nations:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Yisrael bought a slave couple with two children, and one of them converted, one of their children is a Nochri, and one is a convert;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the parents immersed to become Kanani slaves and had a child, the child is a slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the mother was freed and she had conceived through her 'husband', the child is a Mamzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If the father was freed and they had a child, their five children are a Nochri, convert, slave, Mamzer and Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that the child of a Nochri or slave from a Yisraelis is a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A man can sell his father to collect his mother's Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The case is, a Yisrael bought a slave couple with a son. The master freed the mother and married her, and gave all his property to her son. The son sells his father to enable his mother to collect her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Meir. It teaches that even though slaves are Metaltelim, there is a lien on them to pay a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> (The Beraisa is like Chachamim who argue with R. Meir). It teaches that slaves are like land.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHILDREN WHO BECAME MIXED UP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Leah's son was mixed up with her daughter-in-law's son. The children grew up and married women and died. A son of the daughter-in-law does Chalitzah, but not Yibum. The widow is either his brother's wife, or the wife of his father's brother;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A son of Leah does Yibum or Chalitzah. The widow is either his brother's wife, or his nephew's wife (who is permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If a Kosher son died (without children):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Leah's son died, each Safek (mixed-up child) does Chalitzah but not Yibum. The widow is either his brother's wife, or his uncle's wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the daughter-in-law's son died, one Safek does Chalitzah, and the other does Yibum (or Chalitzah. The widow is either his brother's wife, or his nephew's wife.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If the son of a Kohen became mixed with his Shifchah's son, both of them may eat Terumah. They receive one share at the granaries;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">99b----------------------------------------99b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>They may not become Tamei Mes. They cannot marry Kosher or Pasul women.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If they grew up and freed each other, the following laws apply to each:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He marries a woman fit for a Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He may not become Tamei. If he did, he is not lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He may not eat Terumah. If he ate, he does not pay the principal, nor an added fifth;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He does not receive a share of Terumah at the granaries. He sells Terumah that he separates from his own produce, and keeps the money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>He does not get a share of Kodshim of the Mikdash. If he comes to offer a Korban, we do not seize it from him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>He is exempt from giving Matanos (the foreleg, jaw and stomach of a Chulin animal);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>His firstborn animals graze until they get a blemish;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>We put on him the stringencies of a Kohen and of a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why are the definite children called Kesherim? The ones who are mixed are not illegitimate!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Indeed, it should say 'the definite children.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the daughter-in-law's son died, one Safek does Chalitzah, and the other does Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Chalitzah must be done before Yibum. A Safek cannot do Yibum first, lest he is from the mother-in-law, and they transgress Yevamah l'Shuk (a Shomeres Yavam having Bi'ah with a stranger).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>KOHEN</i> WHO BECAME MIXED UP WITH A SLAVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen's son became mixed up ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, they only get Echad (one share) at the granaries!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should say, they get a share only if they are k'Echad' (together). This is like the opinion that we distribute Terumah to a slave only if his master is with him:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> We distribute Terumah to a slave only if his master is with him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, he can say "if I am a Kohen, give for my sake. If I am a slave, give me for my master."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>In R. Yehudah's area, receiving Terumah was grounds to establish a person to have proper lineage (for marriage). In R. Yosi's area, it was not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar bar Tzadok):</span> I only testified once, and they established a slave as a Kohen based on my testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This cannot be! Hash-m does not allow a pitfall to come even through the animals of Tzadikim, all the more so, through Tzadikim themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they sought to establish a slave as a Kohen based on his testimony;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He saw a man receive Terumah in R. Yosi's region, and testified in R. Yehudah's region.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are 10 categories to whom we do not distribute Terumah at the granaries: a deaf person, lunatic or minor; a Tumtum or Androginus; a slave or woman; an Arel or Tamei; and a Kohen married to a Pesulah (a woman forbidden to him).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In every case we send to their houses, except for a Tamei or a Kohen married to a Pesulah.</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
