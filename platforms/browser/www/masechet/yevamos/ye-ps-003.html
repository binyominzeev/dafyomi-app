<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ORDER OF THE <i>MISHNAH</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We must expound to learn about all the Arayos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Granted, we must expound to learn about Yibum (that they are exempt and that they exempt the Tzarah), but the Isur (even not in a situation of Yibum) of the other Arayos is explicit;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Isur of Bito is known only through expounding.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We learn the Isur of Bito through (Gezeirah Shavah,) "Henah-Henah" and "Zimah-Zimah".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Tana prefers what is learned by expounding, the case of Achos Ishto (for which the law of Yibum is most explicit) should be taught last!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once the Tana started listing sisters, he also taught Achos Ishto.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, let him teach sisters at the end!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question 3a, Daf 2b):</span> Rather, we teach the closest relatives first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>First we teach about the Yavam's own relatives, i.e. Bito, his daughter's daughter and his son's daughter;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>After teaching about three generations below him, we teach about three generations below his wife;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>After three generations below his wife, we teach about three generations above his wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>We then teach about his sister and maternal aunt, which are his own relatives.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Once we discuss sisters, we teach about Achos Ishto.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It would have been proper to teach about his daughter-in-law before Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo, since the latter is not forbidden because of her closeness to Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>However, once we list fraternal Isurim, we include Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE EXEMPTION FROM YIBUM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Tana say that she exempts her Tzaros from Yibum and Chalitzah? She forbids her Tzaros!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Had he said that she forbids Yibum, we would have thought that Chalitzah is required.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He could have said that she (also) forbids Chalitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should Chalitzah be forbidden (even if it is not needed)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If we allow Chalitzah (when it is unnecessary and Yibum is permitted), perhaps people will come to do Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Since the Tzarah is forbidden only regarding Yibum, but is permitted when there is no Mitzvah, we taught 'she exempts'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it say that she exempts from Chalitzah and Yibum? It suffices to say that she exempts from Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, we would have thought that she does Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it teaches that whoever is obligated to do Yibum may do Chalitzah (instead), and whoever may not do Yibum does not do Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah should (list the primary Mitzvah first and) say that she exempts from Yibum and Chalitzah. Alternatively, it should just say that she exempts from Chalitzah (and obviously, from Yibum)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is like Aba Sha'ul, who says that Chalitzah is preferable to Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CASES EXCLUDED FROM THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Twice, the Mishnah says that there are 15 cases. What other possibilities does it come to exclude?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It excludes (a Sotah and Ailonis,) the cases of Rav and Rav Asi (Daf 11a and 12a. Our Tana agrees that they do not do Yibum, but he holds that they do not exempt their Tzaros.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav and Rav Asi (who say that they exempt their Tzaros), what two cases are excluded?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If each agrees to the law of his colleague, we exclude the Tzaros of Mema'enes (a Mema'enes) and of Machazir Gerushaso (a woman who transgressed and remarried her ex-husband after marrying someone else in between).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Rav and Rav Asi disagree with each other, each excludes the case of his colleague and Tzaras Mema'enes or Tzaras Machazir Gerushaso.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav and Rav Asi, why didn't the Mishnah list their cases?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is because Tzaras Tzarah does not apply in their cases. (Sotah and Ailonis are forbidden to all the brothers, so their Tzaros cannot do Yibum with any brother.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE SOURCE OF THE LAW OF THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of the law of the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "V'Ishah El Achosah Lo Sikach Litzror (to be a Tzarah) Legalos Ervasah <i>Aleha</i> b'Chayehah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Yevamah Yavo Aleha". One might have thought that this applies to Arayos (i.e. if his brother's wife was related to him in an additional way, e.g. Bito);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Gezeirah Shavah teaches just like "Yevamah Yavo Aleha" discusses Yibum, also the Isurim of Arayos apply even in a case of Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This forbids Yibum with Arayos. How do we know that Yibum with Tzaras Ervah is also forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Litzror" (to include Tzaros).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the Tzarah of the Tzarah is forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Litzror" instead of  'Latzor' (the extra 'Reish' comes to include).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about when the Yevamah is the sister of the Yavam's wife. How do we know that this applies to other Arayos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Achos Ishto is Arayos punishable by Kares (b'Mezid) and Chatas (b'Shogeg) and she may not do Yibum. All such Arayos may not do Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This forbids the Arayos to do Yibum. What is the source to forbid their Tzaros?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Achos Ishto is Ervah punishable by Kares and Chatas, and she and her Tzarah may not do Yibum. The same applies to all such Arayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>This is the source that the 15 cases of the Mishnah exempt the Tzaros, Tzaros of the Tzaros, ad infinitum from Chalitzah and Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the six Arayos (of the Mishnah 13A) which are more stringent should also exempt the Tzaros!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Shimon's Achos Ishto was able to marry his brother. We do not learn to the six Arayos that cannot marry any (paternal) brother of Shimon!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because the law of a Tzarah applies only to co-wives of a brother.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This forbids Yibum. Where do we know the punishment if they do Yibum?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "All that do any of these abominations... (will get Kares)".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>AN ASEH OVERRIDES A LAV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had the Torah not written "Aleha" to forbid Yibum with Achos Ishto, we would permit Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> An Aseh is Docheh (overrides) a Lav. (Additional answers will be given starting on Daf 7a. Answers to Question #1 (below) begin on Daf 5b.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> This applies only to a plain Lav, but not to a Lav punishable by Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> What is the source that an Aseh overrides a plain Lav?</p></div>
