<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ARE CONVERTS PERMITTED TO THEIR RELATIVES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is permitted. Since the Seifa says that they are liable, the Reisha says that they are not liable, for parallel structure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> People say that a Mitzri (Nochri) has no father. This is not because they have Bi'ah wantonly, and we do not know who the father is, but if we would know, we would be concerned;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rather, even when we know, we are not concerned. Twins come from the same drop of semen, just it split into two, and the Beraisa teaches that they do not do Chalitzah or Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the Torah considers the child to have no father - "Their flesh is flesh of donkeys, and their seed is like that of horses".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi said that Niftaim the convert married the wife of Ploni, his maternal brother. Chachamim said that marriage does not apply to a convert.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot say that if he was Mekadesh a woman it does not take effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the Isur of Eshes Ach does not apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, Ploni married her after he converted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he married her before conversion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, obviously she is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we decree due to the case when he married her after conversion. R. Yosi teaches that we do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Ben Yosiyan):</span> I saw a convert who married his maternal brother's wife. I asked who permitted this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The convert:</span> Here are a woman and her seven children that were permitted. R. Akiva sat on this rock and said two things:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A convert may marry the wife of his maternal brother;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"Hash-m's word to Yonah the second time" - He did not speak to him a third time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Beraisa permits the wife of a maternal brother, i.e. whom he married after conversion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he married her before conversion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, obviously she is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we decree due to the case when he married her after conversion. The Beraisa teaches that we do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The convert is not believed to say that R. Akiva permitted this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Chacham says a teaching (that pertains to himself), we accept it only if he already taught it before the case arose.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This case was, he had already said the teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Here he was believed, because the woman and her seven children had already been permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Here he was believed because he said another teaching with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Hash-m's word to Yonah the second time" - He did not speak to him a third time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says, "He (Yarav'am ben Yoash) returned the border... like Hash-m said through Yonah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> He spoke only twice with him regarding Ninveh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> "Like Hash-m said through Yonah", just like Ninveh was reversed from evil to good, also in the days of Yarav'am ben Yoash, Yisrael reversed from evil to good.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>RELATIVES PERMITTED TO A CONVERT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a boy was born after his mother converted, but was conceived beforehand, he is considered a convert. He is forbidden to maternal relatives, but not to paternal relatives;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he married his maternal sister or his father's maternal sister, he must divorce her. If he married his paternal sister or his father's paternal sister, they may stay married;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">98b----------------------------------------98b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he married his mother's maternal sister, he must divorce her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir says, if he married his mother's paternal sister, he must divorce her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says that he must divorce any relative on the mother's side, but he may keep any relative on the father's side.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim say, he may keep her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>He is permitted to the wife of his (maternal - Bach deletes this from the text) brother, and the wife of his father's brother, and all other Arayos are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This includes his father's wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If he (any Nochri) married a woman and her daughter (and later they all converted), he has Nisu'in with one and divorces the other. L'Chatchilah, he should not do Nisu'in (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> If his (any Nochri's) wife dies, he is permitted to his mother-in-law (Nimukei Yosef - even if all three converted before she died);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> If his wife dies, he is forbidden to his mother-in-law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that he is permitted to his brother's wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, his brother married her after conversion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he married her before conversion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, obviously she is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we decree due to the case when he married her after conversion. The Beraisa teaches that we do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he married a woman and her daughter, he has Nisu'in with one and divorces the other. L'Chatchilah, he should not do Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If he must divorce her, of course l'Chatchilah he may not do Nisu'in!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The last clause refers to the cases in which he may keep her. L'Chatchilah, he should not do Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Version #1:</span> If his wife dies, he is permitted to his mother-in-law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> He is forbidden to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The latter version is like R. Yishmael, who says that the Isur of a mother-in-law is the same after the wife dies. Chachamim decree regarding a convert;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The former version is like R. Akiva, who says that the Isur becomes lighter after the wife dies. Chachamim did not decree regarding a convert.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CHILDREN WHO BECAME MIXED UP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The children of five women got mixed up. These children grew up and married women. One of the men died without children. There is a five-way doubt about who is his father. A (definite) son from each of four of the five possible fathers does Chalitzah, and a son of the fifth possible father does Yibum (or Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If another of the mixed-up men died, the man who did Yibum and sons from three other (possible) fathers do Chalitzah, and a son from one father does Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Whenever a man from the mixture dies, his widow does Chalitzah with four men and may do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Chalitzos must be done before Yibum, lest her husband was from a different father (than the Yavam), and the 'Yibum' is really a Shomeres Yavam (improperly) marrying a stranger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When a second man from the mixture died, why must the man who did Yibum before do Chalitzah now? He should be allowed to do Yibum again!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not want one man to do Yibum to all of them. Rather, one man from each father does Yibum once. Perhaps each Yevamah will get her true Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If some of them (have) brothers, and some (have) no brothers - the brothers do Chalitzah, those without brothers do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Safra):</span> If some sons of the possible fathers are (only Safek) paternal brothers to a man from the mixture, and some are (perhaps only) maternal brothers, the maternal brothers do Chalitzah, and the paternal brothers do Yibum (or Chalitzah. I.e. if one of the mothers had children from two different men, any child of hers could be a maternal brother from a different father.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If some of the (possible) brothers are Kohanim and others are not, the Kohanim do Chalitzah and the others do Yibum (or Chalitzah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>If some brothers are Kohanim and others are (perhaps only) maternal brothers, both do Chalitzah, but not Yibum.</p>
