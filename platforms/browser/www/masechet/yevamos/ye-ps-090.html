<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A RABBINICALLY MARRIED GIRL MAY EAT <i>TERUMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> She is allowed to eat Terumah (even though mid'Oraisa she is a Zar)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She may eat only Terumah mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #4 (Beraisa):</span> If a Zar ate Tamei Terumah, he pays Chulin Tehorim (it becomes Terumah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sumchus says, if he paid Chulin Teme'im b'Shogeg, the payment is valid. If he was Mezid, it is not payment;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, in either case it is payment (it becomes Terumah), and he must pay also Chulin Tehorim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he was Mezid, why is the payment invalid? He should be blessed! He ate something that a Kohen cannot eat when he is Tamei, and paid something that a Kohen may eat when he is Tamei! (Even though it becomes Terumah when the Kohen receives it and then the Kohen cannot eat it, the Zar paid more than the value of what he ate. Why is he fined?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he ate Tamei Terumah, he pays anything. If he ate Tahor Terumah, he pays Chulin Tehorim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Sumchus says, if he paid Tamei Chulin b'Shogeg, the payment is valid. If he was Mezid, it is not payment;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Chachamim say, in either case it is payment, and he must pay also Chulin Tehorim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of Question #4:</span> Mid'Oraisa the payment is valid. If the Kohen would be Mekadesh a woman with it, she is Mekudeshes. Chachamim said that it is not payment, and they permit an Eshes Ish to marry someone else!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. 'It is not payment' means only that he must also pay Chulin Tehorim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, Sumchus agrees with Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> They argue about whether or not we fine Shogeg lest one transgress b'Mezid (and say that he was Shogeg).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REFRAINING FROM A <i>MITZVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #5 (Beraisa):</span> If Dam became Tamei and it was thrown on the Mizbe'ach:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Korban is Meratzeh if this was b'Shogeg, but not if it was b'Mezid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Tzitz is Meratzeh for Dam, meat and Chelev that became Tamei, whether Mezid or Shogeg, whether willingly or unwillingly, for an individual or the Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Mid'Oraisa, in either case it is Meratzeh. Chachamim decreed that b'Mezid it is not Meratzeh. The Korban brought in its place is Chulin ba'Azarah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> It was not Meratzeh to permit eating the meat, but it was Mechaper (no other Korban is brought).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #6:</span> In any case, the Mitzvah of eating the meat is uprooted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Ochlu Osam Asher Kupar Bahem" teaches that Kohanim eat and the owners receive Kaparah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim can command us to refrain from performing a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">90b----------------------------------------90b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> I was going to ask you about other Mitzvos that are uprooted:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Arel and Haza'ah (Chachamim decreed not to bring Korban Pesach within seven days after being circumcised, and not to sprinkle Mei Chatas on Shabbos, even if this prevents one from bringing Korban Pesach), a circumcision knife (one may not transgress an Isur mid'Rabanan to bring it, even if this prevents Milah on day eight on Shabbos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A linen garment (is exempt from Tzitzis), the sheep brought with Lechem ha'Panim on Shavuous (if they were slaughtered Lo Lishmah, if it is Shabbos one may not throw the blood), Shofar and Lulav (we do not fulfill them on Shabbos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Now that you answered that refraining from a Mitzvah is not considered uprooting a Mitzvah, the same answer applies to all of these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #7 (Beraisa):</span> "Listen to him", even if a prophet tells you that now it is necessary to transgress a Mitzvah, like Eliyahu (offered Shechutei Chutz) on Mount Karmel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is an exception, for it says "Listen to him"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #8:</span> We should learn from it (that Chachamim may uproot Mitzvos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different. It is to correct a breach. (Yisrael were serving idolatry, so Eliyahu showed them that "Hash-m Hu ha'Elokim".)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>UPROOTING TO FIX A PROBLEM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #9 (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If a man sent a Get with a Shali'ach and disqualified the Get, it is void;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he cannot disqualify it or add conditions to it. If he could, Beis Din's enactment has no power!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Mid'Oraisa, the Get is invalid. Because we are concerned for the power of Beis Din, we permit a married woman to remarry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Anyone who is Mekadesh does so according to Chachamim's rules, and they retroactively uprooted the Kidushin (of one who is Mevatel a Get).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> This explains one who is Mekadesh with money (retroactively the money was a gift). How can we answer for one who was Mekadesh through Bi'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Chachamim converted his Kidushin to Bi'as Zenus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #10 (Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> Beis Din can lash and punish not according to Torah, not to transgress Torah, but to make a fence for Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in which a man rode on a horse on Shabbos in the days of the Yevanim, and Beis Din stoned him. He did not deserve this, but it was necessary at the time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It once occurred that a man had Bi'ah with his wife under a fig tree, and was lashed for it. He did not deserve this, but it was necessary at the time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Fixing a breach is different (this is not called uprooting. The question is not resolved.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FINES WHEN HER HUSBAND RETURNS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (If her husband returned after she remarried,) neither man becomes Tamei to engage in her burial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Kohen may become Tamei "Ki Im <i>li'Sh'ero</i>". We learned that this refers to his wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> It also says "A husband will not become Tamei (for his wife)!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> He becomes Tamei for a permitted wife, but not for a forbidden wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Neither man receives her Metzi'os...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim enacted that a man receives his wife's Metzi'os to avoid resentment. Here, we are happy that there should be resentment (to ensure that he divorce her)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Nor her earnings ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Chachamim enacted that a man receives his wife's earnings, because he feeds her. Here he does not feed her, so he does not get her earnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Neither man can annul her vows ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Torah empowers a man to annul his wife's vows so she should not become repulsive to him. Here, we want her to be repulsive to him!</p>
