<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IS A <i>MITZRIS</i> FORBIDDEN? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Had R. Yehudah not said that the verse ascribes to birth (so females are forbidden) he would not have been able to defend himself!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that converts are part of Kehal Hash-m. If a Mitzris is permitted, whom may a Mitzri Sheni marry to permit his children?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> Perhaps the Torah teaches that b'Di'eved, if he married, his children are permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Torah does not discuss a b'Di'eved case.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Mamzerim are b'Di'eved, and the Torah discusses them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah teaches Isurim that come b'Di'eved, but not leniencies.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah teaches that a child of Machazir Gerushaso (after she was married in between) is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Primarily, the Torah wrote her Isur. We infer from it that her children are Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> Why did the Torah need to mention both "children" and "generations"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said only "Banim", one might have thought that the first two children of a Mitzri are forbidden, and the third is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had the Torah said only "Dor Shelishi", one might have thought that the Torah permits the third generation <i>of Yisraelim</i> born after Matan Torah to marry (any generation of converted) Mitzriyim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>"Lahem" - we count generations from them. "Lahem" - we follow whichever [parent] is disqualified. (It says "Lahem" twice.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Torah needed to write both "Lahem" and "Who will be born":</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it said only "Who will be born", we would think to count three generations starting with their children;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it said only "Lahem", we would think that if a pregnant Mitzris converted, her son is also a Mitzri Rishon. Therefore, it says "that will be born" to teach that he is a Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Torah needed to write "Lahem" regarding Mitzriyim and also "Lo" regarding Mamzerim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it said only "Lahem" regarding Mitzriyim (to forbid a child if either parent is a Mitzri), we would think that this is because Mitzriyim come from improper seed (i.e. of Nochrim, but this does not apply to Mamzerim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it said only "Lo" by Mamzerim (to forbid a child if either parent is a Mamzer), we would think that this is because all generations are forbidden (but we are not so stringent about Mitzriyim).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DO WE COUNT GENERATIONS FROM THE MOTHER OR FATHER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah, citing R. Yochanan):</span> If a Mitzri Sheni married a Mitzris Rishonah, the child is a Shelishi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that we follow the father.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef - Mishnah - R. Tarfon):</span> Mamzerim can purify their seed: If a Mamzer marries a slave, the child is a slave. If he frees the child, the child is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that we follow the mother!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different, for it says "the woman (slave) and her children will be to her master."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Minyamin was a Mitzri Rishon. He married a Mitzris Rishonah, and planned to marry his son to a Mitzris Sheniyah, in order to permit grandchildren.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we follow the father, he could even marry his son to a Mitzris Rishonah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, R. Yochanan said the correct text says that he will marry him to a Rishonah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi, citing R. Yochanan):</span> If a Mitzri Sheni married a Mitzris Rishonah, the child is a Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that we follow the mother.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> R. Yochanan taught that if a man designated a pregnant animal for his Chatas, and it gave birth, he may atone with the mother or the child.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Granted, if a fetus is not considered a limb of the mother, it is as if he set aside two animals for Acharayos (in case one cannot be offered, he will offer the other);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Oshaya said that in such a case he may atone with either one, and the other grazes (is permitted).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, if a fetus is like a limb of the mother, when it is born we apply to it the law of a child of a Chatas, and it must die (it cannot be offered)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rav Dimi was silent (presumably, we follow the mother only if the fetus is like a limb of her).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> (Really, R. Yochanan holds that a fetus is not a limb of the mother.) Perhaps the law of Mitzriyim is different - "That will be born" teaches that it depends on birth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> I saw your Rebbi (Rabah) there when R. Yochanan gave this explanation (surely, you heard from him)! Had the Torah not ascribed the Isur to birth, we would follow the father, like the norm.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava said that if a (pregnant) Nochris converted, her child need not immerse. Why not (if we normally follow the father)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is due to R. Yitzchak's law.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Mid'Oraisa, a Chatzitzah (interruption) invalidates Tevilah only if it covers most of the body, and it the person is particular about it. (The fetus does not mind that his mother surrounds him, so her Tevilah is also Tevilah of the fetus.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">78b----------------------------------------78b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Kahana taught that this is when the Chatzitzah covers a majority, but if the entire body is covered, the Tevilah is invalid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A fetus is different. Since he grows in his mother, she is not a Chatzitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina citing R. Yochanan):</span> For Nochrim (to decide which nation they are), we follow the father. After conversion, we follow Pesulim in either parent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>For Nochrim we follow the father, like a Beraisa teaches:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) - Question:</span> What is the source that if a Nochri fathered a child from a Kena'anis (of the seven nations), that the child may be bought for a slave (he need not be killed)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Also from the children of the residents that live with you, from them you may buy slaves."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this even applies to a Kena'ani who had a child from a Nochris?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher Holidu b'Artzechem" - those born (to mothers) in your land, not from those (fathered by Kena'anim from Nochriyos) who came to live in your land.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ravina taught that after conversion, we follow Pesulim in either parent. What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Mitzri married an Amonis, there is no problem with her. An Amoni is Asur, but not an Amonis!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, an Amoni married a Mitzris;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the child is a boy, we consider him an Amoni. If the child is a girl we consider her a Mitzris.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE PROHIBITION OF MAMZERIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mamzerim and Nesinim are forbidden forever, both males and females.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Reish Lakish):</span> A Mamzeres is permitted after 10 generations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>He learns from a Gezeirah Shavah "Asiri-Asiri" from Amoni and Mo'avi. Just like there, females are permitted, also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> There, females are permitted immediately. He should learn the same to Mamzerim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (The verse explicitly forbids Mamzerim (of both genders) until 10 generations.) The Gezeirah Shavah teaches that the Isur is permanent. We do not forbid more than the source, i.e. males.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Mamzerim and Nesinim are forbidden forever, both males and females.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish holds like the Tana who says Dun Minah u'Minah (we learn all laws of the case being learned from the source. Amoni teaches that Mamzerim are forever forbidden, and also that females are permitted);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana of the Mishnah says Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asra (we only learn one law from the source. Other laws are according to the law of the matter being learned. Amoni teaches only that the Isur is permanent.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law of a Mamzeres after 10 generations?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> If you show me a third generation Mamzer, I will declare him to be Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that Mamzerim do not live (to have generations).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Mamzerim do not live.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> They are forbidden forever.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira citing Rav Yehudah):</span> Known Mamzerim live; unknown Mamzerim do not. Those that are not known well do not live past three generations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>R. Ami announced that a certain man was a Mamzer; the man cried.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> I have given you life!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE ISUR OF THE NESINIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chana bar Ada):</span> David decreed against (marrying) Nesinim - "The king ... said that the Giv'onim are not from Bnei Yisrael." (They are called Nesinim because they were given to be slaves to cut wood and draw water.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he decree?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "There was a famine for three straight years in the days of David".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first year he suspected that it is due to idolatry amidst Yisrael - "And you will serve foreign gods ... and there will not be rain". He checked and did not find idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The second year he suspected that it is due to immorality - "The early and late rains were withheld, and you had the countenance of a harlot". He checked, and did not find.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The third year he suspected that it is due to people who publicly pledge Tzedakah and do not give it - "Clouds and wind, but no rain; a man glorifies himself in false gifts." He checked, and did not find. He concluded that it is due to himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "And David sought Hash-m's countenance" - how did he do so?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> He asked through the Urim v'Tumim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is this learned from the verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> It says "<b>PNEI</b> Hash-m", and by the Urim v'Tumim it says "li'FNEI Hash-m".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>"Hash-m said that it is due to Sha'ul and the house of blood, that he killed the Giv'onim."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is due to Sha'ul, i.e. that he was not eulogized properly;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not find that Sha'ul killed the Giv'onim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he killed the Kohanim of Nov, who used to supply food and water to the Giv'onim, the verse considers it as if he killed them (Rashi. Maharsha - the Giv'onim used to supply food and water to the Kohanim. Sha'ul deprived them of this great merit.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would Hash-m punish for not properly eulogizing Sha'ul, and also for Sha'ul's sin?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Seek Hash-m ... His judgment they carried out" - when Hash-m judges a person, He recounts his achievements.</p></div>
