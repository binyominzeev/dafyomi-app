<p class="dedicationbox">12th CYCLE DEDICATIONS<BR>&nbsp;<BR>YEVAMOS 47 - have been dedicated in honor of the Yahrzeit of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, NBG'M (3 Tamuz), by one of his Chasidim. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN DO WE ACCEPT CONVERTS? (Cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Beraisa - continued) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "b'Artzechem" teaches that this applies only in Eretz Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Itcha" - whenever you are.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "b'Artzechem"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In Eretz Yisrael, the convert must bring proof. In Chutz la'Aretz, he does not need proof;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim say, in every place he must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must a verse teach that he is believed when he comes with witnesses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The witnesses say 'we heard that he converted in Ploni's Beis Din';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that we do not believe them. The verse teaches that we believe them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can R. Yehudah expound "Itcha" to include Chutz la'Aretz? He already used it to teach that he must be established to you!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One of the teachings is learned from "Imach" (Rashi - Vayikra 25:35. Gra - the text should say "Itchem" (Vayikra 19:34), the verse after Itcha".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim require proof in Eretz Yisrael and outside. What do they learn from "b'Artzechem"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that we accept converts even in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that we do not accept them because they are insincere, and convert only due to the greatness of Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even now that Eretz Yisrael lost its former greatness, we might have thought that they convert only to receive agricultural gifts to the poor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The verse teaches that we accept their conversion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> The Halachah is, both in Eretz Yisrael and Chutz la'Aretz, he must bring a proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously the Halachah follows the majority (Chachamim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we follow R. Yehudah because his reasoning is better, i.e. the verse supports him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore R. Chiya needed to teach that the Halachah follows Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO IS BELIEVED ABOUT LINEAGE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "U'Shfatetem... u'Vein Gero" teaches that a Ger's conversion is valid only if was in Beis Din, but not if he converted by himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A man told R. Yehudah that he converted by himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> Do you have witnesses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">The man:</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> Do you have children?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">The man:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> You are believed to disqualify yourself, but not to disqualify your children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah holds that one is believed about his children!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Yakir" - he will make others know. This shows that a man is believed to say who is his firstborn.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, a Kohen is believed to say that his son (is a Chalal because he) was born to a divorcee or a Chalutzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, he is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Yehudah told him 'by your own admission you are a Nochri, so your testimony is invalid.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> R. Yehudah asked if he had children and grandchildren. The man said that he has both;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah said that he is believed to disqualify his children, but not his grandchildren.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A man is believed about his young son, but not about his old son.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> This does not refer to age. Rather, a son is called 'old' only if he has children. Otherwise, he is called 'young'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>The Halachah follows Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa supports Ravina!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa learns from "Yakir" when a Yisrael is believed, but a Nochri is not believed at all.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DISCOURAGING CONVERSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one comes to convert nowadays, we ask, 'Why do you want to convert? Don't you know that Yisrael are depressed, pushed around, humbled and afflicted?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he says, 'I know. If only I was worthy to share their affliction!', we accept him immediately, inform him of some light Mitzvos, some severe Mitzvos, the sin of (not giving) agricultural gifts to the poor, and the punishment of Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We tell him 'before converting, you did not get Kares for eating Chelev or stoned for Chilul Shabbos. Now, you are Chayav Kares for eating Chelev and stoned for Chilul Shabbos.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Just like we inform him of the punishment of Mitzvos, we also tell him of their reward. The world to come is only for Tzadikim; Yisrael at this time cannot receive too much good, nor too much punishments;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>We do not frighten him too much, nor are we so exacting with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If he still wants to convert, we circumcise him immediately. If strands remain that invalidate the Milah, we circumcise him again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>When he heals, we immerse him immediately. Two Chachamim stand over him and inform him of some light and severe Mitzvos. After immersing, he is a full Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>For a female convert, women see that she enters the water until her neck. Two Chachamim stand over her and inform her of some light and severe Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The law for a freed slave is the same as for a convert. Wherever a Nidah may immerse, a convert or freed slave may immerse. Any Chatzitzah (interruption) that invalidates Tevilah invalidates it for a convert, freed slave or Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we mention the difficulties of Yisrael and inform him of some of the Mitzvos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps this will deter him from converting (if he is insincere);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> Converts are problematic for Yisrael as Sapachas (a type of Tzara'as) - "V'Nilvah ha'Ger Aleihem v'NiSPeCHu Al Beis Yakov'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We inform him of the sin of agricultural gifts to the poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> This is because a Ben No'ach (Nochri) is killed for stealing less than a Perutah, and the theft cannot be corrected by returning the object. (We want him to know that the poor are entitled to these gifts. Alternatively, Nochrim are adamant about small amounts or money. Perhaps hearing the punishment for not leaving these gifts will cause him to retract.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not frighten him too much, nor are we so exacting with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> We learn from "(Naomi) saw that (Rus) insisted on going with her, and ceased speaking with her."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Naomi:</span> On Shabbos we may not leave the Techum (a Mil around the city).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rus:</span> "Where you go, I will go."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Naomi:</span> We may not be secluded with men.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rus:</span> "Where you spend the night, I will lodge."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Naomi:</span> We are commanded to keep 613 Mitzvos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rus:</span> "Your nation is my nation."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Naomi:</span> Idolatry is forbidden to us.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rus:</span> "Your G-d is my G-d."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Naomi:</span> Four death penalties are administered by Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Rus:</span> "Like you die, I will die."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Naomi:</span> There are two graveyards for those executed by Beis Din (for those who received lighter and harsher deaths).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Rus:</span> "And there I will be buried."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Immediately - "She saw that she was insistent..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he accepts to convert, we circumcise him immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because we do not delay a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If strands remain that invalidate the circumcision, we circumcise him again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Strands of flesh that cover the majority of the crown invalidate circumcision;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If these remained on a Kohen, he may not eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Flesh that covers most of the height of the crown (invalidates the circumcision).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When he heals, we immerse him immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not immerse him earlier, because water aggravates the wound.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE <i>BEIS</i> <i>DIN</i> FOR CONVERSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Two Chachamim stand over him...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that conversion requires three!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, R. Yochanan said that the correct text of the Beraisa says three Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> After immersing, he is a full Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The ramifications of this are that if he retracts his conversion, then is Mekadesh a Bas Yisrael, he is considered a heretic Yisrael, and his Kidushin takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> The law of a freed slave is like the law of a convert.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are thinking that they are the same regarding accepting the yoke of Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> This refers to a convert, but a freed slave need not accept the Mitzvos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> Beraisa #1 is like Chachamim; Beraisa #2 is R. Shimon ben Elazar:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "(If one sees a Yefas To'ar (a beautiful Nochris) in war and desires her,) she will cry over her father and mother (for a month)" - this is if she did not accept to convert. If she accepted, he immerses her and she is permitted to him immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, even if she did not accept, he may immerse her to become a slave, and immerse her a second time to free (convert) her.</p>
