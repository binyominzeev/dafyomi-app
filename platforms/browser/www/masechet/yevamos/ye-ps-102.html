<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>FOR WHAT CAN A CONVERT BE A JUDGE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Mid'Oraisa, a convert can judge a case between converts. It says "You will put on yourself a king ... amidst your brethren" - on you, a ruler must be amidst your brethren, but a convert can judge converts.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one's mother is a Yisrael, he can even judge a Yisrael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>For Chalitzah, both parents must be from Yisrael - "His name will be called in Yisrael".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT IS NEEDED FOR CHALITZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah citing Rav):</span> If Eliyahu would come and say that we do Chalitzah with a Min'al (a soft leather shoe), we would heed him. If he would say that we do not do Chalitzah with a sandal, we would not heed him, because we are accustomed to using a sandal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef citing Rav):</span> If Eliyahu would say that we do not do Chalitzah with a Min'al, we would heed him. If he would say that we do not do Chalitzah with a sandal, we would not heed him, because we are accustomed to using a sandal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these two versions?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> According to Rabah, we may not use a Min'al l'Chatchilah. According to Rav Yosef, we may.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> If they did Chalitzah with a Min'al, it is Kesherah,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This connotes that it is b'Di'eved!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is even l'Chatchilah. Since the Seifa says that if it was done with an Anpilya (a slipper or sock) it is invalid even b'Di'eved, the Reisha also discusses b'Di'eved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Tana'im argue about whether a Min'al may be used l'Chatchilah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> An elder said that he saw R. Yehudah ben Beseira oversee many Chalitzos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> Did he use a Min'al or a sandal?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">The elder:</span> Is a Min'al really Kesherah? (The Torah said a shoe, not a Min'al! - some texts delete this)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> If so, why did R. Meir say that if Chalitzah was done with a Min'al, it is Kesherah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Yakov says, R. Meir permits a Min'al l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for the opinion that a Min'al is only b'Di'eved?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (Chalitzah must be "me'Al (from) Raglo".) The top of a Min'al is considered me'Al his foot, and the straps (Rashi; Aruch - the leather covering) is me'Al of me'Al (from on top of)" his foot.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Chalitzah should be invalid b'Di'eved!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a decree, lest one use a torn (Rashi; Aruch - loose) Min'al, or a half-Min'al.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Had I not seen R. Chiya oversee a Chalitzah using a sandal with laces, I would have allowed only an Arab sandal, that is tight-fitting.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though our sandals are tied, we tie a thin rope to make it an ideal Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHAT IS CONSIDERED TAKING OFF THE SHOE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Once most of the heel is removed, the Yevamah is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If the straps of a Min'al or sandal were untied, or if he removed most of his foot, the Chalitzah is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It is invalid only because he removed the majority. Had she removed it, it would be valid!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The majority of the foot is required, not most of the heel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Most of the foot' refers to most of the heel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana calls it 'foot' because it supports the foot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This supports R. Yanai;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> Whether he untied the shoe and she removed it, or she untied the shoe and he removed it, the Chalitzah is invalid. She must untie the shoe and remove it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (R. Yanai):</span> If she tore the shoe off, what is the law? If she burned the shoe, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Chalitzah require exposing the foot, this was done;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the shoe must be removed, this was not done.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>These questions are unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Nechemyah):</span> If he is wearing two shoes, one on top of the other, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If she removed the outer shoe, and left the inner shoe, surely it is Pasul. We require "me'Al Raglo", not from on top of his foot!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, she tore the outer shoe and removed the inner shoe, and left the outer shoe on his foot;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If removal of the shoe is required, this was done.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If she must expose the foot, this was not done.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">102b----------------------------------------102b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it normal to wear a shoe on top of a shoe? (Tosfos - the Gemara often asks about unusual things. We ask because Chalitzah requires a shoe worn normally.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! Rav Yehudah walked in the market wearing five pairs of cloth (felt) shoes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> (Even) if a Yevamah grew up among the Yevamim, she may do Yibum. We are not concerned lest she took off the sandal of one of them</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If we knew that she took off his sandal, we would be concerned!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Whether he intended for Chalitzah, but she didn't; or if she intended for Chalitzah, but he didn't - the Chalitzah is invalid until both have intention.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, Rav Yehudah taught that even if we saw that she took off his sandal, we are not concerned lest they had intention.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed, if she took off a Yavam's sandal, we are concerned!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that Chalitzah without intent does not permit her l'Shuk, but she is forbidden to do Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>FROM WHAT MUST THE SHOE BE MADE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A sandal stitched with linen may not be used for Chalitzah - "I gave you shoes of Tachash" (an animal whose hide was used to make a cover for the Mishkan).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should say that only Tachash may be used!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse of Chalitzah says "shoe" twice, to include (leather of other animals).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should allow all materials!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, what would we learn from the verse "Shoes of Tachash"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> If a shoe is of leather and the straps are of goats' hair, may it be used?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Yes, this is like Tachash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even if the entire shoe is of hair, it should be permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is called Karka (like a Min'al - it is not called a shoe).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE MEANING OF CHALITZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> How do we know that 'Choltzah' means that she removes?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> "V'Chaltzu (they will remove) the stones in which there is a plague".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it means to invigorate (i.e. put on the shoe), like "Hechaltzu (prepare) from yourselves men for the army"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There also, it means to remove (men from their houses to go to fight).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Yechaletz (He will support) a poor person in his poverty"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There also, his reward for bearing poverty will be removal of punishments in Gehenom".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Hash-m's angel camps by those who fear Him va'Ychaltzem (and will save them)"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A reward for fearing Hash-m will be exemption from punishment in Gehenom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "And your bones Yachalitz";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> This is the greatest of the blessings.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is strengthening of the bones.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the word can mean to strengthen or to remove. Regarding Chalitzah, had it meant strengthening (putting on) it would have said 'On his foot'. <span class="note">(<span>Note:</span> It seems that this is another answer for questions (c), (e) and (g).)</span></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Had it said 'On his foot', one might have thought that it must be done on the foot, but not the shin. "Me'Al Raglo" teaches that the shin is also acceptable!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it meant that she puts on his shoe, it would have said 'b'me'Al' (to include the shin). "Me'Al" teaches that she removes the shoe.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">A heretic:</span> Hash-m cast off your nation - "... Chalatz from them"!</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>CHALITZAH WITH AN ANPILYA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chalitzah with an Anpilya (slipper or sock) is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> An Anpilya is not a Min'al.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> One who comes to take Terumas ha'Lishkah (Shekalim to buy Korbanos Tzibur) does not enter the room wearing a cloak with a hem (lest people suspect that he hid Shekalim for himself in the hem) nor with Anpilya. We need not forbid with a Min'al or sandal, since no one may enter the Mikdash wearing a Min'al or sandal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> A Min'al, sandal and Anpilya all have the same law (on Yom Kipur). One may not walk in them from house to house, nor from bed to bed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Anpilya in the Beraisa has soft wads in it, and is forbidden because it is pleasurable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If it is not a Min'al, it is not forbidden on Yom Kipur just because it is pleasurable!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rabah bar Rav Huna went out with a turban wrapped on his leg!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> A cloth Anpilya is not like a shoe; a leather Anpilya is.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> If we will not say so, there is a contradiction between Beraisos about Yom Kipur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A person may not walk in Kordakisin (undershoes worn to protect from water) in his house, but he may walk in Anpilin in his house.</p></div>
