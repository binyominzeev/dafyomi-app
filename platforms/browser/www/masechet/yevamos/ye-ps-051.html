<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHY DOESN'T A GET TAKE EFFECT AFTER A GET?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why does R. Gamliel say that a Get does not take effect after a Get, nor a Ma'amar after a Ma'amar?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> R. Gamliel is unsure whether or not a Get repels (Zikah), and whether or not a Ma'amar acquires;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the first Get repelled, there is nothing left for the second Get to do. If the first Get did not repel, neither does the second!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the first Ma'amar acquires, the second Ma'amar cannot acquire. If the first Ma'amar does not acquire, neither does the second!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> R. Gamliel admits that a Get takes effect after a Ma'amar, and a Ma'amar after a Get. A Get takes effect after Yibum that followed a Ma'amar, and a Ma'amar takes effect after Yibum that followed a Get.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If R. Gamliel was in doubt, when Yibum is in the middle (it should acquire if possible, i.e. if the Ma'amar did not acquire or the Get did not repel. In any case no Zikah remains after the Yibum, so) it should be like Yibum at the beginning, i.e. nothing should take effect after it!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When Bi'ah is at the beginning, nothing takes effect after it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> R. Gamliel is certain that Get repels and that Ma'amar acquires. However, it was enacted that Get repels one 'side' (part of the Zikah), and Ma'amar acquires one (the 'other') side;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A second Get doesn't work, since the first Get already repelled as much as a Get can;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A second Ma'amar doesn't work, since the first already acquired as much as a Ma'amar can.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A Get after a Ma'amar takes effect, and also a Ma'amar after a Get, since one acquires (one side), and one repels (the other side).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Chachamim say that we enacted that each Yavam has a power to acquire or repel with a Ma'amar or Get (therefore, a Get after a Get or a Ma'amar after a Ma'amar takes effect).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>(According to R. Gamliel,) a Pasul Yibum is better than a Ma'amar in one respect, and in one respect it is inferior;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In one way it is better. Ma'amar does not take effect after Ma'amar, but Yibum takes effect after Ma'amar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In one way it is inferior. Ma'amar acquires everything that a Get leaves over (i.e. so a subsequent Ma'amar does not take effect), whereas Yibum after a Get does not acquire all the remaining Zikah (so Ma'amar takes effect after the Yibum).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE CASE OF GET AFTER GET, AND MA'AMAR AFTER MA'AMAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In what case did R. Gamliel say that a Get does not take effect after a Get? If two Yevamos fell to one Yavam, and he gave a Get to each (e.g. to Leah and then to Chanah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Gamliel says, he does Chalitzah to Leah and he is forbidden to her relatives. He is permitted to Chanah's relatives;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim forbid him to the relatives of both of them. He does Chalitzah to one of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The same applies when there are two Yevamim and one Yevamah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>In what case did R. Gamliel say that a Ma'amar does not take effect after a Ma'amar? If two Yevamos fell to one Yavam, and he gave a Ma'amar to Leah and then to Chanah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Gamliel says, he gives a Get and does Chalitzah to Leah and is forbidden to her relatives. He is permitted to Chanah's relatives;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The same applies when there are two Yevamim and one Yevamah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Gamliel says that he does Chalitzah [only] to Leah. This refutes Shmuel!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one does Chalitzah to Ba'alas ha'Get, her Tzarah is not exempted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel's law is like the opinion that Yesh Zikah. R. Gamliel holds that Ein Zikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If R. Gamliel holds that Ein Zikah, Chachamim hold that Yesh Zikah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">51b----------------------------------------51b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> The same applies to two Yevamim and one Yevamah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This refutes Rabah bar Rav Huna!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> A Yevamah who did a Chalitzah Pesulah (i.e. Yibum was forbidden) must do Chalitzah with all the brothers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Rejection of Inference):</span> No, Chachamim agree that Ein Zikah. They argue about a Get after a Get and a Ma'amar after a Ma'amar. (Rabah bar Rav Huna's law is like the opinion that Yesh Zikah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Gamliel):</span> If he gave a Ma'amar to Leah and then to Chanah, he gives a Get and does Chalitzah to Leah and is forbidden to her relatives. He is permitted to Chanah's relatives.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since R. Gamliel holds that a Ma'amar doesn't take effect after a Ma'amar, he should be allowed to do Yibum with the first (Leah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a decree not to, lest people come to do Yibum with Chanah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TANA'IM WHO HOLD THAT MA'AMAR FULLY ACQUIRES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Gamliel, Beis Shamai, R. Shimon, Ben Azai, and R. Nechemyah all hold that Ma'amar fully (i.e. significantly) acquires.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We learned about R. Gamliel above (a Ma'amar after a Ma'amar does not take effect).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Reuven and Shimon were married to sisters, and their brother Levi was single. Reuven died; Levi gave the Yevamah a Ma'amar, then Shimon died. Levi may keep his wife (the Ma'amar is full Kidushin). Her sister is exempt, for she is Achos Ishto.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>(R. Shimon and Chachamim argue (96b) about two minors above nine years old who had Bi'ah with their Yevamah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon to Chachamim):</span> If the first Yibum (e.g. of Levi) is considered Yibum, Reuven's Yibum is not Yibum (to forbid her to Levi). If Levi's Yibum is not Yibum, neither is Reuven's!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We equated the Yibum of a nine-year-old to a Ma'amar, and R. Shimon says that the second Yibum does not take effect after the first!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Ben Azai):</span> A Ma'amar takes effect after a Ma'amar when there are two Yevamim and one Yevamah, but not when there is one Yavam and two Yevamos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Nechemyah):</span> Yibum and Chalitzah have the same law. Whether they come at the beginning, middle, or end, nothing takes effect after them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Pasul Yibum is like a Ma'amar, and he says that nothing takes effect after it!</p></div>
