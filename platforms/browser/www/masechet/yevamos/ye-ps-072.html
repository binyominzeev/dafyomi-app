<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't they circumcise in the Midbar?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They were weak from travelling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The north wind (it is the most gentle) did not blow (during the day).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All 40 years that Yisrael were in the Midbar, the north wind did not blow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Hash-m showd displeasure with Bnei Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It would have scattered the Clouds of Glory.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Therefore, we do not circumcise on a cloudy day or on a day when the south wind (the harshest) blows. We do not let blood on such days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Nowadays that many people do this, [we do not protest. We rely on] "Hash-m watches over the simple".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All 40 years in the Midbar, each night the north wind blew at midnight - "At midnight, Hash-m killed every firstborn".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is this learned from this verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It shows that Hash-m is appeased at midnight.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A MASHUCH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Mid'Oraisa, a Mashuch (a circumcised person whose foreskin covers the crown) may eat Terumah. Chachamim decreed that he may not, because he looks like an Arel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A Mashuch must be circumcised.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The one who asked should have anticipated the answer! (The Beraisa does not say that he is an Arel, merely he must circumcise!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa made him err:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Yehudah):</span> He should not circumcise, because it is dangerous (lest he be castrated).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Many were circumcised in the days of Ben Koziva (after Nochrim forcibly were Moshech foreskins of Yisrael), and they had children! "Himol Yimol" - even 100 times! "He annulled my covenant" includes a Mashuch!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was the second verse needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that circumcision is repeated only for strands that invalidate the Milah. The second verse teaches that even a Mashuch must circumcise again.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The one who asked thought that since verses are brought, the law is mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>This is wrong. The law is mid'Rabanan; the verses are only Asmachtos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A Tumtum does not eat Terumah. His wives and slaves eat. A Mashuch and one born circumcised may eat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An Androginus (one who has male and female genitals) eats Terumah, but not Kodshim; a Tumtum eats neither Terumah nor Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Beraisa permits a Mashuch and one born circumcised to eat. This refutes Rav Huna.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A TUMTUM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Tumtum does not eat Terumah. His Nashim (wives) and slaves eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does a Tumtum have wives?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He was Mekadesh a woman:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Tumtum was Mekadesh a woman or became Mekudeshes to a man, the Kidushin takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It takes effect to be stringent, but not to be lenient!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Tumtum is a Safek woman. If the Tumtum is truly female, when she was Mekadesh a woman it is not Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The case is, (his Ever is covered but) the testicles can be recognized.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He feeds his 'Nashim' (women), i.e. his mother (if she is a Bas Yisrael widowed or divorced from a Kohen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that only one who can have children permits eating. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Tumtum eats neither Terumah nor Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, according to Abaye the Reisha teaches about a Vadai Arel (the Beitzim can be recognized) and the Seifa teaches about a (Safek woman,) Safek Arel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rava, why must the Seifa repeat (the Isur to eat Terumah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here, 'Tumtum' refers to a (Vadai) Arel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Reisha forbids a Safek Arel to eat. There is no need to teach that a Vadai Arel may not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa explains the Reisha:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Tumtum may not eat Terumah because he is a Safek Arel, and an Arel may not eat Terumah or Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about Rav Huna's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following may only be circumcised in daytime: a Mashuch; a convert who was circumcised before converting; a baby past his time (eight days); and all others who are circumcised, i.e. one who has two foreskins;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar bar Shimon says, in the proper time they are circumcised only during the day. After the time, it may be at night.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">72b----------------------------------------72b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The first Tana holds that Mashuch must be circumcised mid'Oraisa, and R. Elazar bar Shimon requires this mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is unreasonable! Mashuch is taught with a baby past his time, which all agree is mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, all agree that Mashuch is mid'Rabanan, and that a baby past his time is mid'Oraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The first Tana expounds the Vav in "<i>U</i>va'Yom" (to require Milah during the day even after the time. Chachamim pattern the law of Mashuch after the mid'Oraisa law);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Elazar does not expound it (so Milah after the time may be at night, and all the more so Mashuch).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Nosar (Korbanos that were not eaten in the allotted time) in the proper time (to burn it) must be burned during the day. After the time, it may be burned even at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (R. Elazar - Beraisa) Question:</span> ('Ba'Yom ha'Shemini' teaches that) Milah on the eighth day must be during the day. What is the source that Milah must be during the day even if it is on day nine, 10, 11 or 12 (e.g. we are unsure which day he was born, so we must wait until a Yom Chol)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "<i>U</i>va'Yom".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Also, even the opinion that does not expound Vav expounds Vav-Hei (so "Veha'Nosar" teaches that it must always be burned during the day)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>R. Yochanan was silent. After R. Elazar left, R. Yochanan said that R. Elazar expounds like Moshe learning from Hash-m!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> He did not expound on his own. He learned from a Beraisa in Toras Kohanim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>R. Yochanan went and learned Toras Kohanim in three days, and spent three months thinking it over.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CAN AN <i>AREL</i> DO <i>HAZA'AH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If an Arel did Haza'ah (sprinkled water sanctified with ashes of Parah Adumah), it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like a Tevul Yom (one who immersed today from Tum'ah). Even though a Tevul Yom is forbidden to Terumah (until evening), he is Kosher for Parah Adumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> One cannot learn from a Tevul Yom, since he may eat Ma'aser (Sheni, but an Arel may not)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not discuss eating, rather, touching!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Tevul Yom may not touch Terumah, but he is Kosher for Parah Adumah. An Arel may touch Terumah, all the more so, he is Kosher for Parah Adumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Haza'ah of an Arel is valid. A case occurred, and Chachamim validated the Haza'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Tumtum was Mekadesh (water with the ashes), his Kidush is invalid, since he is a Safek Arel, and Kidush of an Arel is invalid. If an Androginus was Mekadesh, his Kidush is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, even Kidush of an Androginus is invalid, since he is a Safek female, and Kidush of a female is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that an Arel or a Safek Arel may not be Mekadesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> That Tana holds like Tana d'vei R. Akiva, who considers an Arel like a Tamei:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "Ish Ish" (regarding the Isur for a Tamei to eat Terumah) includes an Arel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why isn't there a Mishnah or Beraisa that teaches 'an Arel and a Tamei', and we will establish it like R. Akiva?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We do find this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An Arel and a Tamei are exempt from Re'iyah (the Mitzvah to enter the Mikdash on the festival).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> An Arel is not exempt from Re'iyah because he is considered Tamei, rather, because he is repulsive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yehudah and Chachamim are consistent with what they taught elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All are Kosher to be Mekadesh (water with the ashes) except for a deaf person, lunatic or minor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, a minor may Mekadesh, but a woman or Androginus may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Chachamim learn from "V'Lakchu... me'Afar... (v'Nasan Alav Mayim)" - only one who may gather may be Mekadesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Yehudah disagrees, for if so it should have said 'V'Lakach (singular)'! Rather "V'Lakchu (plural)" teaches that those who are Pesulim to gather may do Kidush.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even a woman should be Kosher for Kidush!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "V'Nasan (masculine)" to exclude women.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Chachamim disagree. It did not say both in the singular "V'Lakach... v'Nasan", for this would teach that one person takes the ashes and another takes the water (Rashi; Tosfos - the same one who put the ashes on the water must mix them together). Therefore, it says "V'Lakchu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It did not say "V'Lakchu... v'Nasnu", for this would teach that two take the ashes and two put the water;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, it says "V'Lakchu... v'Nasan" to teach that even two may take the ashes and one may put the water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>"And the Tahor will sprinkle on the Tamei" implies that he is considered Tahor for Haza'ah, but he is Tamei for other things!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that a Tevul Yom is Kosher for Parah Adumah.</p>
