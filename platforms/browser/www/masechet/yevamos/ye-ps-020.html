<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE REASON OF R. SHIMON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> When he does Yibum, she is like his wife in all respects.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> This teaches that he can divorce her and remarry her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Here too, we should say that she still has the status of a Yevamah, and Chalitzah should be required (to divorce her)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "u'Lekachah Lo l'Ishah" - once he takes her, she is like his wife in all respects.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It also says "v'Yibmah" (she is still like a Yevamah)! Why do we expound this regarding Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo, but not regarding divorce?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is reasonable to apply the Heter (to divorce without Chalitzah) to the permitted case (regular Yibum), and the Isur to the forbidden case (Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon says that since he entered the world when she was permitted, she remains permitted. If: Levi was born after his maternal sister (Dinah) married Shimon's paternal brother (Yosef), and then Yosef died, R. Shimon should permit Yibum, since Levi found her permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. The Isur of a maternal sister is there!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Here also, R. Shimon should say that the Isur of Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo is there!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Isur is sometimes lifted. A maternal sister is never permitted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WOMEN WHO DO <i>CHALITZAH</i>, AND NOT <i>YIBUM</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Klal (general rule) is, any Isur of Ervah does neither Yibum nor Chalitzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>An Isur of Mitzvah or Kedushah does Chalitzah but not Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Isurim of Mitzvah are Sheniyos (relatives forbidden mid'Rabanan). Isurim of Kedushah are a widow to a Kohen Gadol, a divorcee or a Chalutzah to a regular Kohen, a Mamzeres or Nesinah to a Yisrael, and a Bas Yisrael to a Nasin or Mamzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Her sister that is his Yevamah does Chalitzah or Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does 'the Klal' come to include?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rafram bar Papa):</span> It includes Tzaras Ailonis, like Rav Asi holds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Inference: Regarding Isurim of Ervah the Tzarah is forbidden. In other cases, the Tzarah is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rafram bar Papa):</span> It includes Tzaras Ailonis, unlike Rav Asi. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Her sister that is his Yevamah...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whose sister is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is the sister of Isurei Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Mid'Oraisa, Isurei Mitzvah fall to Yibum like regular Yevamos, so he may not marry the sister!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the sister of Ervah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Isurim of Mitzvah are Sheniyos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are they called Isurei Mitzvah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is a Mitzvah to obey the commands of Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Isurim of Kedushah are a widow to a Kohen Gadol...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are these called Isurei Kedushah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says about Kohanim "Kedoshim Yihyu (they will observe Isurei Kehunah)".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Yehudah learns oppositely. Isurim of Mitzvah are a widow to a Kohen Gadol...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are these called Isurei Mitzvah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Eleh ha'Mitzvos" (refers to all the Mitzvos in Vayikra, including Isurei Kehunah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Yehudah call Sheniyos Isurei Kedushah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> One who fulfills mid'Rabanan Mitzvos is called Kadosh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If one does not keep mid'Rabanan Mitzvos, is he merely not called Kadosh? He is called a Rasha!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Mekadesh (sanctify) yourselves through (abstention from) what is permitted to you.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>YIBUM OF CHAYVEI LAVIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A widow to a Kohen Gadol...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We do not distinguish whether she was widowed from Kidushin or Nisu'in.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand this if she was widowed from marriage. A Lav and an Aseh forbid her, and an Aseh (Yibum) does not override them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, if she was widowed from Kidushin, only a Lav forbids her. The Aseh should override it (Yibum should be allowed)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Gidal):</span> "<i>Yevimto</i> will ascend to the gate" is extra, to teach that there is a Yevamah who does Chalitzah but not Yibum, i.e. Chayavei Lavin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to Chayavei Kerisos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "If he does not want" connotes that if he wanted, he could do Yibum. Anyone who could do Yibum (but does not want to) does Chalitzah. Anyone who cannot do Yibum does not do Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so the same should apply to Chayavei Lavin!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yevimto" includes them among those who do Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The verse does not specify what to include and exclude.) Why do we include Chayavei Lavin and exclude Chayavei Kerisos, and not vice-versa?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kidushin of Chayavei Lavin takes effect, so it is more reasonable to include them than Chayavei Kerisos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If one did Yibum or Chalitzah with Isurei Mitzvah or Isurei Kedushah, the Tzarah is exempted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If mid'Oraisa Chayavei Lavin do Chalitzah but not Yibum, why does Yibum exempt the Tzarah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Beraisa taught separate laws together;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Yibum of Isurei Mitzvah, or Chalitzah of Isurei Kedushah, exempts the Tzarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven is a Petzu'a Daka, Krus Shofchah or Seris Adam (castrated, and hence forbidden to marry), or if he is too old (to have children), he does Chalitzah or Yibum (Rashi - Yibum is Asur, but if done it acquires; Hagahos ha'Gra - he does Chalitzah <i>but not</i> Yibum);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If his widow fell to Yibum and his brother Shimon gave a Ma'amar or Get or did Chalitzah, it takes effect. If he did Yibum, he acquires her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Shimon died and Reuven gave a Ma'amar or Get or did Chalitzah, it takes effect. If he did Yibum, he acquires her, but they may not remain married - "Lo Yavo Fetzu'a Daka ... (bi'Khal Hash-m)".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If mid'Oraisa, Chayavei Lavin do Chalitzah but not Yibum, why does he acquire her through Yibum?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (c) - Rava):</span> Also a widow from Kidushin is forbidden to a Kohen Gadol by an Aseh (as well as a Lav), "Kedoshim Yihyu."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we answer for a Mamzeres or Nesinah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is an Aseh (even for Yisraelim) "V'Hiskadashtem".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, every Lav in the Torah is also an Aseh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Chachamim decreed that a widow from Kidushin may not do Yibum, lest a widow from Nisu'in do Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we answer for Mamzeres or Nesinah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim forbade them to do Yibum, lest one marry them Stam (without the Mitzvah of Yibum).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, we should forbid a paternal brother to do Yibum, lest a maternal brother (marry Eshes Achiv, and) think that he does Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People will not confuse these. They know that Yibum depends on inheritance.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We should forbid a woman without children to do Yibum, lest a woman with children do Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People will not confuse these. They know that Yibum depends on (not having) children.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We should forbid Eshes Achiv she'<i>Hayah</i> b'Olamo to do Yibum, lest Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo do Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People will not confuse these. They know that Yibum depends on dwelling together in the world.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> No woman should do Yibum, lest an Ailonis do Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An Ailonis is uncommon, so we do not make such a decree.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Mamzeres and Nesinah are also uncommon (yet we decreed)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> We forbid Yibum lest he have a second Bi'ah with her (which is forbidden).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If they did Yibum he acquires her with the first Bi'ah. A second Bi'ah is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (and Answer #5 - Rava):</span> My answer is wrong. Reish Lakish taught that an Aseh overrides a Lav only if one cannot fulfill both;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Here, both can be fulfilled through Chalitzah!</p></div>
