<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHO DISQUALIFIES A YEVAMAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Seris did Chalitzah, he did not disqualify her (from Kehunah. If he had Bi'ah with her, he disqualified her.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A Yavam Seris disqualifies a Yevamah through Bi'ah (because it is Eshes Ach without the Mitzvah of Yibum), but a stranger does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes Rav Hamnuna:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> If a Shomeres Yavam had Bi'ah with a stranger, she may not do Yibum. (She is like an Eshes Ish who was Mezaneh; she becomes a Zonah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, also a stranger who has Bi'ah with her disqualifies her. Since the Reisha discusses the Yavam, also the Seifa does.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Also an Ailonis who did Chalitzah (is not disqualified, unless she had Bi'ah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If she did not have Bi'ah, she is Kesherah to Kehunah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This is unlike R. Yehudah, who says that every Ailonis is a Zonah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TUMTUM AND ANDROGINUS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Seris Chamah Kohen who married a Bas Yisrael permits her to eat Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi and R. Shimon say, an Androginus Kohen who married a Bas Yisrael permits her to eat Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, a Tumtum who was torn and found to be a male does not do Chalitzah, since he is like a Seris.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>An Androginus may marry a woman, but he may not be married to a man;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, one is stoned for Bi'ah with an Androginus, like with a man.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> This is obvious (that the wife of a Seris Chamah Kohen eats Terumah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that only a man who can have children permits others to eat Terumah. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yosi and R. Shimon say, an Androginus ...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He permits his wife to eat Terumah, but not Chazah v'Shok (the chest and foreleg of a Shelamim, which are given to Kohanim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He permits her to eat even Chazah v'Shok.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Reish Lakish permit her to eat Terumah, but not Chazah v'Shok? Both are forbidden mid'Oraisa to a Zar!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He permits her to eat Terumah only nowadays, when it is only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he forbid her when the Mikdash stands and Terumah is mid'Oraisa? If so, why did he teach that she may not eat Chazah v'Shok? He should have distinguished within Terumah itself, that she may only eat Rabbinic Terumah, but not Terumah mid'Oraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is what he taught! He permits her to eat Rabbinic Terumah nowadays, but not when there is Chazah v'Shok (i.e. when the Beis ha'Mikdash stands), even Rabbinic Terumah, lest she come to eat Terumah mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan (to Reish Lakish):</span> Do you hold that Terumah is only mid'Rabanan nowadays?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> Yes. I learn from a Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A ring (of pressed figs of Terumah that was mixed with rings of Chulin) becomes Batel (one may eat from the mixture. If Terumah (of grain) was mid'Oraisa, we would be stringent about all Terumah and say that something sold by number is not Batel!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> A piece (of a Korban that was mixed with other pieces) becomes Batel (even though it is an Isur mid'Oraisa)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do you think that the Mishnah (brought below) says '<i>All</i> that (i.e. even sometimes) is counted (is never Batel)'? The text is, '<i>That</i> which (always) is counted'!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHAT CAN BECOME BATEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> About which Mishnah do they argue?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Bundles of clover of Kil'ai ha'Kerem (crossbreeds in a vineyard) must be burned. If they became mixed with (permitted) bundles, all must be burned;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">81b----------------------------------------81b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chachamim say, they are Batel if there are 201 bundles in all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Meir says, all that it is normally counted, forbids (it is never Batel);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Chachamim say, only six things are never Batel - nuts of Parech, pomegranates of Badan, sealed barrels (of wine), leeks, large stalks of cabbage, and Greek gourds;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Akiva adds a seventh, loaves of a homeowner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Some of these (the first three) are forbidden (the first three years of the tree) due to Orlah. The others are forbidden if they were Kil'ayim b'Kerem.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan says, the text (of R. Meir's words) is "That which is counted';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish says, it says 'All that is counted'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Beraisa about 'a piece'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a Tamei piece of a Chatas or of Lechem ha'Panim was mixed with 100 Tahor pieces, it is Batel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it is not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a Tahor piece of a Chatas or Lechem ha'Panim was mixed with 100 Tahor Chulin pieces, all agree that it is not Batel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish):</span> (Even though pieces are counted,) the Reisha teaches that it is Batel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya brei d'Rav Huna):</span> The case is, the piece was dissolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does R. Yehudah say that it is not Batel?</p></div>
