<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO DISQUALIFIES A <i>YEVAMAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Seris did Chalitzah, he did not disqualify her (from Kehunah. If he had Bi'ah with her, he disqualified her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A Yavam Seris disqualifies a Yevamah through Bi'ah (because it is Eshes Ach without the Mitzvah of Yibum), but a stranger does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes Rav Hamnuna:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> If a Shomeres Yavam had Bi'ah with a stranger, she may not do Yibum. (She is like an Eshes Ish who was Mezaneh; she becomes a Zonah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, also a stranger who has Bi'ah with her disqualifies her. Since the Reisha discusses the Yavam, also the Seifa does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Also an Ailonis who did Chalitzah (is not disqualified, unless she had Bi'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If she did not have Bi'ah, she is Kesherah to Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This is unlike R. Yehudah, who says that every Ailonis is a Zonah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TUMTUM AND ANDROGINUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Seris Chamah Kohen who married a Bas Yisrael permits her to eat Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi and R. Shimon say, an Androginus Kohen who married a Bas Yisrael permits her to eat Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, a Tumtum who was torn and found to be a male does not do Chalitzah, since he is like a Seris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>An Androginus may marry a woman, but he may not be married to a man;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Eliezer says, one is stoned for Bi'ah with an Androginus, like with a man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> This is obvious (that the wife of a Seris Chamah Kohen eats Terumah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that only a man who can have children permits others to eat Terumah. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yosi and R. Shimon say, an Androginus ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He permits his wife to eat Terumah, but not Chazah v'Shok (the chest and foreleg of a Shelamim, which are given to Kohanim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He permits her to eat even Chazah v'Shok.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Reish Lakish permit her to eat Terumah, but not Chazah v'Shok? Both are forbidden mid'Oraisa to a Zar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He permits her to eat Terumah only nowadays, when it is only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he forbid her when the Mikdash stands and Terumah is mid'Oraisa? If so, why did he teach that she may not eat Chazah v'Shok? He should have distinguished within Terumah itself, that she may only eat Rabbinic Terumah, but not Terumah mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is what he taught! He permits her to eat Rabbinic Terumah nowadays, but not when there is Chazah v'Shok (i.e. when the Beis ha'Mikdash stands), even Rabbinic Terumah, lest she come to eat Terumah mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan (to Reish Lakish):</span> Do you hold that Terumah is only mid'Rabanan nowadays?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> Yes. I learn from a Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A ring (of pressed figs of Terumah that was mixed with rings of Chulin) becomes Batel (one may eat from the mixture. If Terumah (of grain) was mid'Oraisa, we would be stringent about all Terumah and say that something sold by number is not Batel!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> A piece (of a Korban that was mixed with other pieces) becomes Batel (even though it is an Isur mid'Oraisa)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do you think that the Mishnah (brought below) says '<i>All</i> that (i.e. even sometimes) is counted (is never Batel)'? The text is, '<i>That</i> which (always) is counted'!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT CAN BECOME <i>BATEL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> About which Mishnah do they argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Bundles of clover of Kil'ai ha'Kerem (crossbreeds in a vineyard) must be burned. If they became mixed with (permitted) bundles, all must be burned;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">81b----------------------------------------81b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, they are Batel if there are 201 bundles in all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir says, all that it is normally counted, forbids (it is never Batel);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim say, only six things are never Batel - nuts of Parech, pomegranates of Badan, sealed barrels (of wine), leeks, large stalks of cabbage, and Greek gourds;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Akiva adds a seventh, loaves of a homeowner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Some of these (the first three) are forbidden (the first three years of the tree) due to Orlah. The others are forbidden if they were Kil'ayim b'Kerem.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan says, the text (of R. Meir's words) is "That which is counted';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish says, it says 'All that is counted'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Beraisa about 'a piece'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a Tamei piece of a Chatas or of Lechem ha'Panim was mixed with 100 Tahor pieces, it is Batel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, it is not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Tahor piece of a Chatas or Lechem ha'Panim was mixed with 100 Tahor Chulin pieces, all agree that it is not Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish):</span> (Even though pieces are counted,) the Reisha teaches that it is Batel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya brei d'Rav Huna):</span> The case is, the piece was dissolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does R. Yehudah say that it is not Batel?</p>
