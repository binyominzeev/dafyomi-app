<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>PERMISSION OF <i>BEIS DIN</i> TO REMARRY (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that regarding a woman permitted by Beis Din, this is like rumors that started before Nisu'in (since there was doubt from the beginning, and she should be forbidden). He teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she was married according to Beis Din (... she is exempt from a Korban).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> Based on what was taught in the Beis Medrash, the Halachah does not follow the Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Medrash):</span> If Beis Din ruled that the sun set, and later it shone, this was a mistake, not a Hora'ah (ruling. Similarly, our Mishnah is a mistake, and not a Hora'ah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The case of our Mishnah is a Hora'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman, for himself):</span> In all of Torah, one witness is not believed, but here, he is believed. This is because it is a Hora'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It must be a mistake!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Beis Din permitted Chelev and blood, and later forbade them, if they again permit them (without a solid reason), we do not listen to them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Here, if we permitted her to remarry based on one witness, and then forbade her according to two witnesses, and then a witness came [and said that her husband subsequently died], we permit her!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Surely, it is because it was a mistake!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The law pierces the mountain, and she brings a fat Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it was a mistake, we understand why she brings a Korban. However, if it was a Hora'ah, why does she bring a Korban?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Eliezer obligates an individual who acted according to a (mistaken) Hora'ah of Beis Din to bring a Korban!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why did he say 'the law pierces the mountain'?! (This suggests that one might have thought differently. According to this suggestion, obviously she brings a Korban!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Beis Din ruled that she may remarry (and she was <i>Mekalkel</i>, she brings a Korban).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'Kilkelah' mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> She had Bi'as Zenus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> She married someone she is forbidden to, e.g. a widow married a Kohen Gadol, or a divorcee or Chalutzah married a regular Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Elazar says that she brings a Korban for Bi'as Zenus, all the more so she brings for a forbidden marriage;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yochanan exempts for Bi'as Zenus. She tells Beis Din 'you told me that I am single!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> If Beis Din ruled that she may remarry and she was Mekalkel, e.g. she married a Kohen Gadol, or she was a divorcee or Chalutzah and she married a regular Kohen, she must bring a Korban for every act of Bi'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Chachamim say, she only brings one Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Chachamim agree that if she married five men she must bring a Korban for each one, since they are separate bodies.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>FALSE TESTIMONY ABOUT A YEVAMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman's husband and their only son went overseas. They told her that her husband died and then her son died. She remarried. Later, they told her that her son died first (so she was Zekukah l'Yibum). She must leave her husband. Her children from him, both the first and last, are Mamzerim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If they told her (the first time) that her son died and then her husband, and she did Yibum, and later they told her that her husband died first, she must leave the Yavam. Her children from him, both the first and last, are Mamzerim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Witnesses told a woman that her husband died, and she remarried. Later they told her that he was alive when she remarried, but later he died. She must leave her husband, and her first children from him are Mamzerim. Later children are not Mamzerim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If witnesses told her that her husband died, and she became Mekudeshes, and later, her husband returned, she may return to him. Even if the second husband divorces her, she is permitted to Kehunah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Elazar ben Masya says "A woman divorced from her husband (is forbidden to a Kohen)", but not a woman divorced from a man who is not her husband.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does 'the first and last children' mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> First children are those before the latter report. Last are those after the latter report.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, the Mishnah should simply say that her children are Mamzerim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer and defence of Suggestion:</span> Indeed, it could have. Since the Seifa (c) distinguishes between the first and last children, also the Reisha mentions them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This Mishnah is R. Akiva, who says that Ein Kidushin Tofsin b'Chayavei Lavin. Chachamim say that a Mamzer does not result from a Yevamah who married a stranger (anyone other than her Yavam).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't it cite Chachamim to say that a Mamzer does not result from Chayavei Lavin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These Chachamim hold like R. Akiva according to a different Tana, who says that a Mamzer results from Chayavei Lavin only if they are of She'er (kin).</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DOES KIDUSHIN TAKE EFFECT WITH A YEVAMAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Lo SiHYeH Eshes ha'Mes Chutzah l'Ish Zar" - HavaYaH (Kidushin) does not take effect between a Yevamah and a foreign man.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Due to our ignorance, (if someone else was Mekadesh her) she needs a Get (to marry anyone else).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel is unsure whether "Lo Sihyeh" teaches (R. Tam - only) that this is a Lav, or (also) that Ein Kidushin Tofsin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> The Halachah follows Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> According to this, if her Yavam is a Kohen and she married Levi (a stranger), they do Chalitzah, and she is permitted to Levi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We should not allow him to profit from his sin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if her Yavam is a Yisrael, Levi gives her a Get, and she is permitted to her Yavam.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Ein Kidushin Tofsin with a Yevamah. Nisu'in takes effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Kidushin does not take effect, neither does Nisu'in!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, she has neither Kidushin nor Nisu'in.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> 'She has Nisu'in' like Rav Hamnuna taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> If a Shomeres Yavam had Bi'as Zenus she is forbidden to her Yavam.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Nisu'in takes effect to require a Get. This is a decree lest she be confused with a woman who remarried based on one (false) witness.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> They voted and concluded that Ein Kidushin Tofsin with a Yevamah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> A Mishnah teaches this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If David was Mekadesh a woman to take effect (when it will be possible, i.e.) after he or she converts or is freed, or after her husband dies, or after her sister (David's wife) dies, or after she will do Chalitzah, she is not Mekudeshes (even afterwards. If Kidushin Tofsin b'Yevamah, it would take effect.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yanai):</span> Correct! Had I not taught to you the law, you would not have seen that the Mishnah teaches it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish to R. Yochanan):</span> A great man praised you. If not, I would have said that the Mishnah is like R. Akiva, who says that Ein Kidushin Tofsin with Chayavei Lavin (but Chachamim say that Kidushin Tofsin b'Yevamah)!</p></div>
