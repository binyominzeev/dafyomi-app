<p class="dedicationbox">12th CYCLE DEDICATIONS<BR>&nbsp;<BR>YEVAMOS 50 - In loving memory of David J Mizrahi (David ben Adele), whose warmth and kindness made him loved by all. Your memory is with us always. By his brother in law, Michael M. Missry </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A PERSON'S ALLOTTED LIFESPAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Tana'im argue about "I will complete the number of your days":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "I will fulfill the number of your days" - these are the years apportioned to a person when he is born. If he merits, they are fulfilled. If not, they are reduced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, if he merits, they are increased. If not, they are reduced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> It says, "I will add 15 years to your days"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> The years added were allotted to him from before.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Support (R. Akiva, for himself):</span> It was prophesized "A son will be born to Beis David, his name will be Yoshiyahu". Menasheh (from whom Yoshiyahu descended) was born during Chizkiyahu's 15 'extra' years!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Chachamim):</span> The verse says that he will be born to the house of David, but it did not specify that he will descend from Chizkiyahu!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If his wife died... if his Yevamah died... (he may marry her sister).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> This Mishnah is not needed (the Heter is easily derived from a verse).</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK RABAN GAMLIEL</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ACQUISITIONS AND DISQUALIFICATION OF <i>YEVAMOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Gamliel):</span> If a Yavam gave a Get to his Yevamah, a second Get does not take effect (to forbid the giver to the receiver's relatives). A Ma'amar does not take effect after a Ma'amar, nor does Bi'ah take effect after Bi'ah, nor Chalitzah after Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, a Get takes effect after a Get and a Ma'amar takes effect after a Ma'amar, but nothing takes effect after Bi'ah or Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If a Yavam gave a Ma'amar to his Yevamah and then a Get, she needs Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he gave a Ma'amar then did Chalitzah, she needs a Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If he gave a Ma'amar and had Bi'ah, this is proper fulfillment of the Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If he gave a Get and then a Ma'amar, she needs a Get and Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If he gave a Get and had Bi'ah, she needs a Get and Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If he gave a Get and did Chalitzah, nothing is needed after Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If he did Chalitzah, then gave a Ma'amar or a Get or had Bi'ah; or, if he had Bi'ah, then gave a Ma'amar or a Get or did Chalitzah, nothing takes effect after Chalitzah. (We will ask (53b) why the Mishnah didn't also say that nothing takes effect after Bi'ah.).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">50b----------------------------------------50b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All this applies when there is one Yavam, whether there is one Yevamah or two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If he gave a Ma'amar to each Yevamah, each needs a Get, and Chalitzah must be done;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>If he gave a Ma'amar to one Yevamah and a Get to the other, the former needs a Get and Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If he gave a Ma'amar to one Yevamah, and had Bi'ah with the other, each needs a Get, and Chalitzah must be done;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>If he gave a Ma'amar to one Yevamah and did Chalitzah to the other, the former needs a Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>If he gave a Get to each, they need Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>If he gave a Get to one and had Bi'ah with the other, the latter needs a Get and Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>If he gave a Get to one and a Ma'amar to the other, the latter needs a Get and Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>If he gave a Get to one and did Chalitzah to the other, nothing takes effect after Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>If he did Chalitzah to both, or did Chalitzah to one and gave a Ma'amar or a Get or had Bi'ah with the other, or had Bi'ah with both, or had Bi'ah with one and gave a Ma'amar or a Get or did Chalitzah to the other, nothing takes effect after Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All this applies to one Yavam and two Yevamos, or two Yevamim and one Yevamah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>If he did Chalitzah and gave a Ma'amar or a Get or had Bi'ah, or, if he had Bi'ah and gave a Ma'amar or a Get or did Chalitzah, nothing takes effect after Chalitzah. (Here we return to discuss one Yevam and one Yevamah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is whether the Chalitzah was at the beginning, in the middle or at the end.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When Bi'ah is at the beginning, nothing takes effect after it. If Bi'ah is in the middle or at the end, things take effect after it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Nechemyah says, Bi'ah and Chalitzah are similar. Whether they are at the beginning, middle or end, nothing takes effect after them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHY <i>GET</i> AND <i>MA'AMAR </i>WERE ENACTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> They argue only about a Get after a Get or a Ma'amar after a Ma'amar, but all agree that a single Get or Ma'amar takes effect on a Yevamah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was Get enacted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Get permits a married woman; Chalitzah also permits a woman. If people see that Get does not affect a Yevamah, they will think that also Chalitzah does not affect her, and they will come to do Yibum after Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was Ma'amar enacted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ma'amar (i.e. money or a document give for Kidushin) acquires a single woman; Bi'ah also acquires. If people see that Ma'amar does not acquire a Yevamah, they will think that also Bi'ah does not acquire, and they will come to do Yibum after Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Chachamim say that Zikah remains after a Pasul Bi'ah (i.e. a forbidden Yibum)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> When Bi'ah is after a Get, this is a decree due to Yibum after Chalitzah (if we would say that no Zikah remains, people would think that it is a proper Yibum);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> When Bi'ah is after a Ma'amar, this is a decree due to Yibum after Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Chachamim say that no Zikah remains after a Pasul Chalitzah (i.e. it was forbidden to do Yibum)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is no reason to decree!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should decree about Chalitzah after a Get due to Chalitzah after Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There is no problem if people do extra Chalitzos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should decree about Chalitzah after a Ma'amar due to Chalitzah after Yibum (lest people think that after Yibum, the Yavam can dismiss her with Chalitzah alone).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> In this case, we require a Get for the Ma'amar. Also when Chalitzah is done after Yibum, people will give a Get!</p>
