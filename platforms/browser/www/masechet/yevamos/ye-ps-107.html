<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN MAY MI'UN BE DONE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> A girl (an orphaned minor married mid'Rabanan) can do Mi'un (retroactively undo the marriage) only during Eirusin;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Beis Hillel say, she can do so even after Nisu'in.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Beis Shamai say, Mi'un can be done to the husband, but not (after she fell) to a Yavam;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Beis Hillel say, she can do Mi'un even to a Yavam;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Beis Shamai say, Mi'un can be done only in front of the husband;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Beis Hillel say, it need not be in front of him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Beis Shamai say, Mi'un can be done only in Beis Din;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Beis Hillel say, it need not be in Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> A girl may do Mi'un four or five times.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> Benos Yisrael are not Hefker! Rather, she does Mi'un, waits until she grows up, does Mi'un, and gets married [to someone else].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MI'UN FROM NISU'IN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why do Beis Shamai forbid Mi'un from Nisu'in?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> Nisu'in cannot be on condition. If girls do Mi'un from Nisu'in, people will come to say that Nisu'in can be conditional.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why don't they allow Mi'un after Chupah without Bi'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chupah cannot be on condition.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why don't they allow Mi'un after her father handed her over to the husband's messengers?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim did not distinguish (between types of Nisu'in).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Hillel allow Mi'un from Nisu'in, for people know that Nisu'in of an orphaned minor is only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (a) - Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> Beis Shamai forbid Mi'un from Nisu'in because a person does not want to have Bi'as Zenus. (Men will not marry orphans if they may do Mi'un and retroactively convert the Bi'os to Bi'as Zenus.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why don't they allow Mi'un after Chupah without Bi'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A man does not want that his Chupah was forbidden (retroactively).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why don't they allow Mi'un after her father handed her over to the husband's messengers?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim did not distinguish (between types of Nisu'in).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, since there is Kidushin and a Kesuvah, people will not consider it to be Bi'as Zenus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel are both concerned for Peiros (yield of her property);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai hold, if she could do Mi'un, he would hastily eat the Peiros, since he expects her to leave and take back her property;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, the option to do Mi'un <i>encourages</i> him to improve the property, lest her relatives counsel her to do Mi'un!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> Beis Shamai hold that a person does not want to make a (wedding) party and lose it (if she does Mi'un);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Hillel hold that they are both happy to acquire the title of being married (even if the marriage will not endure).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MI'UN TO THE YAVAM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> She may do Mi'un to her husband (...Beis Hillel permit even to the Yavam).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> She may do Mi'un to (undo) his Ma'amar (so a Get is not needed), but not to his Zikah (to marry l'Shuk without Chalitzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Oshaya's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> A Ma'amar requires her consent, therefore she can uproot it. Zikah is against her will, so she cannot uproot it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Yibum is against her will, yet she can uproot it!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">107b----------------------------------------107b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Yavam does Ma'amar and Yibum, so she can uproot them. Shamayim put Zikah on her, so she cannot uproot it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> She can do Mi'un even to his Zikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because she uproots the first marriage.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If any Ervah (to the Yavam) could have done Mi'un but did not, the Tzarah does Chalitzah, but not Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Mi'un can uproot Zikah, she should do Mi'un now and the Tzarah can do Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tzaras Ervah is different for the following reason:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rami bar Yechezkel):</span> If a girl did Mi'un to her husband, she may marry his father. If she did Mi'un to the Yavam, she is forbidden to his father.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is because when she fell to Yibum, she looked like his daughter-in-law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Also in the Mishnah, when she fell to Yibum, the Tzarah looked like Tzaras Ervah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If she did Mi'un to one brother she is forbidden to all brothers, just like Ba'alas ha'Get (a Yevamah who received a Get);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since Ba'alas ha'Get is forbidden to the one who gave the Get, she is forbidden to all the brothers. The same applies when she does Mi'un to a Yavam!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If she did Mi'un to one brother, she is permitted to the others. She is unlike Ba'alas ha'Get;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Yavam did an action to Ba'alas ha'Get. Here, she acts on him and says that she does not want him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>She does not want him, but she desires his brother!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> If she did Mi'un to a brother, she is permitted even to him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Asi holds like R. Oshaya, who says that she cannot do Mi'un to uproot his Zikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. When there is only one Yavam, she can uproot the Zikah. The case is, there are two Yevamim. Mi'un does not work on half the Zikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span>  R. Yochanan taught that if she did Mi'un to one brother, she is permitted to the other brothers. They did not agree to this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who didn't agree to this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Rav did not agree.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #2 (Rava):</span> R. Oshaya did not agree. (R. Yochanan connotes that Mi'un does not uproot Zikah only when there are at least two brothers. R. Oshaya holds that it never uproots Zikah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rav Asi did not agree. (R. Yochanan connotes that she is permitted only to the other brothers.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MI'UN IN FRONT OF THE HUSBAND OR BEIS DIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Mi'un must be in front of the husband ...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Hillel):</span> The wife of Pishon the camel-driver did Mi'un in his absence!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> Since he acted unfairly (he squandered her Melug property), Chachamim were unfair to him (and let her do Mi'un in his absence)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since he ate Peiros of her property, she must have done Nisu'in. Beis Shamai do not allow Mi'un from Nisu'in!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim were unfair to him in two respects.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Mi'un must be in front of Beis Din ...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chalitzah and Mi'un must be in front of three.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who taught that Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> It is Beis Shamai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> It can even be Beis Hillel. Beis Hillel do not require a Beis Din of expert judges, but they require three!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> Mi'un must be in front of Beis Din;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, it need not be in front of Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Both agree that three are needed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yosi bar Yehudah and R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon say that with two, it is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef bar Minyomi):</span> The Halachah follows these two Tana'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> She does Mi'un ... (grows up, does Mi'un and gets married).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a second Mi'un needed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> When she grows up, she must say that she affirms her first Mi'un.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> Beis Shamai teach two options (that prevent her from doing Mi'un again):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>She may do Mi'un, grow up and become Mekudeshes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>She may do Mi'un and immediately have Nisu'in.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Ula, we understand why it says 'until she grows up, <i>does Mi'un</i>, and gets married';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, according to Shmuel, it should say, 'until she grows up, <i>says</i>...'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>WHICH GIRLS MUST DO MI'UN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any girl married by her mother and brothers with her consent must do Mi'un. If she was married against her will, she need not do Mi'un;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Chanina ben Antigonus says, any girl too immature to guard her Kidushin money need not do Mi'un;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, the actions of a minor have no effect. She is like one who was enticed (to have Bi'ah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If she is a Bas Yisrael married to a Kohen, she does not eat Terumah. If she is a Bas Kohen married to a Yisrael, she may eat Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, if the husband is the hindrance (this will be explained), it is as if she is his wife. If he is not the hindrance, it is as if she is not his wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> At first, the text of a document of Mi'un used to say 'I do not want him, I do not desire him, and I do not want to be married to him';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim saw that the text was too long and people might confuse it with a Get. They enacted to write 'On day Ploni, Plonis did Mi'un in front of us.'</p></div>
