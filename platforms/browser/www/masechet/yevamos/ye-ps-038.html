<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>INHERITANCE IN CASES OF DOUBT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> R. Yirmeyah's law is even like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim favor the neighbor's claim because he could return the deeds. The Yavam's children have no such option.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Safek and Shimon (the Yavam) came to inherit Yakov, the father of Reuven and Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The Safek:</span> I am Reuven's son, so I receive half.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> You are my son, so you receive nothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Verdict:</span> The Yavam definitely inherits (at least part); it is doubtful whether or not the Safek inherits. We do not take from one who has a Vadai claim to give to one with a Safek claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Safek and Shimon's sons came to inherit Yakov (after Shimon died. We discuss when Reuven and Shimon are Yakov's only sons, and Shimon has two Vadai sons, and none of these is four was a firstborn.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The Safek:</span> I am Reuven's son, so I receive half.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shimon's sons:</span> You are our brother, so you receive only a share with us.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Verdict:</span> The Safek admits that half belongs to Shimon's sons, so they split it among themselves. Shimon's sons admit that the Safek receives a third; he takes it. The remaining sixth is Safek, so they split it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Yakov and Shimon came to inherit the Safek, or Yakov and the Safek come to inherit Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Verdict:</span> The money is in doubt, so they split it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A <i>YEVAMAH</i> WHO INHERITED PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If property fell to a Yevamah, Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that she may sell it, and the sale is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she died, what do we do with her Kesuvah and the property that enters and leaves the marriage with her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beis Shamai):</span> Her husband's heirs split it with her father's heirs;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beis Hillel):</span> The property retains its status quo. The Kesuvah stays by the husband's heirs, and property that enters and leaves with her stays by her father's heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If she does Yibum, she is like his wife in all respects, but the Kesuvah is paid from the property of the deceased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why do Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree in the Reisha but not in the Seifa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> In the Reisha, she fell to Yibum from Kidushin. In the Seifa, she fell from Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ula holds that Zikah (of one who fell) from Kidushin is like Safek Kidushin, and Zikah from Nisu'in is like Safek Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">38b----------------------------------------38b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Zikah from Kidushin is only like Safek Kidushin. If it would be like Vadai Kidushin, Beis Hillel would not permit her to sell!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If property fell to an Arusah, she may sell it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Beis Hillel say, she may not sell it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Both agree that if she sold it, the sale stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Zikah from Nisu'in is only like Safek Nisu'in. If it would be like Vadai Nisu'in, Beis Shamai would not say that the father's heirs split her property!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If property fell to her after Nisu'in, Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that if she sold, the husband takes the property from the buyers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah):</span> If so, rather than arguing about the property itself after she dies, they should argue about who eats the Peiros during her lifetime!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> In both cases, she fell from Nisu'in. Zikah from Nisu'in makes Safek Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Reisha she is alive. She is Vadai (the property itself is hers) and the husband is Safek (perhaps he does not receive even Peiros), so a Safek does not take from a Vadai;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the Seifa she died and both heirs come to inherit, so they divide.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Beis Shamai hold that a Safek can take from a Vadai!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A house fell on Reuven and his father Yakov (or another relative whom Reuven inherits). Reuven owed money to pay a Kesuvah or creditors. Yakov's heirs say that Reuven died before Yakov (so Yakov's property never came to Reuven, so the Kesuvah or debt cannot be collected from it). The creditor says that Yakov died first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Shamai say, they divide;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Beis Hillel say, the property remains in its status quo.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Yakov's heirs are Vadai, and the creditor is Safek, and Beis Shamai say that they divide!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Shamai consider a document to be as if it was already collected.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If the husband died before the Sotah drank, she receives her Kesuvah and does not drink;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel say, she drinks or does not receive her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> She cannot drink, for we require "the man will bring his wife"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, since she does not drink, she does not receive her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> There is a Safek whether she was Mezaneh [and forfeited her Kesuvah], and she receives her Kesuvah (from the heirs, who definitely inherit)! This shows that Beis Shamai consider a document to be already collected.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Abaye ask from this Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One could say that a Kesuvah is different. Chachamim enacted that she can collect it mi'Safek, to encourage women to marry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he ask from the case of Kesuvah in our Mishnah? (Since she already died, the reason cannot be to encourage women to marry!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Shamai do not argue (about the Kesuvah, i.e. the 200 Zuz that the husband must pay if she will be widowed or divorced).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> They do argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Her Kesuvah and property that enters and leaves with her... Beis Shamai says, heirs of the husband divide with heirs of the father;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel say, the property stays in its status quo.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah asked what we do with the Kesuvah, and never answered. Beis Shamai say that heirs of the husband divide with heirs of the father the property that enters and leaves with her, and Beis Hillel say that the property stays in its status quo.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> Heirs of the husband divide with heirs of the father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This connotes that the property was the father's. If it referred to the Kesuvah (which was the husband's), it would have said 'heirs of the father divide with heirs of the husband.'</p>
