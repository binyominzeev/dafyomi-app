<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CAN ONE BE CONVERTED AGAINST HIS WILL?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Shimon ben Elazar learns from "Kol Eved Ish (any slave of a man... you will circumcise him)".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely this applies also to the slave of a woman!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, you may circumcise Eved Ish (a male slave) against his will, but not Ben Ish (a Nochri) against his will.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Chachamim say that just like you cannot circumcise a Nochri against his will, you cannot circumcise a slave against his will.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they learn from "Kol Eved Ish"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn Shmuel's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one made his slave Hefker (ownerless), the slave goes free, and does not need a Get Shichrur (document of freedom).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Kol Eved Ish" - one is a slave only if he has a master.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Chachamim said only their law regarding a Yefas To'ar, since she is not yet commanded in Mitzvos. A slave is already commanded in Mitzvos, so they would agree that one may circumcise him against his will!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The law of a convert is like the law of a slave bought from a Nochri: he must accept the Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A slave bought from a Yisrael need not accept the Mitzvos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Beraisa is like R. Shimon ben Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He says that even a slave bought from a Nochri need not accept the Mitzvos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Rather, it is Chachamim. This shows that they say that a slave bought from a Nochri must accept, but not a slave bought from a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa (47b) equated a convert to a freed slave (he need not accept)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question 4:f, 47b):</span> No, they are the same regarding Tevilah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>AN ESHES YEFAS TO'AR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> "She will shave her head and do her nails" - she cuts her nails;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Akiva says, she lets them grow long.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah commands about her head and nails. R. Eliezer says, just like she removes (her hair) from her head, she removes her nails;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, just like she does something to her head to make herself repulsive, also regarding her nails.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Eliezer):</span> "Mefivoshes... did not do his legs nor his mustache" - 'doing' refers to removing (the toenails or hair)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> "She will cry over her father and mother" - this is literally true;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Akiva says, this refers to idolatry - "they say to (an idol of) wood 'you are my father.'"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>"A month of days" - this is 30 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, it is 90 days. "Month" is 30 days, "days" are 30, "after this" is another 30.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> We should say that "month" is 30, "days" are 30, "after this" is another 60 (corresponding to what was mentioned above)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A SLAVE WHO REFUSES TO BE CIRCUMCISED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> One may keep slaves who refuse to be circumcised;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Akiva says, we may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> It says, "The son of your slave will rest!" (This will be explained.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> That refers to one who bought a slave Bein ha'Shemashos (when Shabbos was entering) and did not have time to circumcise him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> All agree that the verse discusses an Arel (uncircumcised) slave. How do they know this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "The son of your slave will rest" refers to an Arel slave. (Tosfos - he may not do Melachah on Shabbos for the sake of a Yisrael.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it refers to a circumcised slave!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "In order that your male and female slave will rest like yourself" teaches about circumcised slaves. We must say that the other verse discusses an Arel slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>"And the Ger" refers to a Ger Toshav (a Nochri who keeps his seven Mitzvos; he may live among us in Eretz Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it refers to a convert!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "The Ger in your gates" refers to a convert, so the other verse must refer to a Ger Toshav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If one bought a slave from a Nochri and the slave refuses to be circumcised, one may keep him for 12 months. If he still refuses, he must be sold to a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> This is unlike R. Akiva, who forbids keeping him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> It can be even like R. Akiva. R. Akiva forbids keeping a slave without Pasak (he never agreed to be circumcised. Alternatively, he did not stipulate to sell him if he will not circumcise within a year). If he agreed (and later retracted), R. Akiva could agree that we wait 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Zvid):</span> If so, why did R. Akiva say that the verse discusses a slave bought Bein ha'Shemashos? He should have said that it discusses a case of Pasak!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He gave one of two possible answers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> One may keep an Arel slave only if he bought him on condition not to circumcise him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> This is unlike R. Akiva, who forbids keeping him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> It may be even like R. Akiva. R. Akiva forbids when there was no stipulation not to circumcise him. If he stipulated, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Zvid):</span> If so, why did R. Akiva said that the verse discusses a slave bought Bein ha'Shemashos? He should have said that it discusses a slave bought without intent to circumcise him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> How will you explain why he didn't say that it discusses a case of Pasak?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> You must also say that R. Akiva gave one of two or three possible answers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanina bar Papi, R. Ami, and R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> There was a city in Eretz Yisrael whose slaves did not want to be circumcised. They kept them for 12 months, then sold them to Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>This is like the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one bought a slave from a Nochri and he did not agree to be circumcised, one keeps him for 12 months. If he is still Arel, he is sold to a Nochri;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, in Eretz Yisrael we do not let him stay so long lest he spoil Taharos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>In a city on the border he may not be kept even a short time, lest he hear something and tell his Nochri friend.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHY CONVERTS SUFFER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chananyah):</span> Nowadays converts suffer because they did not keep the Mitzvos of Bnei No'ach before converting;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, a convert is like a newborn (he is not punished for what he did before)! Rather, converts suffer because they are not meticulous in the Mitzvos like Yisraelim are;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Aba Chanan says, it is because they serve out of fear, and not out of love;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Others say, it is because they delayed coming under Kanfei ha'Shechinah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Others learn from "Hash-m will pay your actions, and your wages will be full from Hash-m (because you (Rus) did not delay to convert)".</p>
