<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if Reuven had Bi'ah b'Mezid with Achos Ishto, Reuven is not forbidden to his wife (Leah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Osah" - Leah is forbidden through her own Bi'ah (with a man other than her husband), but not through Bi'ah of her sister (with Reuven).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If not for the verse, we would have learned a Kal va'Chomer:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In a light Isur Bi'ah (Eshes Ish), the Oser (one who forbids, i.e. her husband forbids her to all men) becomes forbidden. All the more so, in a severe Isur Bi'ah (Achos Ishto), the Oser (Leah, who forbids her sister to Reuven) should become forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that one who has Bi'ah with Chamoso (his mother-in-law) becomes forbidden to his wife. They argue only about Bi'ah with Achos Ishto;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai say, this forbids his wife;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yosi says, Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that one that has Bi'ah with Achos Ishto permitted to his wife. They argue only about Bi'ah with Chamoso:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai say, this forbids his wife;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(Bi'ah with Achos Ishto does not forbid because) initially, Reuven was permitted to all women, and Leah was permitted to all men. After he was Mekadesh her, he forbids her and she forbids him:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He forbids her more than she forbids him. He forbids her to all men in the world, and she only forbids him on her relatives.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>We learn from a Kal va'Chomer. He forbids her to all men, yet Bi'ah b'Shogeg with someone forbidden to her does not forbid her to (her husband, to) whom she was permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>She forbids him only to her relatives. All the more so Bi'ah b'Shogeg with someone forbidden to him does not forbid him to one to whom he was permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about Shogeg. What is the source if he sinned b'Mezid?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Osah" - she is forbidden through her own Bi'ah, but not through Bi'ah of her sister.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish) Question:</span> "You will burn he and them" - do we burn everyone (even his wife, who did not sin)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse cannot teach that she is burned. Rather, it teaches that she is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>A man had Bi'ah with his mother-in-law; Rav Yehudah lashed him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Had Shmuel not taught that the Halachah does not follow R. Yehudah, I would forbid you to your wife permanently.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ESHES ISH IS A LIGHT ISUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa (1:c:1) mentioned a light Isur. What is it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is Machazir Gerushaso after Nisu'in with another man;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When the latter husband had Bi'ah with her, this forbade her to the first husband. When the first remarried her and had Bi'ah with her (after the second divorced her), he forbade her to the second (the second transgresses Machazir Gerushaso if he remarries her).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One cannot learn a Kal va'Chomer from Machazir Gerushaso (to say that Bi'ah with Achos Ishto forbids Ishto), for Machazir Gerushaso is more stringent:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Her body was defiled;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Isur can come through any man (Tosfos. Rashi deletes this from the text);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Isur is permanent (but Achos Ishto is permitted after Ishto dies).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> It is a Yevamah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To whom is the Isur?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is to a stranger, like Rav Hamnuna taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> If a Shomeres Yavam had Bi'as Zenus she is forbidden to her Yavam.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One cannot learn a Kal va'Chomer from a Yevamah who had Bi'as Zenus. That case is more stringent (than Achos Ishto):</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Her body was defiled;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The Isur applies to all men.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is a Yevamah forbidden to the brothers:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If Reuven gave to her a Ma'amar, he forbids her to the other brothers. If Shimon then had Bi'ah with her, he forbids her to Reuven.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Beraisa say that Bi'ah with the light Isur (forbids the Oser)? Even if Shimon gave to her a Ma'amar, he forbids her to Reuven!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is R. Gamliel, who says that a Ma'amar does not take effect after a Ma'amar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Still, Shimon can forbid her through giving her a Get or doing Chalitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is a Sotah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To whom is the Isur?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is to her husband.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Why does the Beraisa say that Bi'ah with the light Isur forbids (the Bo'el (suspected adulterer), who forbade her to her husband)? Even if her husband divorced her, or said that he will not give her to drink, she is (permanently) forbidden to the Bo'el!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Isur is to the Bo'el.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is not a light Isur. It is the severe Isur of Eshes Ish!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">95b----------------------------------------95b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> It is an Eshes Ish.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this called a light Isur?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Oser does not forbid her his entire life.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support - (Beraisa - Aba Chanan) Suggestion:</span> Eshes Ish is a light Isur, for the Oser does not forbid her his entire life. One who has Bi'ah with her forbids her to the Oser. If one has Bi'ah with a severe Isur, in which the Oser forbids her his entire life, all the more so he should forbid her!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Osah" - Bi'as Zenus of an Eshes Ish (Leah) forbids her, but Bi'ah of Leah's sister (with Leah's husband) does not forbid Leah (to her husband).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>R. YOSI'S OPINION IN THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> Anyone who forbids others forbids to himself. Anyone who does not forbid others does not forbid to himself (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The first Tana said that if Reuven's wife Leah and Giso (David, the husband of Leah's sister Rachel) went overseas (and we heard that they died and Reuven married Rachel), David's wife becomes forbidden to David, and Reuven's wife is permitted (to Reuven). R. Yosi says, just like Reuven's wife is permitted, David's wife is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he should have said 'anyone who does not forbid to himself does not forbid to others', and not 'anyone who does not forbid others does not forbid to himself'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, just like his (David's) wife is forbidden, also Reuven's wife is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This explains 'anyone who forbids to others forbids to himself'. How do we explain 'anyone who does not forbid to others does not forbid to himself'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ami):</span> This refers to the Reisha (87b). A woman who married according to Beis Din must leave her husband, and she is exempt from a Korban. If she married based on (two) witnesses, she must leave (her new husband, but she is permitted to her first husband), and she must bring a Korban. Great is the power of Beis Din that exempts her from a Korban;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana says, whether Reuven married Achos Ishto based on witnesses [that her husband died] and she remains permitted to her husband; or whether he married her according to Beis Din, and she is forbidden to her husband, Reuven remains permitted to his wife;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, when he married her according to Beis Din he forbids others, and he also forbids his own wife on himself. When he married based on witnesses he does not forbid others, and he does not forbid to himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> It refers to the Seifa. R. Yosi distinguishes between when Leah was Mekudeshes to Reuven and when she was Nesu'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana says, whether there was Kidushin or Nisu'in, Rachel is forbidden (to David) and Leah is permitted to Reuven;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, if there was Nisu'in, we are not concerned lest people say that Leah's Nisu'in was on condition. (It is clear that the marriage to Rachel was a mistake, so) he does not forbid to others (people will not say that Rachel was divorced, married Reuven, and now remarries David), and he does not forbid his wife to himself;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If there was Kidushin, we are concerned lest people say that Leah's Kidushin was on condition (and it was not fulfilled, and Reuven truly married her after David divorced her), he forbids to others (David), he even forbids to himself (Leah looks like Achos Gerushaso).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> Did Shmuel really say that?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A Yevamah is like an Eshes Ish;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> She is not like an Eshes Ish.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The case is, Reuven was Mekadesh a woman and went overseas. His brother Shimon heard that Reuven died, and married her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rav says that she is like an Eshes Ish, and she is forbidden to Reuven. Shmuel says that she is not like an Eshes Ish, and is permitted to Reuven.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>(Shmuel is not concerned lest people say that Reuven's Kidushin was conditional, and Shimon properly married her, and now Reuven marries Eshes Ach!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Shmuel ruled like R. Yosi, but he did not say that he explains the argument like R. Yitzchak Nafcha. Perhaps he explains like R. Ami!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Even if he explains like R. Yitzchak, perhaps he rules like R. Yosi regarding 'anyone who does not forbid', but not regarding 'anyone who forbids'!</p></div>
