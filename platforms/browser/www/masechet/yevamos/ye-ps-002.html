<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ARAYOS THAT UPROOT YIBUM AND CHALITZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Normally, if Reuven died without children, one of his brothers must do Yibum (Levirate marriage) or Chalitzah with one of the widows). If a widow (Esther) is forbidden to a brother (Shimon) by one of the 15 Arayos (forbidden incestuous relationships) listed below, she and all her Tzaros (co-wives) are exempt from (and cannot do) Yibum or Chalitzah with him. (If there is no brother with whom they can do Yibum or Chalitzah, they are permitted to marry strangers.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If Levi (another brother) did Yibum with Miryam (a Tzarah of Esther) and then he died (childless), all Levi's widows are exempt from Yibum or Chalitzah with Shimon. (Miryam's Tzaros are Tzaros of the Tzarah of Esther.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The same applies if another brother then did Yibum with a widow of Levi and then died childless, ad infinitum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The 15 Arayos are:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shimon's daughter;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The daughter of his daughter;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The daughter of his son;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The daughter of Shimon's wife;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The daughter of the son of his wife;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>The daughter of the daughter of his wife;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>His mother-in-law;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>The mother of his mother-in-law</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>The mother of his father-in-law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p>His maternal sister.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p>His mother's sister;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p>His wife's sister;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p>The wife of his maternal brother;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p>Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo (the widow of a brother of Shimon who died before Shimon was born).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">15.</span><p>Shimon's daughter-in-law.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If any of these died, did Mi'un (annulled a mid'Rabanan marriage), was divorced, or was found to be an Ailonis (a girl who does not develop like a normal female), the Tzaros are permitted (i.e. obligated to do Yibum or Chalitzah with Shimon or another brother).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mi'un and being found to be an Ailonis do not apply to the mother and grandmothers of Shimon's wife. (Mi'un must be before adulthood, and a minor cannot give birth. An Ailonis is sterile.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>EXEMPTING THE TZAROS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> We illustrate the case of Tzaros of a Tzarah. If Shimon's daughter (or any of the other 14 Arayos) Esther was married to Reuven, and Reuven died, just like Esther is exempt (from Yibum with Shimon), so is her Tzarah (Miryam).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If Miryam married (i.e. did Yibum) with Levi, the husband of Tamar, and Levi died, just like Miryam is exempt from Yibum with Shimon, so is Tamar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This applies even 100 times (a widow does Yibum, and the Yavam dies, his other wives are exempt from Yibum with Shimon).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah said that if she died, the Tzaros are permitted. What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shimon's daughter (or another Ervah) Esther was married to Reuven, who had another wife Miryam. If Shimon's daughter died or was divorced, and then Reuven died, Reuven's other wife may do Yibum with Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If Shimon's daughter could have done Mi'un but didn't, the Tzarah may do Chalitzah (with Shimon) but not Yibum (with him).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ORDER OF THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (Later in our Sugya) we learn all Arayos in the Mishnah from Achos Ishto (his wife's sister). That case should have been taught first!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah lists the most severe cases first.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We would have to say that the Tana holds like R. Shimon, who says that Sereifah (death by burning) is harsher than stoning.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> If so, the Tana should have taught Chamoso (his mother-in-law) first, for the Torah writes Sereifah regarding Chamoso, and from it we learn Sereifah for other Arayos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> If so, his daughter-in-law should follow Chamoso, since (R. Shimon holds that) stoning is the harshest punishment next to burning!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Bito (his daughter) was taught first, because it is not explicit in the Torah. The Tana needed to expound it, therefore he prefers it.</p></div>
