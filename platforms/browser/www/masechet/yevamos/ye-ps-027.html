<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CHALITZAH PESULAH (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One brother may do Chalitzah to all of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel requires a proper Chalitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If (two sisters, each with a Tzarah, fell from two brothers to one surviving brother and) he did Chalitzah to the sisters, their Tzaros are not exempted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If (here) Shimon could do proper Chalitzah (i.e. after Reuven did Chalitzah with the first sister), is it enough for Reuven to do Chalitzah Pesulah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Shmuel teaches that one does Chalitzah to all of them, i.e. to the first and third.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He said 'to all of them'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he does Chalitzah to the majority, this is called all of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (b)):</span> Shmuel requires proper Chalitzah only to exempt the Tzarah, but the Choletzes herself is exempted in any case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> (In the above case when sisters with Tzaros fell to one brother), if he did Chalitzah to the sisters, the Tzaros are not exempted. If he did Chalitzah to the Tzaros, the sisters are exempted;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>(If Tzaros fell to a Yavam and he gave a Get or Ma'amar to one,) if he did Chalitzah to the Yevamah who received a Get or Ma'amar, her Tzarah is not exempted;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>If he did Chalitzah to the Tzarah, the Yevamah who received a Get or Ma'amar is exempted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When he does Chalitzah to the sisters, the Tzaros are not exempted because the Chalitzah is Pesulah. Through Zikah, each sister is like Achos Ishto;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Also when he does Chalitzah to the Tzaros the sisters should not be exempted, because through Zikah each is the Tzarah of Achos Ishto!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Shmuel holds that Ein Zikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Shmuel (18b) taught that Yesh Zikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here Shmuel teaches according to the opinion that Ein Zikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, when he does Chalitzah to the sisters (Leah and then Rachel), why aren't the Tzaros exempted?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Granted, Rachel's Tzarah is not exempted. Since he already did Chalitzah to Leah, Rachel's Chalitzah is Pesulah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>However, Leah's Chalitzah was valid, so her Tzarah should be exempted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, she is exempted! Shmuel said that the Tzaros are not exempted, i.e. Rachel's Tzarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He said 'the Tzaros (plural)'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In all such cases, Rachel's Tzarah is not exempted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so ('does not exempt' means that only one is exempted), when he says that Chalitzah of the Tzaros (e.g. Leah's and then Rachel's) exempts the sisters, he must mean both sisters. However Rachel is not exempted through her Tzarah's Chalitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man is forbidden to the Tzarah of the relative of his Chalutzah (the woman he did Chalitzah with. Therefore, the Chalitzah of Rachel's Tzarah is Pesulah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel taught that if he started doing Chalitzah with (one of) the sisters, he does not finish with the Tzaros (it is not enough to do Chalitzah to her sister's Tzarah), because a Mishnah forbids a man to Tzaras Krovas Chalutzaso;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>If he started doing Chalitzah with (one of) the Tzaros (e.g. Leah's), he may finish even with the sisters (i.e. Rachel), because a Mishnah teaches that a man is permitted to Krovas Tzaras Chalutzaso.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> We need not change Shmuel's words. (When he does Chalitzah to the sisters, no Tzarah is exempted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Even though Yesh Zikah,) the Chalitzah of Rachel's Tzarah is considered a proper Chalitzah, since Zikah is not so strong to make the Tzarah like Ervah. (Chachamim decreed only about Achos Zekukaso.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If he did Chalitzah to the sisters, the Tzaros are not exempted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Chalitzah to the Tzaros would exempt the sisters.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is because Yesh Zikah, but Zikah is not so strong to make the Tzarah like Ervah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Aba bar Mamal):</span> The Beraisa is like Beis Shamai.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Shamai permit the Tzaros to the brothers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even Yibum should be allowed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Yochanan ben Nuri, who suggested that we enact that all Tzaros do Chalitzah but not Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We learned that they were not able to enact this in time!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Later, it was enacted.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TO WHICH YEVAMAH SHOULD CHALITZAH BE DONE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one Yevamah received a Get and another received a Ma'amar, which Chalitzah is better (to exempt the other)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps (Chalitzah of) the recipient of the Get is better, since she started being cast off;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps the recipient of the Ma'amar is preferable, since she is closer to doing Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> R. Gamliel agrees that a Get takes effect after a Ma'amar, and a Ma'amar after a Get.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Get were more potent, a Ma'amar would not take effect after it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a Ma'amar were more potent, a Get would not take effect after it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that they are equal. (Rashi - either exempts the other; Ramban - neither exempts the other; Tosfsos - according to Rav Ashi above, either exempts)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Rachel fell to Yibum to Levi and then Leah fell to him and he did Chalitzah to one of them, she is permitted. If he then did Chalitzah to the other, she is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If (Chalitzah was not done and) Rachel died, Leah is permitted to him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All the more so, if Leah died, Rachel is permitted, for she is a Yevamah who was permitted, became forbidden, and the Isur went away, so she is permitted again.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If Leah died, Rachel is permitted. If Rachel died, Leah is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Any Yevamah whom we cannot apply "Yevamah Yavo Aleha" when she fell to Yibum (i.e. she was forbidden) is like the widow of a brother who had children (she may never do Yibum).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav agrees with this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If we cannot apply "Yevamah Yavo Aleha" to a Yevamah when she falls to Yibum, she is like the widow of a brother who had children.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav said this only regarding the Isur mid'Oraisa of Achos Ishto. Regarding Zikah mid'Rabanan, we are not stringent.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CAN WE EXPLAIN OUR MISHNAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi bar Chanina - Mishnah):</span> If two of four brothers were married to sisters, and the two died, the sisters do Chalitzah, not Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We should tell one brother do Chalitzah with the second sister to fall. The first Yevamah was permitted, forbidden and permitted again, so she may do Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> I do not know who taught that Mishnah (it is not a valid Mishnah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah means that one does Chalitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says '<i>Choltzos</i>' (plural).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this alludes to all such cases (the second sister to fall does Chalitzah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says <i>these</i> do Chalitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it discusses when the first to fall did Chalitzah first!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Mishnah says that they do Chalitzah, i.e. l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
