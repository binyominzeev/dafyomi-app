<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE TESTIMONY OF <i>YEVAMOS</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is R. Elazar's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he hold that Leah's testimony [always] helps for her Tzarah Sarah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does he hold that Leah would not ruin herself (do Yibum if her husband were alive) to ruin Sarah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>These answers disagree about whether or not Sarah may remarry before Leah:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Leah's testimony helps for her Sarah, Sarah may remarry first;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If Sarah is permitted only because Leah would not ruin herself, Sarah may not remarry before Leah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> Since they were permitted to the Yevamim, they are permitted to others.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Sarah is permitted because Leah would not ruin herself, we understand why Sarah is permitted only after Leah remarries;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if Leah's testimony helps for Sarah, it should help even if Leah didn't marry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The reason is because Leah would not ruin herself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, perhaps R. Elazar addresses Chachamim according to their opinion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I hold that Leah's testimony helps for Sarah, even if Leah didn't remarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>You should at least agree that if Leah remarried Sarah may remarry, for Leah would not ruin herself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> A woman would ruin herself to ruin her Tzarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> If a woman went overseas with her husband and returned and said that he died, she may remarry and she receives her Kesuvah. Her Tzarah is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> Since she was permitted, her Tzarah is also permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Elazar means that since she was permitted and remarried, her Tzarah is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest she remarried because she was divorced, but her ex-husband is still alive, and she lies to ruin her Tzarah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tzarah is permitted only if Leah married a Kohen. She would not do so if she was divorced.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT MUST BE SEEN TO TESTIFY THAT A MAN DIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Witnesses can testify only if they saw the face, including the nose. This is even if there are Simanim on his body and clothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>They can testify only if they saw him die. This is even if they saw him cut up, hanging, and a wild animal eating him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They can testify only if they saw the body within three days of death;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah ben Bava says, it depends on the deceased, the place and the time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If they only saw the forehead but not the face, or vice-versa, they cannot testify. They must see both, including the nose.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We learn from "Hakaras Peneihem Onsah Bam".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Aba bar Marsa owed money to the Exilarch's house. He stuck remnants of garments on his forehead, and they did not recognize him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even if there are Simanim ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This shows that mid'Oraisa we may not rely on Simanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If (a messenger to give a Get lost the Get, and) it was found tied to his wallet or ring, or if it was found among his clothes, even after a long time, the Get may be used.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not mid'Oraisa we may rely on Simanim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may not identify a dead man based on a wart to permit his wife to remarry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer ben Mahavoy permits this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim hold that we may rely on Simanim mid'Oraisa; R. Eliezer says, it is only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rejection (Rava):</span> All hold that Simanim are mid'Oraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1a:</span> They argue about whether we are concerned lest someone born at the same time with the same Mazel has an identical wart.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1b:</span> They argue about whether or not warts are prone to change after death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rejection (Rava):</span> All hold that (regular) Simanim are mid'Rabanan. They argue about whether or not a wart is an exceptional Siman (which works mid'Oraisa).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">120b----------------------------------------120b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In Version #1, Rava says that Simanim are mid'Oraisa. However, the Mishnah says (that witnesses can testify only if they saw the face) even if there are Simanim on his body and clothes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> The Simanim on his body are (vague and unreliable, e.g.) he is tall or short;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 - part 2 (regarding clothing):</span> We cannot rely on Simanim on his clothing, for we are concerned lest someone borrowed his clothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we are concerned that someone borrowed his clothing, why do we return a donkey based on a sign on the Ukaf (wood placed above the saddle)? We should be concerned lest the Ukaf was borrowed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One does not borrow another's Ukaf, lest it wound his donkey.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Get was found tied to a man's wallet or ring, why may it be used? Perhaps it is a different Get of one who borrowed his wallet or ring!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One does not lend his (signet) ring, lest the borrower forge (make an identical ring) with it. One does not lend his wallet, lest it harm his Mazel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 - part 2 (regarding clothing):</span> The Simanim on his clothes are (vague and unreliable, e.g.) they are white or black.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO WAS CUT UP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even if they saw that he was cut up ... (they cannot testify).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A cut up person may live.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> A person is not Tamei until he dies, even if he is cut up, even Goses (about to die).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He is not dead, but he will not live!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Tana'im argue about whether he can survive:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We can testify that a cut up person died, but not one who was hanging;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, we cannot testify even about one who was cut up, since he could be cauterized and live.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Mishnah cannot be R. Shimon ben Elazar, for the Seifa is unlike him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in Asya in which a man was lowered into water. When they lifted him, only his leg came up. Chachamim ruled that his wife may remarry only if above the knee came up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different, for water aggravates the wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah bar bar Chanah saw a man cut up his camel. It died while still neighing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> That was a weak camel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah discusses one cut with a burning-hot knife. All agree that in such a case he can live.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A wild animal was eating from him...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is only if it was eating from a place where a person does not die. If it was eating from a place from where a person dies, we may testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If both Simanim (foodpipe and windpipe) of a man were cut, or the majority of both, and he fled, we may testify that he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yehudah said that if such a man authorized to divorce his wife, we write and give the Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is living, but he will die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, one who cut the Simanim of a person b'Shogeg should be exiled, but a Beraisa says that he is not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Oshaya):</span> We are concerned that the wind precipitated his death, or he himself did [through quivering].</p>
