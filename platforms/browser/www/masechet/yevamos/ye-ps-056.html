<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHICH ASPECTS OF YIBUM REQUIRE PROPER BI'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Whether the Yavam was Shogeg or Mezid...) whether he did Ha'ara'ah or full Bi'ah, he acquired her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (If one did Yibum without intent,) regarding what does he acquire?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #	1 (Rav):</span> He acquires in all respects.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> He acquires only regarding what is written in the Parashah, i.e. to inherit his brother and to exempt her from Yibum (if he dies with children).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> If she fell to Yibum from Nisu'in, all agree that she eats (Terumah), since she ate before. They argue about when she fell from Kidushin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav says that she eats, since the Torah considers Bi'as Shogeg like Mezid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Shmuel says, it is considered Bi'ah to make the Yavam like the deceased husband, but not to make him stronger!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This is consistent with another teaching of Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Yavam permits her to eat (Terumah, through substandard Bi'ah) only if the deceased husband permitted her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen was Mekadesh a Bas Yisrael and he became deaf before Nisu'in, she does not eat. If he died and she fell to Yibum to a deaf brother, she eats. In this case the Yavam is stronger than the first husband.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like Rav and unlike Shmuel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means, if he did not do Nisu'in before he became deaf, she does not eat. If he did Nisu'in and then became deaf, she eats. If he died and she fell to Yibum to a deaf brother, she eats.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say 'in this case...'? (Also a deaf husband permits her!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If her husband was deaf from the beginning, he would not permit her. The Yavam permits her even if he was always deaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> If she fell to Yibum from Kidushin, all agree that she does not eat, since she did not eat in the life of her husband. They argue about when she fell from Nisu'in;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav says that she eats, since she ate before.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Shmuel says, the Torah considers Bi'as Shogeg like Mezid only regarding things written in the Parashah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Shmuel):</span> Whenever the deceased husband permitted her to eat, the Yavam permits her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Shmuel taught that the Yavam permits her to eat only with the kind of Bi'ah with which the husband (when he did Chupah) permits her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen was Mekadesh a Bas Yisrael and he became deaf before Nisu'in, she does not eat. If he died and she fell to Yibum to a deaf brother, she eats. In this case the Yavam is stronger than the first husband.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav can answer like we answered for Shmuel in Version #1.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is difficult for Shmuel in this version.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DOES THE WIFE OF A DEAF KOHEN EAT TERUMAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen was Mekadesh a Bas Yisrael and he became deaf before Nisu'in, she does not eat. If she bears a son, she eats;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Noson says, if the son dies, she eats;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chachamim say, she does not eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Noson's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> Since she already ate, she continues to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> According to this, if a Bas Yisrael was married to a Kohen and he died, she should continue to eat, since she once ate?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, since he died, his Kedushah leaves her. Here also, when the son dies, his Kedushah leaves her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> R. Noson holds that Nisu'in when he was deaf permits her to eat Terumah (if he was healthy at the time of Kidushin). We do not decree lest she eat even if he was deaf at the time of Kidushin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, why did the Beraisa mention the birth of a son?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows that Chachamim argue even in that case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Noson should disagree with Chachamim in the Reisha!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He waited until they finished saying their law, then argued with them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, R. Noson's words should follow Chachamim's!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if one had Bi'ah with any Ervah...</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> Similarly, one who has Bi'ah with any Ervah (...disqualifies her. We do not distinguish between different kinds of Bi'ah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say 'Similarly'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We do not distinguish whether he was Shogeg or Mezid, willing or forced. In all cases, she is disqualified!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (and Answer #2):</span> No, 'similarly' refers to Ha'ara'ah (it is considered like full Bi'ah).</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot refer to Arayos, for this would this connote that Ha'ara'ah of Arayos is learned from a Yevamah. However, the Torah taught about Ha'ara'ah of Arayos, and Yevamah is learned from Arayos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (and Answer #3):</span> Rather, similarly one is liable for Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah with Arayos.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rabah):</span> If a Kohen's wife was raped, her husband is lashed for Bi'ah with her (after this), since she is a Zonah.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (We adopt Rashi's preferred explanation, DH Almanah.) A widow Mekudeshes to a Kohen Gadol or a divorcee or Chalutzah Mekudeshes to a regular Kohen may not eat Terumah (even if she is a Bas Kohen, for she is awaiting forbidden Bi'ah);</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If they were widowed or divorced from Nisu'in, they are disqualified. If they were widowed or divorced from Kidushin, they are Kesheros.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No. Permitted Kidushin (to a Yisrael) never permits eating Terumah (even after Nisu'in). You cannot learn to Kidushei Isur (to a Kohen), which permits eating Terumah (when she is permitted to him)!</p></div>
