<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHO MAY NOT EAT TERUMAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we expound "it", how will we expound "Any Ben Nechar (apostate) will not eat <i>it</i>"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Apostasy forbids eating from Pesach, but not from Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we expound "Any Arel will not eat it"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An Arel may not eat Pesach, but he eats Matzah and bitter herbs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Torah needed to write the Isur of Arel and also of an apostate:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it written only Arel, one might have thought that he is forbidden because he is repulsive, but an apostate may eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it written only Ben Nechar, one might have thought that he is forbidden because he does not want to serve Hash-m, but an Arel who wants to serve Hash-m (e.g. it is dangerous for him to circumcise) may eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is "Mimenu" repeated (regarding Pesach)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah uses it (for a Gezeirah Shavah, on Daf 74a).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Akiva):</span> We need not learn from there. It says "Ish Ish" (regarding the Isur for a Tamei to eat Terumah) to include an Arel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it comes to include an Onen!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> "V'Chol Zar (may not eat Terumah)", but an Onen may.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this permits an Arel, and not an Onen!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ish Ish" forbids an Arel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not learn the other way ("V'Chol Zar" permits an Arel, and "Ish Ish" forbids an Onen)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to forbid an Arel, since he has the following stringencies:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He needs to do an action;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This action must be done to his own body;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The punishment for remaining uncircumcised is Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The Isur applied before Matan Torah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Failure to circumcise his sons and slaves forbids him (to eat Pesach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that an Onen is forbidden, since:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It can apply at any time;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It applies to men and women;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>An Onen cannot fix himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There are more stringencies of an Arel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Even if there would not be more, we would learn this way!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Ish Ish" teaches about something that applies to a man, but not a woman, namely, Arelus!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HOW R. AKIVA AND R. ELIEZER EXPOUND</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Akiva learn from "Toshav v'Sachir"? (It cannot discuss Avadim Ivriyim, for they must eat Pesach!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Shemaya):</span> It includes a circumcised Aravi or Givoni (they may not eat Pesach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They are not considered circumcised (Arel already forbids them)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'Konam (should be forbidden like Hekdesh) any benefit I get from Arelim', he may benefit from an Arel Yisrael, but not from a circumcised Nochri;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he said 'Konam any benefit I get from circumcised people', he may benefit from a circumcised Nochri, but not from an Arel Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it includes a convert who was circumcised but did not immerse, and one who was born circumcised.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva requires Hatafas Dam Bris (taking blood from the place of Milah in order to fulfill the covenant).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Eliezer has no source to learn these laws. He holds that a convert who circumcised but did not immerse is a full convert, and he exempts someone born circumcised from Hatafas Dam Bris.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Eliezer learn from "Ish Ish"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah speaks like people do (we need not expound the repetition).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ORLAH BEFORE ITS TIME</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chama bar Ukva):</span> May we anoint an Arel baby with Terumah oil?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Does Orlah (foreskin) forbid one to eat Terumah even before the proper time for circumcision (the eighth day), or not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira - Beraisa):</span> The Torah taught only that failure to circumcise one's sons forbids him to <i>offer</i> Korban Pesach, and failure to circumcise his male slaves forbids him to eat it. A Gezeirah Shavah "Az-Az" teaches that failure to circumcise sons also forbids eating, and failure to circumcise slaves also forbids Hakravah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand how one can have (Arel) slaves at the time of eating, but did not have them at the time of Hakravah (so we need to learn the Isur to eat), i.e. he bought slaves in between;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>However, how can one have (Arel) sons at the time of eating (Pesach night), but did not have them at the time of Hakravah (Erev Pesach)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A son was born in between. This shows that Orlah forbids even before its time!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> This cannot be! "He will circumcise every male, then he will bring" - before its time, he may not circumcise!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, his son had a fever at the time of Hakravah (and could not be circumcised), and recovered before the time of eating.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we must wait seven days before circumcising, like Shmuel taught!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We did. The case is, he recovered seven days before Erev Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the father should have circumcised him in the morning (so he was forbidden to offer Pesach)!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">71b----------------------------------------71b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We require seven 24-hour days from the time of recovery (the baby recovered late in the afternoon, and the father offered Pesach early in the afternoon seven days later).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ludah's Beraisa):</span> The day of recovery is like the day of birth.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like we need not wait seven 24-hour days from the time of birth, we need not wait seven 24-hour days from the time of recovery!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the day of recovery is more severe than the day of birth. One must wait seven 24-hour days after recovery, but this is not needed after birth. (The Beraisa teaches that they are the same regarding the need to wait seven days.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question (1) - Rav Papa):</span> The baby's eyes hurt him at the time of Hakravah, and healed before the time of eating. (One must wait seven days only after a fever.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> His parents were imprisoned at the time of Hakravah (they did not circumcise due to Ones, so they were able to make a Shali'ach to offer Korban Pesach) and were released before the time of eating.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Kahana brei d'Rav Nechemyah):</span> The baby was a Tumtum. The genitals were covered at the time of Hakravah. The covering was torn and the baby was found to be a boy before the time of eating. (Maharsha - normally, a woman is not commanded to circumcise her son. Even so, failure to do so forbids her to offer and eat Pesach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Sharbiya):</span> The baby's head left the womb on Nisan 7, but he was not born until Erev Pesach, between the times of Hakravah and eating.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Such a baby cannot survive!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Once the baby enters the air of the world, what was closed (his mouth) is opened, and what was open (his navel, which was open to the umbilical cord) is closed. If not, the baby would die right away!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, a fever sustained him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">15.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whose fever sustained him?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it was the baby's fever, we must wait seven days from the end of the fever!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">16.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The mother's fever fed him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">17.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (13)):</span> We discuss a baby who cried (Tosfos' text - it was attached by its umbilical cord). The Beraisa discusses when this is not so, then it cannot live long.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TAHARAH OF AN AREL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Haza'ah (sprinkling water with ashes of the red heifer) may be done on an Arel, as was done to our forefathers - "The nation came up from the Jordan River on the 10th of the first month."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They were not circumcised on the 10th because they were weak from travelling.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When was Haza'ah done?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was done when they were still Arelim (on the 10th, so Taharah could be completed on the 14th, in time to offer Korban Pesach)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they did not bring the Pesach that year (and Haza'ah was after Milah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "They did the Pesach"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Mar Zutra):</span> Perhaps Pesach was brought b'Tum'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi - Beraisa):</span> They circumcised, immersed and did the Pesach in Taharah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>PRI'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Yitzchak):</span> Avraham was not commanded to do Pri'ah (to peel back the layer under the foreskin to reveal the crown) - "At that time Hash-m said to Yehoshua, make sharp knives (to circumcise Yisrael again)".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this was for those who were never circumcised - "... Those born in the Midbar had not circumcised"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Again". We must say that this time, Pri'ah was done.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the verse say "A second time"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This equates the end of circumcision with the beginning:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like the start of circumcision is Me'akev (one is an Arel if it was not done), also the end (Pri'ah) is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following strands invalidate a circumcision: skin that covers most of the crown. The man may not eat Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> This refers to skin that covers most of the height of the crown.</p></div>
