<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ONE WITNESS IS BELIEVED (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> If two witnesses say 'You ate Chelev', and he says 'I did not eat', he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir says, he must bring a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> If two witnesses can sentence him to death, which is stringent, all the more so they can obligate him to bring a Korban, which is lenient!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> (He is believed, for) if he wanted (to lie), he could say that he intentionally ate (to exempt himself)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim obligate a Korban in the Reisha (when there is one witness)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The witness is believed.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Normally two witnesses are believed against one who contradicts them, yet Chachamim exempt in this case!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that his silence is like an admission.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 4:e, 87b):</span> Reasoning teaches that one witness is believed. If we were in doubt about a piece of meat, whether it is Chelev or Shumen (permitted fat), and one witness comes and says that it is permitted, he is believed. The same applies here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Our case is different! The meat was never Muchzak (established) to be forbidden. Here, she was Muchzekes to be married, and two witnesses are needed (to change the Chazakah) regarding a matter pertaining to Arayos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Our case resembles a piece of meat known to be Chelev, and one witness says that he is sure that it is Shumen. He is not believed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rebuttal:</span> That is unlike our case! There, even if 100 witnesses say that it is Shumen, they are not believed. Here, if two witnesses say that he died, they are believed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> One witness is believed, just like he is believed (to permit an established Isur) regarding Tevel, Hekdesh, and Konamos (vows to forbid objects).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (part 1) Question:</span> What is the case of Tevel?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Tevel belongs to the witness, he is believed because it is b'Yado (even if it was Tevel he could permit it by separating Terumah and Ma'aseros. Here, if her husband is alive the witness cannot permit her!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Tevel belongs to someone else.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion - Objection:</span> If the Tana holds that Reuven can take Terumah to exempt Shimon's produce without Shimon's knowledge, the witness is believed because it is b'Yado;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he holds that one cannot exempt Shimon's produce without his consent, what is his source that the witness is believed?! (Our question about the source that one witness is believed applies to this case, too!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (part 2) Question:</span> What is the case of Hekdesh?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If its Kedushah is monetary, he is believed because it is b'Yado to redeem it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is Kedushas ha'Guf (e.g. a Korban) that he made Hekdesh, he is believed because it is b'Yado to regret and annul his Hekdesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, someone else was Makdish Kedushas ha'Guf. The witness says that the owner annulled his Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion - Objection:</span> What is the Tana's source that the witness is believed?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (part 3) Question:</span> How does he learn from Konamos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he holds that Me'ilah applies to Konamos and they have monetary Kedushah, the witness is believed because it is b'Yado to redeem it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that Me'ilah does not apply to Konamos. A mere Isur rests on them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion - Objection:</span> If the witness made the vow he is believed because it is b'Yado to annul the vow;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If someone else vowed and the witness says that the person annulled his vow, what is the Tana's source that the witness is believed?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Zeira):</span> Because we are so stringent with her in the end (our Mishnah puts 13 fines on her if her husband returns after she married), we are lenient on her in the beginning (surely she will not marry until she is sure that he died. Our Gemara found no source to believe one witness in other cases, e.g. to obligate a Korban or to say that a person annulled his Hekdesh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We should be not be stringent at the end, nor lenient at the beginning!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We were lenient to enable her to remarry.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IF TWO WITNESSES SAID THAT HER HUSBAND DIED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She may not remain with either husband ...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This applies only if she married based on the testimony of one witness. If two witnesses testified, she does not leave (the second husband).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> If the husband returned, how can she remain married to another man?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, we do not recognize that the man who returned is her husband.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, when she married based on one witness why can't she stay married?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, two witnesses say 'he is her original husband. We were with him from when he left until now. You do not recognize him!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> "Yosef recognized his brothers, and they did not recognize him" - this teaches that he left before his beard was complete, and now it was complete.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Two witnesses say that he died and two witnesses contradict them. One who has Bi'ah with her must bring an Asham Taluy (she is a Safek Eshes Ish. Why may she stay married?)!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">88b----------------------------------------88b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> She married one of the witnesses who say that he died. (He is sure that she is permitted, so he may remain with her.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> She must bring an Asham Taluy (for she is unsure. Why may she remain married?)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She says that she is sure that he died.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, obviously she may stay married! (Why did Rav have to teach this?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even R. Menachem b'Rebbi Yosi requires him to divorce her only when she married after witnesses said that her husband was alive. If she married before the witnesses came, she may stay married!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If two witnesses say that the husband died and two say that he did not die, or two say that she was divorced and two say that she was not divorced, she may not remarry. If she married, she may stay married;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Menachem b'Rebbi Yosi says, if the witnesses came before she remarried, she must leave. If they came after she remarried, she may stay married.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav discusses when witnesses came before she married. He teaches that the Halachah does not follow R. Menachem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav teaches that she may stay married only because she married before the witnesses came. Had she married after they came, she would have to leave. This is like R. Menachem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> "V'Kidashto (make a Kohen virtuous)" - against his will. This teaches that if he did not want to leave a woman forbidden to him, Dafno (force him).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case? (Surely, the verse teaches about a case that is not clear, i.e. when two pairs of witnesses argue about whether or not her husband died.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If she did not marry a witness who says that he died, or if she is unsure, surely we force (even a Yisrael)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, she married one of her witnesses and she is sure that her husband died, and the Beraisa teaches that we make him divorce her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Isurim of Kehunah (if her husband is alive she is a Zonah) are more stringent (than Eshes Ish).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> 'Dafno' means that we strive to find witnesses (that the husband is alive) before he marries her, so he will not marry her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The case is, the witnesses came before she married. This is like R. Menachem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (g) - Rav Ashi):</span> Rav said that she does not leave, i.e. the first man to whom she was permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav already taught that!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If she was married without permission (of Beis Din), she may return to her first husband.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This is the Halachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav taught only one of these two teachings. The other was inferred from the one that he taught, and was said in his name.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN SHE CONTRADICTS THE WITNESS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> She must leave only if she does not contradict the witness. If she contradicts him, she may stay married.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If two witnesses say that he is alive, her dissent means nothing!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> One witness says that he is alive.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had she not contradicted him, she would have had to leave!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ula taught that wherever the Torah believes one witness (e.g. the witness who says that he died), he is like two, and one witness (who says that he did not die) cannot discredit the testimony of two!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Shmuel discusses Pasul witnesses (who say he did not die), like R. Nechemyah taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nechemyah):</span> Wherever the Torah believes one witness, we follow the majority opinion. Two women against a man are like two men against a man.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Really, the law is, if one Kosher witness originally said that he died, even 100 women who contradict him are like just one man (the first man's testimony stands). The case is, she married based on the testimony of a woman;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We explain R. Nechemyah to say that wherever the Torah believes one witness, we follow the majority opinion. Two women against one woman are like two men against a man, but two women against a man is an even doubt.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHEN IS A GET NEEDED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She needs a Get from both men.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, she needs a Get from her first husband (she was truly married to him).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Why does she need a Get from the second man? It was mere Bi'as Zenus!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> This is a decree, lest people say that the first husband divorced her and she married the second man, and now she leaves him without a Get.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa (92a)):</span> If they told her that her husband David died and she became Mekudeshes to Levi and later David returned, she may return to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We should also decree there, lest people say that the David divorced her, Levi was Mekadesh her, and she leaves Levi without a Get!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> She needs a Get from Levi (to return to David).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, (it appears as if) David is Machazir Gerushaso after she became Mekudeshes to someone else!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Yosi ben Kipar, who forbids Machazir Gerushaso after she married someone else, but permits if she only became Mekudeshes to someone else.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> Even if Levi gives her a Get, it does not disqualify her from Kehunah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This implies that a Get is not required. If a Get was required, it would disqualify her!</p></div>
