<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS A <i>MO'AVIS</i> PERMITTED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Doeg asked like above. They were silent. Doeg was about to announce that David was forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Here it says "Amasha, the son of`... Yisra ha'Yisraeli who had Bi'ah with Avigayil Bas Nachash". Elsewhere he is called "Yisra ha'Yishmaeli"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> This teaches that he girded his sword like a Yishmaeli and said 'whoever does not accept my tradition will be pierced with a sword. I learned from Shmuel ha'Navi that an Amoni and a Mo'avi are forbidden, but not an Amonis or Mo'avis.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One is not believed to teach a law in such a case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> If a Chacham teaches a law relevant to a case at hand (Tosfos - that affects himself), we heed him only if he already taught the law before.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yisra was believed, since Shmuel and his Beis Din were around (the law was easily verifiable).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do'eg's question remains (the women should have gone out to greet the women)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Chachamim of Bavel):</span> "The honor of a Bas Melech is (to stay) inside" (women should not go out even to greet women).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael:</span> We learn this from " ... Where is your wife Sarah?" (It is praiseworthy that she stayed in the tent.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The following Tana'im also argue about this (the source that a Mo'avis is permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> An Amoni is forbidden, but not an Amonis; a Mo'avi, but not a Mo'avis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, "Because they did not go out ..." - it is the way of a man ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "You opened my binds" - David said to Hash-m, two binds that were on me, you opened - Rus the Mo'avis, and No'oma the Amonis (the mother of Rechavam, who succeeded Shlomo).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "... Your wonders and thoughts are upon <i>us</i>" - not upon me.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that Rechavam sat in David's lap, and David told him 'these two verses were said for me and you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Then I said, I have come; it is written in a Sefer about me" - David said, when I was anointed, I thought that my grandeur was just starting; I did not realize, it was already written in the Torah about me.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "that were found" regarding Lot's daughters (who gave birth to Amon and Mo'av), like it says, "I found David my servant".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DAUGHTER OF A CONVERTED <i>AMONI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula, citing R. Yochanan):</span> The daughter of a converted Amoni may marry a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava bar Ula):</span> Like whom is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is unlike R. Yehudah, for he says that a convert's daughter is like a Chalal's daughter!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is like R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! R. Yosi permits even the daughter of two converts to a Kohen!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that applies to converts that may marry Yisraelim, but not to forbidden converts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to make such a distinction?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the daughter of a Kohen Gadol from a widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from there, for the Bi'ah is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (This does not cause the Isur!) A Chalal's daughter is forbidden even though the Bi'ah was permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from a Chalal, since he himself was conceived through sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Kohen Gadol was not conceived through sin! We may learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah (what is common to both). Each case (a Kohen Gadol married to a widow, and Chalal) has something not found in the other. The common side is that they are unlike the majority of the congregation, and their daughters are forbidden to Kohanim. We learn that the same applies to an Amoni's daughter!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn. A Kohen Gadol to a widow and a Chalal both involve sin (but no sin led to an Amoni's daughter)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava bar Ula):</span> Perhaps you teach about an Amoni who married a Bas Yisrael. Even though Bi'ah is forbidden, the daughter may marry a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> Correct! The following shows that R. Yochanan discussed such a case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin, citing R. Yochanan):</span> The daughter of a converted Amoni or Mitzri Sheni is permitted (to a Kohen);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> She is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Reish Lakish learns from a Kohen Gadol and a widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The following shows why R. Yochanan permits.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">77b----------------------------------------77b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Zakai - Beraisa):</span> "He will marry a virgin from his nations" - this includes a Mechunah convert (her parents come from the same nation).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1A - R. Yochanan:</span> I expound "<i>me</i>'Amav (<i>from</i> his nations)" to permit a virgin that comes from two nations, and you learn only Mechunah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the two nations?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> An Amoni married an Amonis. These are considered two nations because the men are permitted and the women are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is like R. Zakai (but R. Yochanan disagreed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, an Amoni (or Mitzri Sheni) married a Bas Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #1B - R. Yochanan:</span> I expound "<i>me</i>'Amav" to permit a virgin that comes from two nations, and one of those nations has in it two nations, and you learn only Mechunah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to this version, how does R. Yochanan learn that a Mitzri Sheni's daughter is permitted? ("Me'Amav" does not discuss Mitzriyim, for it is not like two nations; men and women are forbidden equally.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He learns from an Amoni who married a Bas Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from Amonim, for (even if she were considered an Amonis,) the females are permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The child of a Mitzri Sheni from a Mitzris Shenis is permitted, even though females (Mitzriyos) are forbidden. This shows that this factor is irrelevant!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> There, Bi'ah is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The child of an Amoni from a Bas Yisrael is permitted even though Bi'ah is forbidden! We learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah of these two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I had heard Rav Yehudah say 'Amav' - "<i>me</i>Amav" and I did not understand. (Now, I understand.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah - (R. Zakai - Beraisa):</span> An Amonis is permitted. Her son from an Amoni is forbidden. Her daughter from an Amoni is permitted (the entire Beraisa will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This applies after they converted; but her daughter from an Amoni is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Do not teach this in the Beis Medrash!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I agree that an Amonis is permitted - "Amoni", not an Amonis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>I agree that her son from an Amoni is forbidden, since he is an Amoni;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> You said 'Her daughter from an Amoni is permitted' - to whom?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is not to Yisrael. If her mother is permitted, all the more so the daughter (she was born in Kedushah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She is permitted to a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> You said 'This applies after they converted; but her daughter from an Amoni is forbidden' - to what does this refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If an Amoni married an Amonis, that is a convert Mechunah (she is Kesherah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, an Amoni married a Bas Yisrael (and you forbid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Do not teach this in the Beis Medrash (it is wrong)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS A <i>MITZRIS</i> FORBIDDEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Mitzri or Edomi is forbidden ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim challenge R. Shimon's Kal va'Chomer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Arayos disprove the Kal va'Chomer. They are forbidden only until three generations (the Torah permits a man to his great granddaughter), yet Arayos through males and females (e.g. the daughters of one's son <i>and</i> daughter) are forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot challenge from Arayos, for they are Chayavei Kerisos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Mamzerim. Even a Mamzeres is forbidden, even though this is not Chayavei Kerisos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> You cannot learn from Mamzerim, for all generations are forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah. In Arayos and Mamzerim, both males and females are forbidden. The same applies to Mitzriyim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Tzad ha'Shavah is invalid, since both sources involve Chayavei Kerisos (a Mamzer results from Kares)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (c)):</span> Rather, Chachamim ask from a Chalal who results from Chayavei Aseh, like R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was R. Shimon's answer 'No, rather...'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> I do not hold like R. Eliezer ben Yakov (so I hold that the Kal va'Chomer is valid). You, who (reject the Kal va'Chomer because you) hold like him should know that I have a tradition to permit the females.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> I received my law on tradition. Also, the verse supports me - "Sons" are forbidden, but not daughters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> "Sons" are forbidden, but not daughters;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Yehudah says, "Banim who will be born to them ..." - the verse ascribes (the Isur) to birth (to the mother. If she were permitted, also her children would be!)</p>
