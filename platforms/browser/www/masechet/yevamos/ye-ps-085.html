<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If we learned from there, one would think that this applies only to Mitzvos that are Shavah b'Chol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Tum'ah is not Shavah b'Chol, yet we need a verse to teach that women (Kohanos) are not forbidden to become Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Bnei Aharon" are forbidden not to become Tamei, but women (Benos Aharon) are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This Isur applies only to Kohanim, and if not for the verse, it would apply to women!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It would apply to women due to Rav Yehudah's teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, we would have learned this from "Lo Yikachu ".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 4:j, 84b):</span> (Indeed, "A man or a woman" teaches that even a Lav she'Einah Shavah b'Chol applies to women.) "Lo Yikachu" is needed so we will not learn from Tum'ah that women are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are Kesheros forbidden to marry Chalalim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa - Mishnah):</span> Ten lineages came up from Bavel: Kohanim, Leviyim, Yisraelim, Chalalim, converts, freed slaves, Mamzerim, Nesinim, Shtuki (one whose mother is known, but not his father) and Asufi (a baby found abandoned; his parents are unknown);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kohanim, Leviyim and Yisraelim may intermarry. Leviyim, Yisraelim, Chalalim, converts and freed slaves may intermarry. Converts, freed slaves, Mamzerim, Nesinim, Shtuki and Asufi may intermarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah does not permit Kohanos and Chalalim to intermarry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> The Mishnah teaches cases in which the men may marry the women and the women may marry the men. Since a Kohen may not marry a Chalalah, it did not teach that Kohanim and Chalalim may intermarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Idi bar Avin citing Rav Yehudah):</span> Kesheros may marry Chalalim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO RECEIVES A <i>KESUVAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Sheniyos mid'Rabanan (do not receive a Kesuvah...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Bnei Biri):</span> If a woman is a Sheniyah to her husband but not to her Yavam, does she receive a Kesuvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since we learned that a Yevamah collects her Kesuvah from the property of the deceased, she does not have one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since we enacted a Kesuvah from the Yavam when there is no property from the deceased, here also!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> A Yevamah collects her Kesuvah from the property of the deceased.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she was a Sheniyah to the deceased, she does not have a Kesuvah from the Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Indeed, this answers the question. However, the Beraisa is difficult! The Reisha connotes that no one has a Kesuvah from the Yavam.) The Seifa connotes that other women (not Sheniyos) have a Kesuvah from the Yavam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that she has a Kesuvah from the deceased's property. If he left no property, they enacted a Kesuvah from the Yavam. If she was a Sheniyah to the deceased, she has no Kesuvah even from the Yavam.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> If a widow married a Kohen Gadol, or a divorcee or Chalutzah married a regular Kohen, does she receive food?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If she is still married, she must leave him. Should she be fed?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he went overseas and she borrowed money for food.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Food is a provision of a Kesuvah. Since she has a Kesuvah, she has provisions;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, perhaps she has a Kesuvah, since she gets it when she leaves (and we want her to leave), but she does not get food, for it helps her remain married!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> She is not fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> She is fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa refers to after his death.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Elazar):</span> She is standing to be divorced!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Elazar):</span> The Beraisa refers to after his death.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHICH WOMEN HAVE NO <i>KESUVAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a widow married a Kohen Gadol, or a divorcee or Chalutzah married a regular Kohen, she has a Kesuvah, fruits (of her property), food, and Bala'os (remnants of or compensation for depreciation of her property);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She is disqualified and her child is disqualified. We force him to divorce her;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A Sheniyah mid'Rabanan does not have a Kesuvah, fruit, food, or Bala'os;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She is Kesherah and her child is Kosher. We force him to divorce her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Why did they say that a widow married to a Kohen Gadol has a Kesuvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> It is because he is disqualified (Tosfos - their child is a Chalal; Rashi - while married to her, he is like a Chalal) and she is disqualified. Whenever both are disqualified, they fined him to pay a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">85b----------------------------------------85b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Why did they say that a Sheniyah mid'Rabanan does not have a Kesuvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> It is because he and she are Kesherim. In such cases, she is fined and has no Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to both questions - Rebbi):</span> Torah Isurim do not need strengthening (so she receives her Kesuvah). Rabbinic Isurim need strengthening (so she is fined).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Another answer - a Kohen Gadol entices a widow to marry him, but a Sheniyah entices the man to marry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who taught this other answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Shimon ben Elazar taught it. He explains that when they are disqualified he must pay a Kesuvah, for (presumably) he enticed her. When they are Kesherim she has no Kesuvah, for (presumably) she enticed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rebbi taught it. He was bothered why a Chalutzah has a Kesuvah, since it is a Rabbinic Isur!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He answered that since he disqualifies her mid'Rabanan, he entices her. A woman loses her Kesuvah only in cases where she enticed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what case do R. Shimon ben Elazar and Rebbi argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> They argue about a Mamzeres or Nesinah married to a Yisrael:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she has a Kesuvah when the Isur is mid'Oraisa, she has a Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it depends on who entices whom, she has no Kesuvah, for she entices him (since her grandchild can be permitted, e.g. if her son marries a Shifchah and frees the child).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> According to R. Eliezer, who says that a Mamzer's child from a Shifchah is a Mamzer slave (and her grandchild cannot become permitted), she would not entice him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> They argue about Machazir (one who remarries) Gerushaso after she married someone else:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she has a Kesuvah when the Isur is mid'Oraisa, she has a Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it depends on who entices whom, she has no Kesuvah, for she entices him (since her child is Kosher).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> According to R. Akiva, who says that the child of Chayavei Lavin is a Mamzer, she will not entice him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> They argue about a non-virgin married to a Kohen Gadol:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is a Torah Isur, but she entices (since her child is Kosher).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> According to R. Eliezer ben Yakov, who says that a Chalal results from Chayavei Aseh, she will not entice him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> They argue about one who remarries his Safek Sotah (she was secluded and is forbidden to him).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is a Torah Isur, but she entices (since she remains Kesherah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> According to R. Masya ben Charash, who says that even if he has Bi'ah with her on the way to drink Mei Sotah he makes her a Zonah, she will not entice him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> They argue about one who remarries his Vadai Sotah (she is already a Zonah due to adultery).</p>
