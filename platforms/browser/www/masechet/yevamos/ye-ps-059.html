<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>AN ARUSAH WHO BECAME FORBIDDEN TO A KOHEN GADOL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she was widowed or divorced...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Yosef):</span> If a Kohen Gadol was Mekadesh a minor and she became a Bogeres, may he make Nisu'in?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Does it depend on (the time of) Nisu'in (he may not marry a Bogeres)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, does it depend on Kidushin (then, she was permitted)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel - Mishnah):</span> If she was widowed or divorced from Nisu'in, she is Pesulah. If she was widowed or divorced from Eirusin, she is Kesherah (the Pesul depends on Nisu'in).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Clarification of question (R. Chiya):</span> I did not ask if he makes her a Chalalah (disqualified from Kehunah). Only Bi'ah does that!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Hu Ishah bi'Vsuleha <i>Yikach</i>" - does this refer to Kidushin or Nisu'in?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel - Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen was Mekadesh a widow and was appointed Kohen Gadol, he may marry her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That case is different. "Yikach Ishah" permits it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The same verse permits if she became a Bogeres during Eirusin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The verse permits only one case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should it permit when he was appointed Kohen Gadol, and not when she became a Bogeres?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the latter case, her body changed. In the former case, it did not.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHOM A KOHEN GADOL MAY MARRY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Kohen Gadol may not marry a widow, whether from Eirusin or Nisu'in;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He may not marry a Bogeres;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Elazar and R. Shimon permit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>He may not marry a Mukas Etz (one who lost her Besulim (tokens of virginity) through an accident, not through Bi'ah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Almanah... Lo Yikach" - whether from Kidushin or Nisu'in.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we learn from Tamar. She was widowed from Nisu'in and she was called Almanah. Perhaps also the Almanah forbidden to a Kohen Gadol is only from Nisu'in!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn that way?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, a widow resembles a divorcee (which is written adjacent to it). A divorcee is forbidden even from Eirusin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may not marry a Bogeres.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "He will take a woman bi'Vsuleha" - this excludes a Bogeres, whose Besulim are depleted;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>R. Elazar and R. Shimon permit a Bogeres.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir says, 'Besulah' connotes having some Besulim. 'Besulehah' connotes having all of them. 'Bi'Vsulehah' connotes virginity in the place of normal Bi'ah, but not necessarily in the place of Lo k'Darkah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Elazar and R. Shimon say that 'Besulah' connotes all the Besulim. Besulehah connotes even some. Bi'Vsulehah mandates virginity even in the place of Lo k'Darkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah disqualifies a woman from a Kohen (Gadol).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> "She will be a wife <i>to him</i> (the man who raped her)" - a woman permitted to him. This excludes a widow to a Kohen Gadol, and a divorcee or Chalutzah to a regular Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If a Kohen Gadol raped her k'Darkah, even if she is not a widow she is forbidden to him since she is not a virgin!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that he raped her Lo k'Darkah. She is forbidden to him because she is a widow, but not because she is not a virgin!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">59b----------------------------------------59b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Meir. Rav rules like R. Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Elazar, she is even a Zonah (and forbidden to any Kohen)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If a bachelor [really any man] had Bi'ah with a single girl not l'Shem Kidushin, he makes her a Zonah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> The case is, she had Bi'ah with an animal. She is not a virgin, but she is not a Zonah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> This is unreasonable!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If she is not a virgin, she is also a Zonah! If she is a virgin, she is not a Zonah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> She is Asur to a Kohen Gadol because she is a Mukas Etz in the place of Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If Mukas Etz applies there, every girl is a Mukas Etz due to rocks (used to clean herself after defecating)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Zeira):</span> She did Mi'un.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DISQUALIFICATIONS TO A KOHEN GADOL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Simi bar Chiya):</span> A girl that had Bi'ah with an animal is Kesherah to Kehunah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If she had Bi'ah with one who is not a man, even though she is liable to be stoned, she is Kesherah to Kehunah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> A case occurred in Heisalo in which a dog had Bi'ah with a girl. Rebbi permitted her to a Kohen (Gadol).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Shmuel):</span> There was no Kohen Gadol in Rebbi's day! Rather, he said that she is fit for a Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava mi'Parzika):</span> What is the source that Zenus does not apply to animals?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> "The hire of a harlot, or what is traded for a dog, (both of them may not be offered for a Korban)";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may offer the hire of a dog (for bestiality), or what is traded for a Zonah. "Both of them" are forbidden, but not all four combinations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Kohen Gadol may not marry a woman whom he himself raped or enticed. If he married her, he is married;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>He may not marry a woman raped or enticed by another man.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, if he married her, the child is a Chalal;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Chachamim say that the child is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHOM A KOHEN GADOL MAY MARRY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he married her (a woman he himself raped or enticed), he is married.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> He must divorce her with a Get.</p></div>
