<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN A WIDOW EATS <i>TERUMAH</i> AND <i>MA'ASER </i>(cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If a Bas Kohen married a Yisrael she may not eat Terumah. If he died and she has a son from him, she does not eat Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she married a Levi, she eats Ma'aser. If he died and she has a son from him, she eats Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If she married a Kohen, she eats Terumah. If he died and she has a son from him, she eats Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If her son from the Kohen died, she may eat Ma'aser. If her son from the Levi died, she may not eat Ma'aser. If her son from the Yisrael died, we apply "She will return to her father's house like when she was a Na'arah; she will eat from her father's bread."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (In the Reisha) if her son from the Levi dies, she resumes eating Terumah due to her son (from the Kohen). What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> We learn from "<i>U</i>'Vas (Kohen)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like R. Akiva, who expounds 'Vav'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Even Chachamim agree here, since the entire verse "U'Vas..." is extra.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> She returns to eat Terumah, but not Chazah v'Shok.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> We learn from "She will not eat bi'SeRUMas ha'Kodoshim" - what is MuRaM (lifted) from the Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> She eats "<i>Mi</i>'Lechem Aviha", but not all his food. This excludes Chazah v'Shok.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> Perhaps the verse (discusses when she vowed not to eat some of his food, and it) teaches that her father does not resume authority to annul her vows!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We already know that from Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael) Question:</span> What do we learn from "The vow of a widow or divorcee will stand"? She is not in the jurisdiction of her father or husband (obviously, no one can annul her vow)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, her father or his Sheluchim handed her over to the Sheluchim of the husband, and she was widowed or divorced on the way;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Is it as if she was still in her father's house? Or, is it as if she entered her husband's house?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The verse teaches that once she leaves her father's jurisdiction for a moment, he cannot annul her vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #3 (Rav Safra):</span> She eats "Mi'<i>Lechem</i> Aviha" - bread, but not meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #4 (Rav Papa):</span> She eats "Mi'Lechem Aviha" - food that her father owns. This excludes Chazah v'Shok, which he (does not own but) merits to eat from Hash-m's table.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #5 (Rava):</span> "You will eat the chest and foreleg ... and your daughters with you" - when they are with you (but not after Nisu'in).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah - Beraisa):</span> A Bas Kohen who returns to her father's house eats Terumah, but not Chazah v'Shok. A Bas Yisrael who returns to eat Terumah due to her son eats even Chazah v'Shok (the above Drashos do not apply to her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> Since you learn (that she resumes eating due to her son) from "U'Vas                                                         Kohen (who returns to her father's house)", you cannot learn more than that case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mordechai):</span> In that case, the Torah excluded Chazah v'Shok. Here, it does not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A <i>YEVAMAH</i> OR A PREGNANT WIDOW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Bas Kohen married a Yisrael ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "She will return to her father's house (after he dies)" excludes a Shomeres Yavam. "ki'N'ureha (like in her youth)" excludes if she is pregnant;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A child from a previous husband does not count like a child from the latter husband to exempt a widow from Yibum, but a fetus is like a born child (to exempt);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A child from a previous husband counts like a child from the latter husband to disqualify a widow from eating Terumah, all the more so, a fetus should count like a born child (to disqualify)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from this Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A fetus is like a born child to exempt from Yibum, since children who die (after the husband) are like live children (to exempt);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot say that a fetus should count like a born child (to forbid eating Terumah), since children who die are not like live children for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Therefore, we need "ki'N'ureha" to exclude a pregnant widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Torah needed to write both ("ki'N'ureha" to exclude) a pregnant widow and "She has no seed":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it written only "She has no seed", we would think that she does not return to eat Terumah because she was one body and became two bodies, but a pregnant woman is still one body, so she would eat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only that a pregnant widow does not eat, we would think that this is because she was empty and now she is full, but one who had children is still an empty body, so she would eat.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah of Diskarta):</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that dead children are not like live children regarding Yibum!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A FALSE REPORT OF A MAN'S DEATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man went overseas; they (really, one witness) told his wife that he died. If she remarried and her husband returned, the following fines apply:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She may not remain with either man; she needs a Get from both men; she does not receive from either man a Kesuvah, nor Peiros (of her property), nor food, nor Bala'os (compensation for depreciation, or remnants) of her property. If she received, she must return them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she has a child from either man, he is a Mamzer. If she dies, neither husband becomes Tamei to engage in her burial. Neither receives her Metzi'os (Hefker objects that she finds) or earnings. Neither may annul her vows;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If she is a Bas Yisrael, she is disqualified from Kehunah. If she is a Bas Levi, she is disqualified from Ma'aser. If she is a Bas Kohen, she is disqualified from Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The heirs of either husband do not inherit her Kesuvah. If the husbands die, the brothers do Chalitzah but not Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yosi says, she receives a Kesuvah from her first husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Elazar says, the first husband receives her Metzi'os and earnings, and may annul her vows;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>R. Shimon says, if the first husband dies and his brother did Yibum or Chalitzah, he exempted the Tzarah. If she has a child from the first husband, he is not a Mamzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she remarried (according to two witnesses,) without (special) permission of Beis Din, she may return to her first husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If she was married through permission of Beis Din, she must leave (both husbands) and she is exempt from a Korban. If she was married without permission of Beis Din, she must leave and bring a Korban;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Seifa says that if she married without permission of Beis Din, she may return to her first husband. 'Without permission' means according to witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Reisha discusses with permission of Beis Din, i.e. through one witness. This shows that one witness is believed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (Mishnah):</span> It became established to marry based on a witness who heard from a witness, or a woman who heard from a woman or slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This also shows that one witness is believed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Mishnah):</span> If one witness said 'You ate Chelev' and the person denied it, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He is exempt only because he denied it. Had he been silent, the witness would have been believed. This shows that one witness is believed mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one witness is believed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> "Or if his sin became known to him (he brings a Korban)", but not if witnesses told him.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Or his sin became known to him" - he is liable no matter how he found out.</p>
