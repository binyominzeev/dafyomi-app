<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MAY AN AREL EAT MA'ASER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 1:a, 73a - Beraisa):</span> If strands were left that invalidate the Milah, he may not eat Terumah, Pesach, Kodshim or Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to Ma'aser (Sheni) of grain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No, it refers to Ma'aser Behemah (one of every 10 animals born each year becomes a Korban).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is Kodshim, which the Beraisa already listed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Pesach was also listed, even though it is Kodshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is necessary to teach both Pesach and Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Had it taught only Pesach, one might have thought that this is because the Torah explicitly forbids an Arel to eat Pesach, but this does not apply to Kodshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Had it taught only Kodshim, one might have thought that this refers only to Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We cannot explain why it would teach Ma'aser Behemah in addition to Kodshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> The Beraisa refers to Ma'aser Rishon. It is like R. Meir, who says that only Leviyim may eat Ma'aser Rishon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Chiya bar Rav mi'Difti's Beraisa):</span> Two kinds of Ma'aser are forbidden to an Arel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to Ma'aser Sheni and Ma'aser Behemah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it refers to (Ma'aser Beheimah and) Ma'aser Rishon, according to R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa #1):</span> An Onen is forbidden to eat Ma'aser, and permitted to Terumah and Parah Adumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Tevul Yom is forbidden to Terumah and permitted to Ma'aser and Parah Adumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Mechusar Kipurim (one who must bring a Korban to complete his Taharah) is forbidden to Parah Adumah and permitted to Terumah and Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> If an Arel were permitted to Ma'aser, the Beraisa should teach that an Arel is forbidden to Terumah and permitted to Parah Adumah and Ma'aser!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This Tana is R. Akiva, who considers an Arel like a Tamei (Rashi - so he is forbidden even to Parah Adumah. Rambam, according to Maharsha - R. Akiva forbids an Arel to Ma'aser. We ask about Chachamim's opinion):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "Ish Ish" (regarding the Isur for a Tamei to eat Terumah) includes an Arel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of Beraisa #1 (who forbids Mechusar Kipurim to Parah Adumah? We follow the Gra's text.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Yosef ha'Bavli:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If an Onen or Mechusar Kipurim burned Parah Adumah, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yosef ha'Bavli says, if an Onen burned it, it is Kosher. If a Mechusar Kipurim burned it, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>(Rambam - not only R. Akiva, but) also R. Yitzchak forbids an Arel to Ma'aser from a Gezeirah Shavah "Mimenu-Mimenu";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "Mimenu" regarding Pesach and regarding Ma'aser. Just like an Arel is forbidden to Pesach, also to Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WE LEARN FROM PESACH TO MA'ASER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The words must be free to learn the Gezeirah Shavah. If not, we cannot learn from Pesach, since it has the stringencies of Pigul, Nosar, and (Kares for a person who eats it when he is) Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Affirmation:</span> Yes, the words are free.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we show that the words are free?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It says "Mimenu" three times regarding Pesach. One is needed for the simple meaning (the Isur to eat it raw applies only to Pesach, not to Matzah and Maror), and two are extra. One of the two is used for the Gezeirah Shavah. (The other was merely included with the verse that discusses burning the Nosar);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to the opinion that this Aseh (to burn Nosar) exempts the Lav (not to leave it over) from lashes, since the Torah needed to say 'Nosar', it also says "Mimenu";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to the opinion that the verse mandates waiting another morning before burning it, since the Torah needed to say "until morning", it also says "Mimenu".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>It says "Mimenu" three times regarding Ma'aser. One is needed for the simple meaning, and two are extra. One of these two teaches R. Avahu's law (73b, that one may burn Tamei Terumah). The other teaches Reish Lakish's law:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "V'Lo Nasati Mimenu l'Mes", but a similar usage for a living person, i.e. anointing, is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This teaches that one may anoint with Tamei Ma'aser Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra):</span> Perhaps the verse forbids buying a coffin or shrouds with Ma'aser Sheni!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> "Mimenu" - from (Ma'aser) itself (not from its value).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> "V'Lo Nasati" is like (what follows it,) "I did not eat". Just like the latter refers to the Ma'aser itself, also the former.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Gezeirah Shavah is free from one side (what is written by Pesach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that in such a case, we learn and do not challenge;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to the opinion that we learn and challenge, how can we answer? (We can challenge like above (a)!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (The Gezeirah Shavah is free both sides.) We learn R. Avahu's law (not from "Mimenu", rather,) like Rav Nachman:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> "V'Nasati Lecha Es Mishmeres Terumosai (plural)" alludes to two Terumos, Tahor and Tamei. It is "Lecha" (for your needs); you may cook with it while burning it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TEMEI'IM MAY NOT EAT TERUMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Temei'im (may not eat Terumah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We learn from "Any man from the seed of Aharon (who is a Metzora or Zav will not eat Kodshim until he is Tahor.)"</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">74b----------------------------------------74b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This refers to Terumah, which all seed of Aharon (i.e. even females) may eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the verse refers to Chazeh v'Shok (from Shelamim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Some females, e.g. a Bas Kohen who returns to eat Terumah after being widowed or divorced from a Yisrael, may not eat them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Likewise, a Chalalah may not eat Terumah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Chalalah is not considered the seed of Aharon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that "Until he is Tahor" refers to nightfall? Perhaps it means after he brings his Korban (then he may eat Terumah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> The verse discusses a Zav who had two emissions and a Metzora Musgar, who do not bring Korbanos, similar to a Tamei Mes (at the end of the verse. Therefore, "Yithar" must refer to nightfall.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Perhaps a Tamei who must bring a Korban (e.g. a Zav who had three emissions and a Metzora Muchlat) is forbidden to Terumah until he offers it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> What is the source for the following Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> After immersing, he may eat Ma'aser. After dark, he may eat Terumah. After offering his Korban, he may eat Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (Rava):</span> There are three verses (which seem to contradict each other)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"He will not eat Kodshim until bathing" implies that after Tevilah he is Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It also says "At nightfall he will be Tahor, then he will eat Kodshim";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It also says "The Kohen will atone for her and she will be Tahor"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> The first verse refers to Ma'aser, the second to Terumah, and the third to Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the first refers to Terumah, and the second to Ma'aser!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Presumably, Terumah is more stringent:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Tamei who eats it is Chayav Misah (b'Yedei Shamayim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Zar who eats it b'Shogeg adds a Chomesh (when paying for what he ate);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It cannot be redeemed;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>One may not burn Tamei Ma'aser, and one who eats Tamei Ma'aser is lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Bi'ur applies to it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Misah is more stringent (this is the overriding consideration).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Even without this, it says "A soul (that will touch... will immerse and be Tahor)";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Ma'aser applies to every soul (but only Kohanim eat Terumah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHEN IS THE KORBAN ME'AKEV?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this only applies to a Tamei who is not Mechusar Kipurim, but a Mechusar Kipurim may not eat until he brings his Korban!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It says about a Yoledes (one who gave birth) "Until the days of her Taharah are completed". This implies that once the days are completed, she is Tehorah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradicition:</span> It also says "The Kohen will atone for her and she will be Tehorah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Resolution):</span> The first verse teaches when she can eat Terumah. The latter teaches when she may eat Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should say the other way!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, Kodshim is more stringent, because:</p></div>
