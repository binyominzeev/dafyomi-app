<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE KORBAN FOR A MISTAKEN RULING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> For any Mitzvah punishable by Kares or Chatas, if one transgressed b'Shogeg:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A (regular) individual brings a female goat or lamb;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Nasi brings a male goat;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A Mashi'ach or Beis Din brings a bull.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>For idolatry, an individual, Nasi or Mashi'ach brings a goat (a Chatas). The Tzibur (Beis Din) brings a bull for an Olah and a goat for a Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah from "V'Nod'ah ha'Chatas Asher Chat'u Aleha";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It also says "Aleha" regarding Achos Ishto, which is punishable by Kares and Chatas. Here also, we discuss something punishable by Kares and Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This answers only for the Tzibur. What is the source regarding a Mashi'ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "For the guilt of the nation" equates him to the Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn an individual and Nasi from a Gezeirah Shavah "Mitzvos-Mitzvos".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> For idolatry they bring only for something punishable by Kares and Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>A Gezeirah Shavah "Einei-Einei" teaches this law for the Tzibur;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>We learn an individual, Nasi and Mashi'ach from "And if one Nefesh". Each of these is a Nefesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"And" shows that we learn the latter Parashah from the previous one.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CHACHAMIM'S SOURCE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim learn this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn like R. Yehoshua taught to his son, "<i>Torah</i> Achas Yihyeh Lachem la'Oseh bi'Shgagah; veha'Nefesh Asher Ta'aseh b'Yad Ramah (Es Hash-m Hu Megadef-)";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Regarding Korban,) the entire Torah is equated to idolatry (Megadef), which is punishable by Kares and Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about an individual, Nasi and Mashi'ach, for regular sins and idolatry;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>How do we know the law of the Tzibur regarding idolatry?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>And</i> if a Nefesh" equates the Tzibur to an individual, which is written after it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know the law of the Tzibur regarding other Mitzvos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "me'Einei -me'Einei."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rebbi learn from "Torah Achas"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> The Torah distinguished between individuals and a multitude (a city that served idolatry b'Mezid). Individuals are stoned (a severe death), so their money is saved. An Ir ha'Nidachas is killed by the sword (a lighter death), so their money is destroyed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps their Korbanos are different (for Shogeg)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Torah Achas Yihyeh Lachem."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chilkiyah):</span> If not for this verse, a city would bring a different Korban. What would they bring?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They cannot bring a bull, for the Tzibur brings this for other Mitzvos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They cannot bring a female sheep, for an individual brings this for other Mitzvos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They cannot bring a goat, for a Nasi brings this for other Mitzvos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>They cannot bring a bull for an Olah and a goat for a Chatas, for the Tzibur brings this for idolatry!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>They cannot bring a female goat, for an individual brings this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Tzibur brings a bull for an Olah and a goat for a Chatas for a mistaken ruling. One might have thought that a city brings the reverse for idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> One might have thought that they must bring a different Korban, but they have no solution!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Torah Achas Yihyeh Lachem la'Oseh bi'Shgagah" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AN ADDITIONAL CASE IN THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Levi):</span> Why didn't the Mishnah teach a 16th case?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> It seems that he (Levi) has no brain in his skull.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do you think that it should teach Imo Anusas Aviv (a woman who falls to Yibum to her son born out of wedlock)? R. Yehudah and Chachamim disagree about this, and the Tana does not list cases subject to dispute.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva and Chachamim argue about Chayavei Lavin and Arayos mid'Rabanan, yet a Mishnah teaches them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In our Perek it does not teach such cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Perek teaches that Beis Shamai permit the Tzaros to the brothers, and Beis Hillel forbid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Shamai is not considered a dissenting opinion against Beis Hillel (since the Halachah always follows Beis Hillel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon and Chachamim argue about Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo (when the Yavam was born after his brother died), yet the Mishnah teaches them!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon agrees in a case when the Yavam was born before his older brother did Yibum (and afterwards the older brother died).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Oshaya said that R. Shimon argues even in this case!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Oshaya was refuted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (A Mishnah (26a) forbids two sisters who fell to Yibum from different brothers to do Yibum. Each is Achos Zekukaso, the sister of someone awaiting Yibum with the Yavam. If a sister is Ervah to the Yavam, her sister may do Yibum. If there are two surviving brothers and each sister is an Ervah to a different brother, each is permitted to the other brother. Rav and a Beraisa recited by R. Chiya teach that this can occur for each case (of Ervah in our Mishnah, e.g. daughter-in-law. I.e. one sister is Asur to Shimon (she is his daughter-in-law) and permitted to Yehudah, and the other sister is Asur to Yehudah (his daughter-in-law) and permitted to Shimon. The sister (of the Ervah) may do Yibum or Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Yehudah applies this teaching to the Arayos starting with a mother-in-law, but not in the first six cases. This is because the case of Bito (his daughter) arises only through rape, not through marriage.  (If the daughters of Shimon and Yehudah are sisters, they must have the same mother (Dinah). If Shimon married Dinah, Yehudah can marry her only if she falls to Yibum, but in our case Shimon and his daughter are alive.) We do not discuss such cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Abaye applied it even to Bito, even though it arises only through rape.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Abaye did not apply it to Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo. This is because it arises only according to R. Shimon, but not according to Chachamim, and we do not discuss disputes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rav Safra includes Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo. The case arises with six brothers, according to R. Shimon. (This is the question against Rebbi: we must discuss disputes to apply the Beraisa's rules in all cases!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A way to remember the case is 'death, birth, Yibum; death, birth, Yibum'. (Reuven died, Shimon was born, Yisachar did Yibum to Esther (Eshes Reuven), Levi died, Yehudah was born, Zevulun did Yibum to Devorah (Eshes Levi). If Yisachar and Zevulun now die, Esther is forbidden (Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo) to Shimon but permitted to Yehudah. Devorah is forbidden to Yehudah but permitted to Shimon.)</p></div>
