<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN IS <i>TUM'AH</i> <i>BATEL</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah holds like he taught elsewhere, that there is never Bitul Min b'Mino (when everything is the same species).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it wasn't dissolved, it is not Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Seifa discuss a Tahor piece of Chatas mixed with Chulin? It should distinguish between Tamei pieces:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'This applies only if it was dissolved. If not, it is not Batel'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana prefers to teach about a Tahor piece among Tahor pieces. (It is a bigger Chidush to say that it is not Batel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Reish Lakish, what is the difference between the Reisha and the Seifa? (If it is dissolved, in any case it should be Batel!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> The Reisha discusses Tum'ah due to liquids, which is only mid'Rabanan. The Seifa discusses Bitul (to permit a Zar to eat Kodshei Kodoshim, an Isur) mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it became Tamei (mid'Oraisa) through a Sheretz, it would not be Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Seifa teach about a Tahor piece of Chatas mixed with Chulin? It should distinguish within the case of Tamei pieces:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is Batel if the Tum'ah was from liquids. If the Tum'ah was due to a Sheretz, it is not Batel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Tana prefers to teach about a Tahor piece among Tahor pieces.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> The Reisha permits (through Bitul to eat a Tamei piece, which is) Chayavei Lavin. The Seifa discusses (Bitul that would permit a Tamei to eat Kodshim, which is) Chayavei Kerisos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rabah himself taught that within mid'Oraisa laws we do not distinguish between Chayavei Lavin and Chayavei Kerisos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Seifa discusses Davar she'Yesh Lo Matirim (it is permitted in another situation). Such a thing is never Batel, even if it is mixed with 1000 pieces.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Ashi's answer makes no sense!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For a Kohen, the piece is always permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For a Yisrael, it is always forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rav Ashi's answer is rejected.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>TERUMAH</i> NOWADAYS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan does not hold that Terumah is mid'Oraisa nowadays!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There were two baskets, one of Chulin and one of Terumah. In front of them were two Sa'im (measures), one of Terumah and one of Chulin. The Sa'im fell into the baskets. The Chulin basket is still permitted, because we say that the Terumah fell into the Terumah and the Chulin into the Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> This is only if there was more Chulin (in the basket) than a Se'ah (even if Terumah fell in, it is the minority).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is even if there is not more Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Granted, Reish Lakish requires a majority even for mid'Rabanan laws. However, how can R. Yochanan be lenient about an Isur mid'Oraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This Beraisa is like Chachamim (who say that Terumah is mid'Rabanan nowadays). R. Yochanan said above that R. Yosi holds that Terumah is mid'Oraisa nowadays:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">82b----------------------------------------82b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Seder Olam):</span> "That your fathers inherited, and you will inherit" - there was a first inheritance and a second, but not a third (i.e. the second Kedushah of Eretz Yisrael never ceased).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yosi taught Seder Olam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere, R. Yochanan requires a majority for mid'Rabanan Isurim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Mikveh had exactly 40 Sa'im, and a Se'ah (of fruit juice) was put in and a Se'ah was removed, it is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> (We may add and remove) until a majority.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yochanan requires that a majority remains. (Tosfos - this is only a Pesul mid'Rabanan regarding Temed. Alternatively, even regarding fruit juice, each Se'ah added is Batel, and mid'Oraisa it is Kosher.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, he requires that a majority is not removed (but half may be removed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Only regarding Terumah he does not require a majority, for we can make a favorable assumption (the Terumah fell into the Terumah).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS AN <i>ANDROGINUS</i> DEFINITELY A MALE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(On 81a, Reish Lakish said that an Androginus permits his wife to eat Terumah, but not Chazah v'Shok.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> An Androginus may marry (a woman. This shows that he is a Vadai male. If so, he should permit his wife to eat Chazah v'Shok)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It means, if he married...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says Nosei (he may marry)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> How will you explain 'Lo Nisa (a man may not marry him)'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (If he is a Vadai male, you must say that) that is b'Di'eved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Likewise, 'Nosei' is b'Di'eved!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No! He may marry a woman connotes l'Chatchilah, but even b'Di'eved he may not stay married to a man! (The question against Reish Lakish remains.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> In the Seifa, R. Eliezer is Mechayev a man who has Bi'ah with an Androginus like with a male. This implies that the first Tana is in doubt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree, that he is a Vadai male. They argue about whether or not one is Chayav Skilah (death by stoning) for Bi'ah in the place of his female genitals;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana is Mechayev. R. Eliezer is Mechayev only (for Bi'ah in the anus,) like with a normal male.</p>
