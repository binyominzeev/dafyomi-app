<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN IS ISUR CHAL AL ISUR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about Isur Kolel, according to R. Yosi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Chiya holds that R. Yosi is Mechayev twice for an Isur Kolel; Bar Kapara holds that he is Mechayev only once.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> What Isur Kolel is there here?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We understand the case of a Zar who served on Shabbos. He was permitted to do Melachah (before Shabbos) and forbidden to serve. When Shabbos came, he also became forbidden to do Melachah. The Isur applies to Avodah as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We understand the case of a Ba'al Mum who served b'Tum'ah. He was permitted to eat Kodshim and forbidden to serve. When he became Tamei, he became forbidden also to eat Kodshim; the Isur applies to Avodah as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>However, when a Zar ate Melikah, the Isurim come together, but it cannot be a case of Isur Kolel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, they argue about Isur Bas Achas (Isurim that come simultaneously), according to R. Yosi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Chiya holds that R. Yosi is Mechayev twice; Bar Kapara holds that he is Mechayev once.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can the first two cases be Isur Bas Achas?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding a Zar who served on Shabbos, the case is that he brought two hairs (after 13 years, and became an adult) on Shabbos. (All Isurim, including) Avodas Zar and Melachah on Shabbos take effect on him when he becomes an adult.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Likewise, if a Kohen Ba'al Mum was Tamei when he became an adult, the Isurim of Avodas Ba'al Mum and Avodah b'Tum'ah both come the moment he becomes an adult.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Alternatively, his finger was cut off with a Tamei knife, making him Tamei and blemished at the same time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Granted, R. Chiya learned from Rebbi how R. Yosi holds, and he can say that Rebbi taught Bar Kapara how R. Shimon holds (and Bar Kapara later got confused).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, how will Bar Kapara explain that R. Chiya heard Rebbi says that he is liable twice? (Bar Kapara says that even R. Yosi is Mechayev only once.) Would he say that R. Chiya is lying?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, they argue according to R. Shimon about Isur Bas Achas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, R. Chiya had to swear to show that R. Shimon holds unlike he usually does (he says Isur Chal Al Isur only regarding Isur Bas Achas).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, why did Bar Kapara have to swear?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Bar Kapara will say that Rebbi taught R. Chiya according to R. Yosi (and R. Chiya later got confused).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, how will R. Chiya explain that Bar Kapara heard Rebbi Mechayev once (since R. Chiya says that even R. Shimon is Mechayev twice)? Would he say that Bar Kapara is lying?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chiya will say that Rebbi taught only two cases of Isur Kolel, in which one is liable only once, according to R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Bar Kapara thought that the case of a Zar who ate Melikah is similar, so he joined it to the two teachings he heard from Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Later, (he thought that Rebbi taught him all three, and) he realized that the Isurim of Melikah always come together. He reasoned that the other two cases are also Isur Bas Achas, and all are liable only once.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> If a Zar served on Shabbos, and a Ba'al Mum Kohen served when Tamei, the former is liable for Avodas Zar and Melachah on Shabbos; the latter is liable for Avodas Ba'al Mum and Avodah b'Tum'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon says, the former is liable only for Avodas Zar; the latter is liable only for Avodas Ba'al Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa omitted the case of Melikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Due to which Tana was this case omitted (because it is inconsistent with his other teachings)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It was due to R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He is Mechayev twice for Isur Kolel, so all the more so for Isur Bas Achas!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was due to R. Shimon. He is Mechayev only once for Isur Kolel, but agrees that one is liable twice for Bas Achas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Bar Kapara is refuted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Avodah did the Zar do on Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It was not Shechitah, for a Zar is Kosher for Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It was not Kabalah and carrying the blood to the Mizbe'ach, for this is not a Melachah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It was not Haktarah (burning on the Mizbe'ach), for R. Yosi holds that burning (on Shabbos) is only a Lav!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> He slaughtered Par Kohen Gadol (of Yom Kipur), according to the opinion that a Zar may not do this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why do they discuss a Zar? Even a Kohen Hedyot may not do this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Zar refers to anyone who is foreign to (unqualified for) this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> (Really, he was Maktir.) The Beraisa did not say how many Chata'os must be brought, or how many Lavin were transgressed, rather, how many Isurim were transgressed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he transgressed two Isurim, he is buried among the utterly wicked.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ISURIM THAT CAN TAKE EFFECT TOGETHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two men were Mekadesh two women, and at the time of Chupah they switched wives, they are liable for Eshes Ish. If they are brothers, they are (also) liable for Eshes Ach. If the women are sisters, they are liable for Achos Ishto. If they were Nidos, they are liable for Nidah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We separate each woman (from her husband) for three months, lest she is pregnant (from the other man. Without separation, we would not know who is the father of children born withing nine months). If the women are minors, who cannot give birth, they return to their husbands immediately;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If they are Kohanos, they are disqualified from eating Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question #1:</span> 'They switched' connotes intentionally. Do we discuss Resha'im?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> R. Chiya taught that they bring (all together) 16 Chata'os. If they intentionally sinned, they do not bring Korbanos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah should read 'They were switched'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support #1 (Seifa):</span> If they were minors who cannot give birth, they are returned immediately.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they intentionally switched, they are forbidden to their husbands!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is no support. A minor who commits adultery is considered forced, so she is permitted to her husband (unless he is a Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support #2 (Reisha):</span> They separate for three months, in case they are pregnant. (We discuss adults.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If not for this concern (or after three months) they are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had they intentionally switched, they would be forbidden.</p></div>
