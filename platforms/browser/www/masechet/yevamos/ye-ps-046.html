<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A SLAVE WHO IMMERSED TO BECOME FREE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chama bar Gurya):</span> If one bought a slave from a Nochri and the slave immersed l'Shem Ben Chorin (to become a free convert), he succeeded.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is because the Nochri did not own the slave himself (just his earnings). The Yisrael cannot acquire more than the Nochri himself owned;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since the slave immersed to become free, this uproots his bondage, like Rava's law;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The following uproot Shi'abud (a lien, on an object or slave): making it Hekdesh, Shichrur (freeing a slave), and the Isur of Chametz on Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda - Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which a woman converted, and her slaves immersed before she did. Chachamim ruled that they are free.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had they immersed after her, they would not be free!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> No. Since they immersed before her, they are free even if they did not specify their intent. Had they immersed after her, they would be free only if they specified that they immerse l'Shem Ben Chorin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Avya):</span> This is only when a Yisrael buys from a Nochri. If one buys a Nochri himself, he acquires him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"...Mehem Tiknu" - you can buy them (to be slaves), but they cannot buy you, nor can they acquire one another.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what sense can a Nochri not acquire?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He cannot acquire (even rights to receive) earnings.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> An Eved Ivri can be sold "... O l'Eker <i>Mishpachas Ger</i>", i.e. to a Nochri!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, "Mehem Tiknu" discusses acquiring the person himself, and it says that a Yisrael can acquire a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha):</span> Perhaps he acquires only him through money and immersion (to become a slave), but before this, the Nochri may immerse l'Shem Ben Chorin!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One must hold the slave in the water.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Ashi wanted to immerse Minyamin to be his slave. He handed him over to Ravina and Rav Acha, and said that they will be held responsible if he immerses to convert.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They tied a chain around his neck, loosened it and tightened it.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>They loosened it, so it should not be a Chatzitzah (blockage that invalidates the immersion).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>They tightened it, so he would not be able to say that he immersed l'Shem Ben Chorin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>When they lifted his head from the water, they put a Kli of mud on his head and told him to take it to his master.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> People of Papa bar Aba's house pay people's taxes and use them as slaves. Do the slaves need a document of freedom when the servitude ends?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Had I died before telling you, there would be no one to tell you!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava citing Rav Sheshes):</span> The king says that one who does not pay his own tax is a slave to the one who pays for him (therefore, a document is needed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>R. Chiya bar Aba went to Gavla. He saw Benos Yisrael that became pregnant from Nochrim who were circumcised, but did not immerse. He saw Jews drinking wine mixed by Nochrim and eating lupines cooked by Nochrim. He did not say anything; he came to R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Go announce that their children are Mamzerim, their wine is Yayin Nesech (wine offered to idolatry, which is forbidden), and their lupines are Bishul Akum (food cooked by Nochrim, which is forbidden), since they are not Bnei Torah (they are prone to extrapolate and say that other things are similarly permitted).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan said that their children are Mamzerim. This is like his opinion that one is not a convert until he is circumcised and immerses, so the fathers were still Nochrim, and that the child of a Nochri or slave from a Bas Yisrael is a Mamzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Their wine is Yayin Nesech. We tell a Nazir to go far from a vineyard (i.e. distance yourself from possible transgression. Here also we distance them from Aveirah; the Nochrim mixed the wine without touching it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Their lupines are forbidden because they are not Bnei Torah, but Bnei Torah are permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Shmuel bar R. Yitzchak said that Bishul Akum does not apply to anything (normally) eaten raw. Lupines are not eaten raw!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan (Tosfos - also) holds like the other version of Rav Shmuel's teaching:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar R. Yitzchak):</span> Whatever does not come on the table of kings to be eaten with bread is permitted even if it was cooked by Nochrim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>Therefore, Bnei Torah are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE ESSENTIAL STEPS OF CONVERSION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If a convert was circumcised but did not immerse, he is a (valid) convert, since our forefathers (who left Mitzrayim) converted this way;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, if he immersed but was not circumcised he is a convert, since the women (of that generation) converted this way.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chachamim say, one is not enough by itself. He is not a convert until he circumcises and immerses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Yehoshua learn from the men, and why doesn't R. Eliezer learn from the women?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we do not learn what is possible (Milah of men) from what is impossible (Milah of women).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Eliezer does learn thusly!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> For all generations, Korban Pesach may not be brought from Ma'aser money. We learn this from the Pesach brought in Mitzrayim, which was not brought from Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Do we learn what is possible from what is impossible? (Ma'aser did not apply yet!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Yes! Even though it was impossible, we learn from it.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, all agree that immersion without circumcision is a proper conversion. They argue about circumcision without immersion;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Eliezer learns from the men that this suffices. R. Yehoshua disagrees, because the men also immersed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehoshua's source?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He learns from "...v'Kidashtam ha'Yom u'Machar v'Chibsu Simlosam". One must immerse himself even when he need not wash (immerse) his clothes (e.g. a Ba'al Keri), all the more so when he must wash his clothes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps they washed their clothes just for cleanliness!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Moshe took the blood and threw it on the people." We have a tradition that every Haza'ah (sprinkling) requires immersion first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehoshua's source that the mothers immersed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is logical. If not, what did they do to enter under Kanfei ha'Shechinah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> One is not a convert until he circumcises and immerses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. The Halachah follows the majority (Chachamim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Elsewhere, Chachamim's opinion is attributed to an individual, R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If a man says that he circumcised but did not immerse, we immerse him. We are not concerned for whether or not his circumcision was for the sake of conversion;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, we do not immerse him (without Hatafas Dam Bris, lest his Milah was not l'Shem Geirus).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Therefore, R. Yehudah permits immersing a convert on Shabbos, and R. Yosi forbids.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah holds that one act is enough. Obviously, if he is circumcised he may immerse on Shabbos! (since Tevilah is unnecessary, it is not Tikun (fixing him).) What do we learn from 'therefore'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that immersion is primary, so it is Tikun. The Seifa teaches that circumcision helps by itself, therefore he may immerse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it teach that R. Yosi forbids immersing a convert on Shabbos? Since he requires both, obviously Tevilah on Shabbos is Tikun and it is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he holds that circumcision is primary, and he forbids Tevilas Ger on Shabbos only if circumcision was not done in front of us, but not if we saw it. The Seifa teaches, he requires both and always forbids Tevilah on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CONDITIONS OF CONVERSION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> A case occurred in which a convert circumcised but did not immerse. R. Chiya bar Rebbi, R. Oshaya b'Ribi and R. Oshaya bar R. Chiya told him 'wait, and we will immerse you tomorrow.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We learn three laws from this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Conversion requires three judges;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One is not a convert until he circumcises and immerses;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We do not immerse converts at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we also learn that expert judges are required?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps it just happened that expert judges were there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Three judges are needed for conversion, since it is called 'Mishpat' (judgment; "U'Mishpat Echad Yihyeh Lachem vela'Ger" - Bamidbar 15:16).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHEN DO WE ACCEPT CONVERTS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah) Suggestion:</span> If a man claims to be a convert, perhaps we accept him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Itcha (with you)" - we accept him only if he is Muchzak (established) to you.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he brings witnesses with him, he is believed - "When a convert will dwell with you".</p></div>
