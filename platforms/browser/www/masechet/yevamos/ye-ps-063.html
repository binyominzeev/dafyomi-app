<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WITHOUT A WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One without a wife is not called Adam - "Male and female he created them, and he called their name Adam".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One without land is not called Adam - "... And the land he gave to Bnei Adam".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Elazar) Question:</span> How do we explain "I will make for him a <i>helper</i> against him"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> If he merits, she helps him. If not, she is against him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Contradiction (R. Elazar):</span> It is written "k'Negdo" (without a Yud, which allows us to read Nagdaso (she lashes him)), but we read (k'Negdo, which tolerates a Yud, i.e. as if it said) "Kenigdo" (opposite him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> If he merits, she is k'Negdo (an appropriate companion or helper). If not, she lashes him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi):</span> "I will make for him a helper" - how does a woman help a man?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Eliyahu):</span> A man brings (home) wheat and flax, but he does not chew wheat and wear flax! We see, she enlightens his eyes and stands him on his feet!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "This time, a bone from my bones, flesh from my flesh" - this teaches that Adam came to every animal, but his mind was not settled until he came to Chavah. (Gur Aryeh - he considered each animal as a possible mate. He did not have relations with them.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FARMING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "V'NiVReCHu (will be blessed) through you all families of the earth" - Hash-m told Avraham 'I have two BReCHos (graftings) to graft onto you - Rus the Moabite and Na'amah the Amonite;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"All families of the earth" - even families which dwell in the ground are only blessed because of Yisrael; (Ya'avetz, Torah Temimah - this alludes to those who do not dwell in houses, e.g. cavemen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"All nations of the land" - even ships that come from Galya to Aspamya are only blessed on account of Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> In the future, all craftsmen will become farmers - "All oarsmen will descend from their ships and all ship captains will stand on the ground."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> There is no lower profession than farming. It says "They will descend".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar saw a farmer plowing his field widthwise. He told him, 'Even if you will also plow lengthwise, business is more profitable.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav went among the sheaves; the wind was blowing them. 'As much as you can wave, business is more profitable.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who has 100 Zuz invested in business, can afford meat and wine every day. One with 100 Zuz of land will eat salt and fodder. Further, he must sleep on his land [to guard it], and comes to quarrels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Plant your own food, rather than buy it. Even though the price is the same, what you grow will be blessed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Sell what is in your house [and invest the money], and do not wax poor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This applies to things like carpets. Do not sell your cloak, lest you not find another one that fits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Seal a hole, without widening it [to make a nicer sealing]. If you insist that it look nice, widen it and seal it, but do not destroy and rebuild the wall, for anyone who builds is in danger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Be quick to buy land, but do not rush to marry a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Marry a woman below your standing; pick a friend above your level.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar bar Avina):</span> Punishments only come to the world because of Yisrael -  "I cut off nations, made desolate their towers, and destroyed their markets". "I said that you should fear Me; learn a lesson from this!"</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AN EVIL WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya (to Rav):</span> Hash-m should save you from something worse than death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav):</span> Is there such a thing?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Yes! "I find a wife harsher than death."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav's wife used to pain him. If he would ask her to make lentils, she would make legumes, and vice-versa. When Rav's son Chiya grew up, he told his mother the opposite of what Rav requested.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> Your mother has improved (she fulfills my request)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chiya:</span> I switched your request.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> This is as people say, you will learn from your children! (I should request the opposite of what I want.) However, you should not do so (lie about what I said) - "They trained their tongues to speak falsely..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Chiya's wife used to pain him. When he would find something (that she would like), he would wrap it in his turban and bring it for her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> Why do you do this? She pains you! (Rav wanted to learn how R. Chiya was able to return good in place of evil.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> It suffices for us that our wives raise our children and save us from sin.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Yehudah taught to his son (Rav Yitzchak) "I find a wife harsher than death".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yitzchak:</span> Who exemplifies this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Your mother does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yehudah also taught to his son that a person finds peace of mind only from his first wife - "Rejoice in the wife of your youth". He told Rav Yitzchak that his mother exemplifies this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She instigates, but she is easily appeased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of an evil wife?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> She prepares the food, and a mouth (of curses).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> She prepares the food, and turns her back. (Rashi - she does not eat with him. Tzitz Eliezer - the Rambam explains that this is a euphemism for withdrawing at the time of Bi'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama bar Chanina):</span> When a person marries a wife, his sins MisPaKekin (are plugged up and do not prosecute against him) - "Motza Ishah Motza Tov v'YiFaK Ratzon me'Hashem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>In Eretz Yisrael, when a man married they would say to him 'Motza or Motzei';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Motza - "One who found a wife, found good";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Motzei - "I find the wife worse than death." (Chasam Sofer - the message is that even if she will pain him, he found good, for wives raise children (enabling him to learn) and save their husbands from sin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is a Mitzvah to divorce an evil wife - "Divorce the scoffer, expel quarrels and disgrace." (Chasam Sofer - Rav and R. Chiya did not divorce their wives because they were righteous in other respects.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The solution for an evil wife with a large Kesuvah is to marry a Tzarah, like people say, 'another woman (a Tzarah makes a wife fix her ways), and not a thorn'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> An evil wife is as bad as a day of hail and wind - "The drip annoys on a day of hail, and a quarrelsome wife is as bad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> See how good is a good wife, and how bad is a evil wife:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If "One who found a wife, found good" discusses a good wife, the verse praises her;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the verse refers to Torah, this shows that a good wife is a parable for Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If "I find the wife worse than death" discusses an evil wife, the verse disparages her;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it refers to Gehinom, this shows that an evil wife is a parable for Gehinom!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> "Behold I bring an evil you cannot escape" refers to an evil wife with a large Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> "Hash-m put me in the hands of one from whom I cannot get up" - this is an evil wife with a large Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Eretz Yisrael they say that this is one who must buy (for he does not grow) his food.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PUNISHMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan bar Rava):</span> "Your sons and daughters are given to another nation" - this is the wife of the father. (She will raise his children from a previous wife.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav Chanan bar Rava):</span> "With Naval (a repulsive) nation I will anger them" refers to an evil wife with a large Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (R. Elazar):</span> It refers to Tzedukim - "The Naval said in his heart, there is not Hash-m".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #3 (Beraisa):</span> These are the people of Barberiya and Tartenai, who walk unclothed in the market. There is nothing more repulsive to Hash-m than this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #4 (R. Yochanan):</span> These are Chaverim (Tosfos and Rashi elsewhere - an ethnic group that corrupted the Persians).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When they told R. Yochanan that Chaverim came to Bavel, he bent and fell.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When they told him that they accept bribes, he straightened up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Malchus Bavel made three decrees. They corresponded to three sins of Yisrael:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They decreed not to eat slaughtered meat, because Yisrael did not give Matanos (the foreleg, jaw and stomach) of slaughtered animals to Kohanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They decreed against bathhouses, because Yisrael were not careful about Tevilah;.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They dug up graves, because Yisrael rejoiced on pagan festivals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>(Rabah bar Shmuel) "The hand of Hash-m will be upon you and your fathers" - this is the digging up of graves;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They dig up the dead due to sins of the living.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If "They will not be gathered and will not be buried; they will be as fertilizer on the ground", how can it be that "Death will be preferred to life"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Mari):</span> Death is better for the wicked, so they will not live and sin in this world and fall in Gehinom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Sefer ben Sira):</span> A good wife is a good gift to her husband; Good will be given in the lap of one who fears Hash-m;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An evil wife is Tzara'as for her husband. His cure is to divorce her and heal himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Happy is the husband of a good wife! His days are doubled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Hide your eyes from a charming Eshes Ish, lest you get caught in her trap. Do not befriend her husband, for many were corrupted and killed by her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Perfume peddlers incite immorality like a spark ignites a coal. They have many wounds (from irate husbands). Their houses are full of deception like a nest is full of fowl.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Do not worry about tomorrow, for you do not know what the day will bring. Perhaps one will not be alive tomorrow, and he worried over a world which is not his!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Do not allow the multitude into your house. Many should seek peace with you, but reveal your secrets to only one out of 1000.</p>
