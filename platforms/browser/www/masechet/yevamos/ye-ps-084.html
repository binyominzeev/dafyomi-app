<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The following animals do not become Kodesh or make Kodesh (this will be explained):</p></div>

It does not make Kodesh through Temurah (even if it was born to a Korban and one said that another animal should be in place of it, the latter animal remains Chulin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> One is Chayav Skilah for Bi'ah with an Androginus like with a male.</p></div>

Elazar ben Shamu'a, his Talmidim allowed me to learn from him only one thing in our Mishnah, that R. Eliezer says that one is liable for Bi'ah with an Androginus, like with a male.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Because he married her, she is forbidden by an Aseh (she is not a virgin) and a Lav. Had he only been Mekadesh her, the Aseh of Yibum overrides the Lav of a widow to a Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Our entire Perek discusses women forbidden only by a Lav, and the Aseh of Yibum does not override the Lav!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Seifa discusses a Kohen Gadol who married a widow (therefore we also taught Nisu'in in the Reisha);</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OMISSIONS OF THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> According to Rav Dimi, who said that the child of a (Mitzri) Sheni from a Rishonah is a Sheni, the Mishnah should also have taught the following case:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Sheni married two Mitzriyos, a Rishonah and a Sheniyah, and had a son from each, they are a Sheni and a Shelishi, respectively;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one of the sons marry women proper for themselves (A Mitzris Sheniyah and Bas Yisrael, respectively), they (their wives) are permitted to their husbands and forbidden to their Yevamim. (Tosfos - really, the Sheniyah is permitted to both, for Kahal Gerim Lo Ikri Kahal. The Bas Yisrael is forbidden to her Yavam. Rashi explains like the simple meaning. The Rashash and Sha'ar ha'Melech questioned this.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If each son marries a woman proper for his brother, they are (Tosfos - the Bas Yisrael is) forbidden to their husbands and permitted their Yevamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>A convert is permitted to both [her husband and her Yavam]. An Ailonis [forbidden to her husband, e.g. a Sheniyah married to a Shelishi, or a Bas Yisrael to a Sheni) is forbidden to both.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana omitted this case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, surely he omitted another case. What is it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He omitted a Petzu'a Daka.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not an omission. It is Chayavei Lavin, and Chayavei Lavin were already taught!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Multiple cases of Chayavei Lavin were taught!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support #1:</span> After teaching about a regular Kohen who married a widow, it also teaches a Chalal who married a Kesherah (even though the latter does not teach anything new).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, that case is needed to teach Rav Yehudah's law:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A Kesherah (Bas Kohen) is permitted to a Chalal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support #2:</span> After teaching about a Chalal who married a Kesherah, it also teaches a Yisrael who married a Bas Yisrael and has a brother who is a Mamzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> No, it was necessary to teach Chayavei Lavin that are Shavah b'Chol (apply to all of Yisrael), and Lavim that are not (e.g. Isurei Kohanim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It also teaches about a Yisrael who married a Mamzeres and has a brother who is a Yisrael (this is also Shavah b'Chol)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> This shows that extra cases were taught even if they teach nothing new. The Tana did not teach every case that could have been taught (so we can say that he also omitted Mitzri brothers).</p></div>
