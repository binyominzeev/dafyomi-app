<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS SPITTING ESSENTIAL?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (from Rejection 4:b, and defense of Answer #1):</span> R. Akiva holds that spitting forbids Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If she removed the shoe but did not spit or recite the verses, the Chalitzah is valid. If she spit but did not remove the shoe or recite, the Chalitzah is Pasul. If she recited but did not spit or remove the shoe, there is nothing to be concerned for.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who taught this Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says that if she removed the shoe but did not spit or recite the verses, the Chalitzah is valid. R. Eliezer learns from "So will be done" that every action is Me'akev!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it is like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that if she spit but did not remove the shoe or recite the verses, the Chalitzah is Pasul. To whom is it Pasul?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot mean that it is Pasul to permit her to strangers. Obviously, such a Chalitzah does not permit her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Rather, it is Pasul and forbids her to the brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Akiva, why is she disqualified when she just spits, but not for just reciting the verses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Verses are recited both before and after removing the shoe, so one who sees her reciting will not assume that she already removed the shoe;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="note"><span class="notewd">Note:</span> Seemingly, one who hears the latter Keri'ah "Kachah Ya'aseh la'Ish..." will assume that she already removed the shoe! Mahari Bruna (30) mentions this. He says (Teshuvah 33) "all Keri'ah is one." Perhaps this means that one who hears can attribute that she erred, and recited both verses together, i.e. before Chalitzah. If normally Beis Din is Makri (recites the verses, and the Yevamah and Yavam repeat them), it is reasonable to assume here that she erred, for Beis Din was not Makri.</span></p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Spitting is done only after removing the shoe. One who sees her spit will assume that she already took off the shoe, and (if she would do Yibum) they will think that one may do Yibum after Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rabanan (to Shmuel's father):</span> If a Yevamah spat, she takes off the shoe, and she need not spit again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A Yevamah came in front of R. Ami. She spit before taking off the shoe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> She should take off the shoe, and she will be finished.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> She must spit!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> She already spat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> Let her spit again. It can't hurt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> A calamity may result if she spits again. People will say that the first spitting has no effect, and they will permit a Chalutzah to do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> The events must be done in order!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> The order is not essential.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Aba thought that R. Ami was pushing him off (with a false answer). He later found that the answer was correct.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Whether the shoe was removed before she spit or afterwards, what was done, was done.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CAN A DECREE BE REPEALED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (to Levi):</span> Can a woman without hands do Chalitzah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If a Yevamah spit blood, was she Yotzei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> "... That is written in truth" - is there writing (in Shamayim) that is not truthful?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Levi could not answer. He asked in the Beis Medrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beis Medrash):</span> It doesn't say that she will take off his shoe with her hand (therefore, a woman without hands can do Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It doesn't say that she will spit [only] saliva (if she spat blood, surely saliva was mixed with it, so, she was Yotzei)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "That is written in truth" refers to a decree about which Hash-m swore; it cannot be repealed. A decree that He did not swear about can be repealed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Ami):</span> A decree with an oath is not torn up - "Therefore I swore to the house of Eli, that their sin will never be atoned with animal or flour offerings".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> It will never be atoned with animal or flour offerings, but it may be atoned through Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> It will never be atoned with animal or flour offerings, but it may be atoned through bestowing Chesed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rabah and Abaye were from the house of Eli. Rabah engaged in Torah and lived 40 years; Abaye engaged in Torah and Chesed, and lived 60 years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There was a family in Yerushalayim in which people were dying at the age of 18.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> Perhaps you are from the house of Eli - "V'Chol Marbis Beischa Yamusu Anashim". Go engage in Torah, and live!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They engaged in Torah and lived - they called the family Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shmuel bar Unya):</span> What is the source that a decree against a Tzibur is not sealed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be! It says "Ki Im Techabsi... Nichtam Avonech Lefanai"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, what is the source that even if a decree is sealed, it can be torn up?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Who is like Hash-m Elokeinu, whenever we call to Him".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> It also says "Seek Hash-m when He is to be found" (this implies that sometimes we cannot find Him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> An individual cannot always find Him, but a Tzibur can.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When can an individual find Him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Avuha):</span> This is during the 10 days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>YEVAMAH</i> WHO SPAT BLOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabanan, to Shmuel's father):</span> If a Yevamah spat blood she must do Chalitzah (and not Yibum). Certainly, there were drops of saliva with the blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps blood that comes from a Zav's mouth or Ever is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "His flow (is Tamei)", but not blood that comes from his mouth or Ever. (If the blood contains saliva, it should be Tamei!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If she draws the spit from her throat, there will be saliva in the blood. If it flows from her mouth, there might not be.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>CHALITZAH</i> OF A MINOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Yavam was deaf (...or a minor, the Chalitzah is invalid, and disqualifies her from doing Yibum).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">105b----------------------------------------105b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is like R. Meir, but Chachamim say, the Chalitzah of a minor has no effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Ketanah did Chalitzah (it is Pasul).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is like R. Meir, who learns from "Ish" that the Yavam must be an adult, and he equates her law to his. Chachamim say, "Ish" teaches that he must be an adult, but she may be an adult or minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are the Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like R. Yosi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chiya and R. Shimon bar Rebbi were sitting. One said that one who prays must look down (towards the Shechinah in Eretz Yisrael) - "My eyes and heart will always be there";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The other said, his eyes should face up - "We will lift our hearts to our hands".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael bar R. Yosi:</span> My father said, his eyes should be down, and his heart up, to fulfill both verses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rebbi came to the Beis Medrash. R. Yishmael bar R. Yosi walked slowly to his place.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Avdan (a Talmid of Rebbi):</span> Who is this, who (looks like he) steps on the heads of the Holy nation?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael bar R. Yosi:</span> It is me, Yishmael bar R. Yosi. I came to learn Torah from Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Avdan:</span> Are you proper to learn Torah from Rebbi?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael bar R. Yosi:</span> Was Moshe proper to learn from Hash-m?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Avdan:</span> Are you Moshe?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael bar R. Yosi:</span> Is your Rebbi Hash-m?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Rebbi received his punishment (for not objecting to Avdan's treatment of R. Yishmael). He was called <i>your</i> Rebbi, i.e. but not my Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>A Yevamah came in front of Rebbi (to do Chalitzah). He told Avdan to check whether or not she is an adult. Avdan left.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael bar R. Yosi:</span> My father said that the Torah says "Ish" to teach that the Yavam must be an adult, but she may be an adult or minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> There is no need to check her. The elder has already ruled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>Avdan was returning to his place.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael bar R. Yosi:</span> One who is needed by the Holy nation, may step on the heads of the Holy nation. One who is not needed by the Holy nation, how can he step on the heads of the Holy nation?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi (to Avdan):</span> Stay in your place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Just then, Avdan became a Metzora, his two sons drowned, and his two daughters-in-law did Mi'un.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> Blessed is Hash-m, Who embarrassed Avdan in this world (so he will not be embarrassed in the world to come)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> From R. Yosi, we learn that a Yevamah may do Chalitzah from the age of Pa'utos (six to 10, depending on how sharp she is - Gitin 59a. Here, Rashi says six or seven.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> She must reach the age of vows (one year before adulthood. If she understands vows, her vows take effect).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>The Halachah is, she must bring two hairs (of adulthood).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>HOW MANY JUDGES ARE NEEDED?</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah does not follow this pair (of Tana'im, i.e. R. Shimon and R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Nachman already taught this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Chalitzah requires three judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had Rav Nachman said only that three are required, we might have thought that this is l'Chatchilah, but b'Di'eved, two suffice. Therefore, he needed to rule unlike the pair;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had Rav Nachman said only that the Halachah does not follow law the pair, rather, the first Tana Mishnah (that three are enough), one might have thought that this is b'Di'eved, but l'Chatchilah, five are needed.

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A case occurred (and a Yavam and Yevamah did Chalitzah by themselves in jail...)</p>
