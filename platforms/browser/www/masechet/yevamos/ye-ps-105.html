<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IS SPITTING ESSENTIAL?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (from Rejection 4:b, and defense of Answer #1):</span> R. Akiva holds that spitting forbids Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If she removed the shoe but did not spit or recite the verses, the Chalitzah is valid. If she spit but did not remove the shoe or recite, the Chalitzah is Pasul. If she recited but did not spit or remove the shoe, there is nothing to be concerned for.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who taught this Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says that if she removed the shoe but did not spit or recite the verses, the Chalitzah is valid. R. Eliezer learns from "So will be done" that every action is Me'akev!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it is like R. Akiva.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that if she spit but did not remove the shoe or recite the verses, the Chalitzah is Pasul. To whom is it Pasul?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot mean that it is Pasul to permit her to strangers. Obviously, such a Chalitzah does not permit her!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>Rather, it is Pasul and forbids her to the brothers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Akiva, why is she disqualified when she just spits, but not for just reciting the verses?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Verses are recited both before and after removing the shoe, so one who sees her reciting will not assume that she already removed the shoe;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="note"><span>Note:</span> Seemingly, one who hears the latter Keri'ah "Kachah Ya'aseh la'Ish..." will assume that she already removed the shoe! Mahari Bruna (30) mentions this. He says (Teshuvah 33) "all Keri'ah is one." Perhaps this means that one who hears can attribute that she erred, and recited both verses together, i.e. before Chalitzah. If normally Beis Din is Makri (recites the verses, and the Yevamah and Yavam repeat them), it is reasonable to assume here that she erred, for Beis Din was not Makri.</span></p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Spitting is done only after removing the shoe. One who sees her spit will assume that she already took off the shoe, and (if she would do Yibum) they will think that one may do Yibum after Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rabanan (to Shmuel's father):</span> If a Yevamah spat, she takes off the shoe, and she need not spit again.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>A Yevamah came in front of R. Ami. She spit before taking off the shoe.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> She should take off the shoe, and she will be finished.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> She must spit!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> She already spat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> Let her spit again. It can't hurt!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> A calamity may result if she spits again. People will say that the first spitting has no effect, and they will permit a Chalutzah to do Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> The events must be done in order!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> The order is not essential.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Aba thought that R. Ami was pushing him off (with a false answer). He later found that the answer was correct.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Whether the shoe was removed before she spit or afterwards, what was done, was done.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CAN A DECREE BE REPEALED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (to Levi):</span> Can a woman without hands do Chalitzah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If a Yevamah spit blood, was she Yotzei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> "... That is written in truth" - is there writing (in Shamayim) that is not truthful?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Levi could not answer. He asked in the Beis Medrash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beis Medrash):</span> It doesn't say that she will take off his shoe with her hand (therefore, a woman without hands can do Chalitzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It doesn't say that she will spit [only] saliva (if she spat blood, surely saliva was mixed with it, so, she was Yotzei)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "That is written in truth" refers to a decree about which Hash-m swore; it cannot be repealed. A decree that He did not swear about can be repealed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Ami):</span> A decree with an oath is not torn up - "Therefore I swore to the house of Eli, that their sin will never be atoned with animal or flour offerings".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> It will never be atoned with animal or flour offerings, but it may be atoned through Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> It will never be atoned with animal or flour offerings, but it may be atoned through bestowing Chesed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Rabah and Abaye were from the house of Eli. Rabah engaged in Torah and lived 40 years; Abaye engaged in Torah and Chesed, and lived 60 years.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There was a family in Yerushalayim in which people were dying at the age of 18.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> Perhaps you are from the house of Eli - "V'Chol Marbis Beischa Yamusu Anashim". Go engage in Torah, and live!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They engaged in Torah and lived - they called the family Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shmuel bar Unya):</span> What is the source that a decree against a Tzibur is not sealed?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be! It says "Ki Im Techabsi... Nichtam Avonech Lefanai"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, what is the source that even if a decree is sealed, it can be torn up?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Who is like Hash-m Elokeinu, whenever we call to Him".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> It also says "Seek Hash-m when He is to be found" (this implies that sometimes we cannot find Him)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> An individual cannot always find Him, but a Tzibur can.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When can an individual find Him?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Avuha):</span> This is during the 10 days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A YEVAMAH WHO SPAT BLOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan, to Shmuel's father):</span> If a Yevamah spat blood she must do Chalitzah (and not Yibum). Certainly, there were drops of saliva with the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps blood that comes from a Zav's mouth or Ever is Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "His flow (is Tamei)", but not blood that comes from his mouth or Ever. (If the blood contains saliva, it should be Tamei!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If she draws the spit from her throat, there will be saliva in the blood. If it flows from her mouth, there might not be.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>CHALITZAH OF A MINOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Yavam was deaf (...or a minor, the Chalitzah is invalid, and disqualifies her from doing Yibum).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">105b----------------------------------------105b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is like R. Meir, but Chachamim say, the Chalitzah of a minor has no effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Ketanah did Chalitzah (it is Pasul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is like R. Meir, who learns from "Ish" that the Yavam must be an adult, and he equates her law to his. Chachamim say, "Ish" teaches that he must be an adult, but she may be an adult or minor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are the Chachamim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like R. Yosi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Chiya and R. Shimon bar Rebbi were sitting. One said that one who prays must look down (towards the Shechinah in Eretz Yisrael) - "My eyes and heart will always be there";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The other said, his eyes should face up - "We will lift our hearts to our hands".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yishmael bar R. Yosi:</span> My father said, his eyes should be down, and his heart up, to fulfill both verses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Rebbi came to the Beis Medrash. R. Yishmael bar R. Yosi walked slowly to his place.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Avdan (a Talmid of Rebbi):</span> Who is this, who (looks like he) steps on the heads of the Holy nation?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yishmael bar R. Yosi:</span> It is me, Yishmael bar R. Yosi. I came to learn Torah from Rebbi.</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Rebbi received his punishment (for not objecting to Avdan's treatment of R. Yishmael). He was called <i>your</i> Rebbi, i.e. but not my Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>A Yevamah came in front of Rebbi (to do Chalitzah). He told Avdan to check whether or not she is an adult. Avdan left.</p></div>
