<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A SON WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHICH IS HIS FATHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If both of them were Kohanim...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the son wounded or cursed one possible father and then the other, or both at once, he is killed;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if he wounded or cursed both at once, he is killed. If not, he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If he wounded or cursed them at once, he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about R. Yehudah's opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for the opinion that exempts?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> The Torah discusses cursing Hash-m, and cursing a parent. Just like one is liable for cursing Hash-m alone, one is liable for cursing one parent alone (and this is impossible here);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We equate wounding to cursing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He goes to the Mikdash with the Mishmar of each father (but does not get a share of Kodshim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since he does not get a share, why does he go?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is no question. He goes to do a Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, why does it say 'he goes up (i.e. he must)', as opposed to '<i>if</i> he went up...'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Acha bar Chanina):</span> He must go up to avoid blemishing the family.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If both fathers are in the same Mishmar...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When they are from different Mishmaros he receives no share, since each Mishmar can dispel him by saying '(perhaps) you are from the other Mishmar'. Also when they are from the same Mishmar, each Beis Av can dispel him! (Each Mishmar is divided into six Batei Av; each serves a different day.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> If the fathers are from the same Mishmar and Beis Av, he receives one portion.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK MITZVAS CHALITZAH</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT MAKES A VALID CHALITZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Mitzvah of Chalitzah is with three judges, even if all are commoners;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If Chalitzah was done with a Min'al (a soft leather shoe), it is Kesherah. If it was done with Anpilya (a slipper or sock), it is invalid. If it was done with a sandal that has a heel, it is Kesherah; if it has no heel, it is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>From the knee and below, it is Kesherah; from the knee and above, it is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If he did Chalitzah with a sandal that is not his, or a sandal of idolatry, or of wood, or a left sandal on his right foot, it is Kesherah. If the sandal was big but he could walk with it, or small, but it covered the majority of his foot, it is Kesherah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Since three commoners suffice, why does the Mishnah say 'judges'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches that we require three who can help the Yavam and Yevamah to recite the proper verses, like judges can.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Our Mishnah teaches like the following Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Mitzvah of Chalitzah is with three who can help them recite the verses, like judges;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it is with five.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of the first Tana?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Zekenim" must be at least two. A Beis Din never has an even number, so we add one.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it says "Ziknei" and "Zekenim", making four. To avoid an even number, we add one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the first Tana learn from Ziknei"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that even commoners may be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah learns this from the fact that it says "l'Einei (ha'Zekenim)".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We learned that "l'Einei" excludes blind people. If we required judges, we would not need a verse to exclude blind people!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Just like Beis Din must be clean in righteousness, they must be clean from any blemish - "You are totally beautiful, my beloved; there is no blemish in you."</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">101b----------------------------------------101b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the first Tana learn from "l'Einei"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches like Rava taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "She will spit l'Einei ha'Zekenim" - the judges must see the spit leave the Yevamah's mouth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah also needs to expound this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is his source that commoners suffice?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "b'Yisrael" - any Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from "b'Yisrael"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches like Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah taught, "b'Yisrael" - in a Beis Din of Yisrael, and not in a Beis Din of converts.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah learns this from another occurrence of the word "(Va'Yikra Shemo) b'Yisrael (Beis Chalutz ha'Na'al)".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim expound that "b'Yisrael" to teach as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A Chalitzah was done in front of R. Tarfon. He told everyone to say, "The one whose shoe was removed".</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehudah learns this from "And his name will be called".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HOW MANY JUDGES ARE REQUIRED FOR CHALIZTAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so (we learn two judges from "Zekenim"), all should expound "They will call to him" to require two more judges, and "They will speak to him" to require two more, making nine in all according to R. Yehudah, and seven according to Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Those words teach different laws:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"They will call to him" - and not their messenger;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"They will speak to him" - they give him good counsel;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he is young and she is old, or vice-versa, they tell him not to do Yibum. Rather, he should marry someone his own age, and not bring quarrels into his home.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava citing Rav Nachman):</span> The law is, Chalitzah is done in front of three, since a Stam (anonymous) Mishnah says this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If so, the same should apply to Mi'un!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mi'un and Chalitzah are done in front of three.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is the Halachah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> Mi'un requires a Beis Din of expert judges;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, it may be done in Beis Din or out of Beis Din;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Both agree that three are required;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah and R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi say, two suffice.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows them (two suffice).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There is only one Stam Mishnah about Mi'un. There are two Stam Mishnayos about Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> There also, there are two Stam Mishnayos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she did Mi'un or Chalitzah in front of a judge he may marry her, for he is part of a Beis Din (of three, therefore we do not suspect that he permitted her in order to marry her).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, there are only two Stam Mishnayos about Mi'un, but there are three about Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> What difference does it make if there is one, two or three Stam Mishnayos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Rather, Rav Nachman said that three suffice because even R. Yehudah retracted and agreed to this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> Semichah (leaning on the Korban for a mistaken ruling of the Sanhedrin; alternatively, ordination) of judges and Eglah Arufah (beheading a calf to atone for a murder) require three judges;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, they require five;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chalitzah and Mi'un require three.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yehudah does not argue about Chalitzah. We must say that he retracted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The judges must fix a place for Chalitzah - "His Yevamah will ascend to the gate to the elders".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua supervised a Chalitzah with five judges.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like R. Yehudah, but he retracted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They used five to publicize the matter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Rav Kahana asked Rav Ashi to be one of five judges for Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> Once, Rav Yehudah asked me to be one of five judges for Chalitzah</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Why are five needed?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> This is to publicize the matter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>Rav Yehudah asked Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah to be one of five judges for Chalitzah, to publicize the matter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah:</span> "B'Yisrael" requires a Beis Din of Yisrael, not of converts, and I am a convert!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> I would force someone to pay money on the word of someone as honest as Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be! "According to two witnesses a matter will be established"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, I would not allow collection of a document (Rashi; Tosfos - without an oath) if he said that the document was paid.</p></div>
