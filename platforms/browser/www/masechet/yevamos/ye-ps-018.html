<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p><i>ZIKAH</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, if so, one might have thought that is only when she is alive, but that Zikah ends after she dies;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, he taught that Zikah does not vanish.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yehudah - Mishnah):</span> If a Yevamah died, the Yavam may marry her sister.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Her sister is permitted, but not her mother!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he may even marry her mother. Since the Reisha permits Achos Ishto after the wife dies, the Seifa also discusses her sister.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna bar Chiya - Mishnah):</span> If he gave her a Ma'amar and died, the second widow does Chalitzah but not Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he not given a Ma'amar, the second widow could do even Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Yesh Zikah, she should be like the Tzarah of Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo (which is forbidden)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> No, even if no Ma'amar was given, she may not do Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah discusses a Ma'amar to oppose Beis Shamai, who say that a Ma'amar fully acquires a Yevamah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If a man died without children, and before his brother Shimon was able to give a Ma'amar to the Yevamah, another brother was born, and then Shimon died, the first widow is exempt, for she is Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo. The second widow does Chalitzah or Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Yesh Zikah, through Zikah she is Tzaras Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo (and should be forbidden)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Meir, who holds that Ein Zikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir does not hold that Ein Zikah! (The following Stam Mishnah is assumed to be like R. Meir.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two of four brothers were married to sisters, and these two died, the sisters do Chalitzah but not Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If R. Meir holds that Ein Zikah, since they fall from different brothers, it should be permitted for each surviving brother to do Yibum with one sister!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he holds that Ein Zikah. However, it is forbidden to uproot the Mitzvah of Yibum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we wait for one Yavam to do Yibum, perhaps the other Yavam will die (and the other widow will be exempt without Yibum or Chalitzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he holds that Ein Zikah, he should allow the Mitzvah to be uprooted, just like R. Gamliel!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Gamliel):</span> (If Rachel (a minor) was married mid'Rabanan to Reuven, and her sister fell to him to Yibum,) if Rachel did Mi'un, fine (Leah may do Yibum). If not, Leah waits (Tosfos - Rachel waits to have Bi'ah with Reuven) until Rachel becomes an adult, and the marriage becomes mid'Oraisa (after they have Bi'ah), and Leah is exempt from Yibum or Chalitzah for she is Reuven's Achos Ishto.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is no question. Perhaps R. Meir disagrees with R. Gamliel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is unreasonable that R. Meir is concerned <i>perhaps</i> the Mitzvah will be uprooted, and R. Gamliel is not concerned even when it is certainly uprooted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is not so! Perhaps one Tana is not concerned even when the Mitzvah is definitely uprooted, but the other is concerned even when it may be uprooted!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>RAV YEHUDAH'S SOURCE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Rav Yehudah learned (that Yesh Zikah) from Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah ben Beseirah):</span> If a Yavam was Mekadesh the sister of his Yevamah, we tell him not to marry her until his brother does Yibum or Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah ben Beseirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Even if Rav Yehudah learned this from Rav (his other Rebbi), it would not be difficult (even though Rav Huna said that Rav holds that Ein Zikah). We could say that Amora'im disagree about Rav's opinion!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Since Shmuel explicitly said that Yesh Zikah, it is better to say that Rav Yehudah received this from Shmuel, rather than to say that Amora'im argue about Rav's opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid):</span> Rav Yehudah explicitly said in the name of Shmuel that after the Yevamah dies, the Yavam may not marry her mother.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This is consistent with Shmuel's ruling that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah ben Beseirah. It was necessary to say both of these:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had he taught only that Yesh Zikah, one might have thought that this is only when there is only one brother. He ruled like R. Yehudah to teach that Yesh Zikah even when there are more brothers;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had he taught only that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah, one might have thought that this is only while the Yevamah is alive, but after she dies, the Zikah vanishes (and the Yavam may marry her mother). Therefore he taught that Zikah does not go away by itself.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ESHES ACHIV SHE'LO HAYAH B'OLAMO</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven died, and Shimon did Yibum with Chanah. Levi (another brother) was born, and Shimon died. Chanah is exempt, for she is Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo. Leah (Shimon's other wife) is exempt, because she is Chanah's Tzarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If Shimon gave a Ma'amar and died, Leah does Chalitzah but not Yibum;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon says, Levi may do Yibum or Chalitzah with either woman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Oshaya):</span> R. Shimon argues even in the previous Mishnah (when Levi was born before Yibum was done).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>He learns this from the Reisha (17a);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Reisha is not needed to teach about Chachamim. They forbid even when Levi was born after Yibum and entered the world when Chanah was 'permitted' (to do Yibum with him if she will be widowed), all the more so if he was born before Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, it teaches that R. Shimon argues even in such a case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Our Mishnah teaches the extremity of Chachamim (they forbid even when Levi was born after Yibum).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Really, R. Shimon should explicitly argue in the Reisha. He waited until Chachamim finished their laws before giving his opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Shimon, when is Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This is when a man dies without brothers, and then a brother is born.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This is when there were two brothers, one died, a third brother was born and the surviving brother did not do Yibum or die. (However, if he did, it is as if she falls from the latter brother and R. Shimon permits.).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why R. Shimon permits when Levi was born after Yibum. When he entered the world, Chanah was permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, when he was born before Yibum, why may he do Yibum?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon holds that Yesh Zikah, so it is as if Shimon did Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> R. Shimon is unsure whether or not Zikah with a Ma'amar is like having done Yibum. Does he have a doubt about Zikah alone?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If three brothers were married to three unrelated women and one man died, and a brother gave a Ma'amar and died, the widows do Chalitzah but not Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"And <i>one</i> of them died" - Yibum applies when there is Zikah from one Yavam, but not from two;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, the remaining brother may do Yibum or Chalitzah with whichever woman he wants;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He cannot do Yibum with both. Perhaps Yesh Zikah, and it is as if both Yevamos fell from one brother.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>He cannot do Yibum with one, and exempt the other. Perhaps Zikah is not like Yibum, and the two Yevamos fell from different brothers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>This shows that R. Shimon is in doubt whether or not Zikah is like Yibum.</p></div>
