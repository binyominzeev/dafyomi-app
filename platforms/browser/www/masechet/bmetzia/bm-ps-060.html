<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MIXING <i>PEROS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sells Peros of a field (Aleph), he may not mix with it Peros of field Beis, even if the Peros of both are new, all the more so if that of Aleph is old (which is preferable) and that of Beis is new.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Really, they permitted to mix hard wine with soft, for this improves (soft) wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>It is forbidden to mix dregs into wine, but he gives him its dregs (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If water was mixed into wine, one may not sell it in a store without informing the buyer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not sell it to a merchant, even if he informs him, for he will sell it without saying that it was mixed with water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>In a place where people dilute wine with water, this is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A merchant mixes together what he buys from different granaries or winepresses, on condition that he does not intend to mix (inferior Peros with superior, and to call it superior).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Obviously, if new Peros sell for four Sa'im for a Sela and old for three Sa'im for a Sela, he may not mix them (and say that it is old);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if new Peros sell for three Sa'im for a Sela and old for four Sa'im for a Sela, he may not mix them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The new is more expensive only because it can be kept longer. If the buyer wants to use it soon, the old is better for him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MIXING WINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Really, they permitted to mix hard wine with soft, for this improves it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> This teaches that whenever the Mishnah says 'really', that is the Halachah. (Rashi - since it gives the reason, there is no room for doubt; Rambam - the Halachah is a tradition from Moshe from Sinai.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Mishnah discusses at the times of pressing the grapes (but afterwards, it harms the wine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Nowadays, people mix afterwards!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> People know this, and they pardon it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> The Mishnah is R. Acha;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Acha):</span> One may mix something that people taste before buying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not mix dregs into wine, but he gives him (mixes in) its dregs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is self-contradictory!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He may give him the dregs if he informs him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Reisha):</span> (If water was mixed into wine), one may not sell it in a store without informing the buyer. One may not sell it to a wine merchant, even if he informs him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Until now, the Mishnah discusses without informing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah forbids mixing dregs of one wine with a different wine, but he may mix in dregs of the same wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Reuven gently poured wine to Shimon (so the dregs stayed in Reuven's Kli) - Reuven may not mix in dregs of a different wine, but he may mix in its own dregs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If water was mixed into wine, one may not sell it in a store without informing the buyer...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>They brought wine from a store to Rava. He mixed it and tasted it. It was not good. He returned it to the store.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> One may not sell mixed wine to a merchant, even if he informs him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> I put in so much water that any buyer will know that it was mixed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should be concerned lest the store owner add pure (undiluted) wine, so it will not be recognized!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If the store owner himself will mix the wine, he could add water to pure wine. He need not buy mixed wine to swindle (so we are not responsible).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In a place where people dilute wine with water, this is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One mixes according to the local custom, a half, third or quarter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This refers to at the time of pressing grapes.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WAYS TO ATTRACT BUYERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> A grocer may not give treats to children, for this accustoms them to patronize him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim permit this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah forbids selling for less than the standard price;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, he should be blessed for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Aba Sha'ul says, one who sells beans may not remove the cut beans;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Chachamim permit this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim agree that he may not remove the cut beans only on top, for that is deception.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>One may not be Mefarches (this will be explained) people, animals or Kelim (for sale).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why do Chachamim permit giving nuts?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The other grocers can do the same if they want.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah forbids selling for less than the standard price. Chachamim say, he should be blessed for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim permit this?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This will encourage others to sell cheaply, and the price will decline.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Aba Sha'ul says, one may not remove the cut beans. Chachamim permit this...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom do Chachamim hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like R. Acha;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Acha):</span> Anything that the buyer can see is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MAKING THE MERCHADISE ATTRACTIVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not be Mefarches people, animals or Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not be Mesharbet animals or inflate intestines (of a slaughtered animal) nor soak the meat in water (to make it appear fatty).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Mesharbet mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Bavel):</span> It is to give to them bran water to drink (to inflate the intestines and make the hair stand up).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ze'iri):</span> It is to comb with a thick comb.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Shmuel permitted putting silk fringes on a cloak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Yehudah permitted to starch clothing with colorful designs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rabah permitted stretching hemp garments (to show off the fine threads).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rava permitted putting designs on arrows;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav Papa bar Shmuel permitted putting designs on baskets.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> One may not be Mefarches people, animals or Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is forbidden only for old Kelim, for it makes them look new.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Mefarches mean with respect to people?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like the case of an old Kena'ani slave who dyed his (white) hair and beard black, and asked Rava to buy him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> A Mishnah says 'the poor should be in your household.' (It is better to pay a poor Yisrael to serve me.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Papa bar Shmuel bought him. One day, when he told the slave to serve him, the slave showed him that he was older than Rav Papa's father;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Papa applied to himself "Tzadik mi'Tzarah Nechelatz va'Yavo Rasha Tachtav" - the Tzadik (Rava) was saved from trouble, the evil one (myself) gets the evil in his place.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK EIZEHU NESHECH</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>NESHECH AND TARBIS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What is Neshech (biting, making the borrower pay more than he received), and what is Tarbis (increase (of the lender's money))?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Neshech is lending four Dinarim to get back five, or two Sa'im of wheat to get back three;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Tarbis is increasing Peros (like the coming case);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven bought a Kor of wheat for 25 Dinarim, which was the going rate. The price rose to 30 Dinarim, and he asked for his wheat, in order to sell it and buy wine. The seller did not have wheat; he promised to give Reuven 30 Dinarim worth of wine, and now he has no wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The Tana did not give examples of Tarbis mid'Oraisa (through a loan), only Tarbis mid'Rabanan (through a sale). This implies that mid'Oraisa, Neshech and Tarbis are the same!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah wrote them regarding different matters, so they must be different! Neshech is written regarding money, and Tarbis regarding food!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> You cannot find either without the other!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can find Neshech without Tarbis. He lent 100 (Perutos) on condition to get back 120. At the time of the loan, 100 Perutos was a Danka (a sixth; Rashi - of a Dinar; Ra'avad - of a Kor of grain), at the time of the payment, a Danka was 120 Perutos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The borrower pays more (Perutos), the lender does not gain (Rashi - he received back the same Danka he lent; Ran - we are thinking that Neshech depends on the time he lends him, Tarbis depends on the time of payment).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (Ran - no, Neshech and Tarbis both depend on the same time.) If it depends on the beginning (he stipulated to return 120 for 100), this is Neshech and Tarbis. If it depends on the end, (a Danka was given, a Danka was returned) there is neither Neshech nor Tarbis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can find Tarbis without Neshech. He lent 100 on condition to get back 100. At the time of the loan, 100 was a Danka (a sixth, of a Dinar or Kor), at the time of the payment, 100 was a fifth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If it depends on the beginning, this is neither Neshech nor Tarbis. If it depends on the end, there is both Neshech and Tarbis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Really, you cannot find one without the other. The Torah wrote them separately to forbid Ribis with a second Lav.</p>
