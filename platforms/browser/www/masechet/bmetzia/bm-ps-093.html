<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES A WORKER OWN WHAT HE EATS? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We can establish the Mishnah to discuss one who does not feed them only according to the opinion that a master cannot force his slave to work for him without feeding him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to the opinion that one can force his slave to work for him without feeding him, even if he does not feed him, he owns his wages!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Rather, both the Mishnah and the Beraisa (hold that a worker owns what he eats, and) discuss  one who does not feed them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah holds that a master cannot force his slave to work for him without feeding him. The Beraisa holds that he can.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yochanan holds that a master can force his slave to work for him without feeding him. Why does he rule like the Beraisa against the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #3:</span> Rather, both the Mishnah and the Beraisa hold that the Torah allows workers to eat. One cannot stipulate that minors may not eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that Shimon can stipulate that his minor child and slaves will not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, he will feed them much beforehand so they (presumably) will not eat while working.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, why does the Beraisa forbid this regarding his animals? (A Beraisa (90b) permits putting straw in front of his animal beforehand so it will not eat much while working!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rather, like we said above, the Mishnah holds that the Torah allows workers to eat, and the Beraisa holds that a worker owns what he eats.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shimon may stipulate with his employer to receive extra wages in place of eating; he may also stipulate on behalf of his wife and adult children and slaves, because they have intelligence;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may not stipulate on behalf of his minor children or slaves or his animals, because they lack intelligence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If Reuven hired Shimon to work with fourth year Peros, Shimon may not eat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven did not tell him that he will work with fourth-year Peros, Reuven must redeem what Shimon wants to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>If Shimon was hired to repress rings of figs that came apart or reseal barrels that were opened, he does not eat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven did not tell him that he will work with such Peros, Reuven must tithe them and allow Shimon to eat.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DO <i>SHOMRIM</i> EAT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Torah does not entitle Shomrei (people who guard) Peros to eat, but they may eat because that is the custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> The Mishnah discusses Shomrim of gardens and orchards (attached Peros), but Shomrim of winepresses or stacks of grain eat mid'Oraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav holds that guarding is like doing an action.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah discusses Shomrim of winepresses or stacks of grain, but Shomrim of gardens and orchards do not eat, not mid'Oraisa nor due to custom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel holds that guarding is not like doing an action.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> The one who guards the red heifer (after it was slaughtered) and his clothes become Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If guarding is not like doing an action, why is he Tamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is a decree, lest he move one of its limbs (which would make him Tamei mid'Oraisa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana - Beraisa):</span> One who guards patches of gourds of four or five people should not eat his fill from one, rather he eats from each.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Shmuel, one who guards attached Peros may not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> The case is, the gourds are detached.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, they are Kavu'a for Ma'aser (so a worker may not eat)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The flower did not yet fall off the top (they are not yet Kavu'a).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Shmuel - Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> The Torah allows the following to eat: one working with finished food attached to the ground, or any detached food...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Some workers do not eat mid'Oraisa, rather due to custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa says 'the following may not eat... What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They may not eat mid'Oraisa, rather due to custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Reisha taught this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they may not eat mid'Oraisa, nor due to custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This refers to people who work with attached Peros before it is finished. All the more so, Shomrim may not eat!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE <i>SHOMRIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are four kinds of Shomrim: a Shomer Chinam, a borrower, a Shomer Sachar, and a renter:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Shomer Chinam swears and is exempt for paying for any loss (that the Torah mentions regarding the other Shomrim); a borrower pays for any loss;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Shomer Sachar or renter swears if it was broken, taken captive or died, and pays if it was stolen or lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah 'there are four Shomrim'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman citing Rabah bar Avuha):</span> It is R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Does anyone argue that there are four Shomrim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Clarification: (Rav Nachman):</span> R. Meir is the Tana who says that a renter has the law of a Shomer Sachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir holds just the contrary!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A renter pays like a Shomer Chinam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, he pays like a Shomer Sachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah bar Avuha switches the opinions in the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since a renter is like a Shomer Sachar, there are only three Shomrim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> There are four Shomrim; they have three different laws of liability.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE LIABILITY OF <i>SHOMRIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A shepherd was grazing animals on the bank of the river. One fell into the water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> He is exempt. What could he have done? He guarded normally!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">93b----------------------------------------93b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, if he went to the city when people normally do, is he also exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If he slept a bit when people normally sleep, is he exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> A Shomer Sachar is exempt for Onsim such as "va'Tipol Sheva... Hiku Lefi Charev (an army attacked)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> That refers to guards of the city. They must guard better.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> A Shomer Sachar must guard to the point of "va'Yom Achalani Chorev v'Kerach ba'Laylah"- to guard day and night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> That also refers to guards of the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yakov (who said "Achalani. . ." ) was not a guard of the city!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He told Lavan that he guarded extra well, like a guard of the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If a shepherd was grazing the flock, and he left it and went to the city, and a wolf or lion came and killed some of the flock, we do not say that had he stayed he (surely) would have saved. Rather, we estimate;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he could have saved, he is liable. If not, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He went to the city when people normally do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> No, he went to the city when people normally do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, why is he exempt? The beginning was negligence, and the end was Ones. He is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> He went to the city because he heard a lion coming.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, what could he have done?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> He should have gathered shepherds with sticks to fend it off.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, why does the Beraisa discuss a (shepherd, who is a) Shomer Sachar? You obligate even a Shomer Chinam if he could have gathered shepherds with sticks to fend it off!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> If a Shomer Chinam cannot gather shepherds with sticks for free, he is exempt. A Shomer Sachar must hire people.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> How much should he pay?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> He should pay up to the value of the animals that he is guarding.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> A Shomer Sachar is exempt for Ones. Why must he pay to avoid Ones?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The owner reimburses him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> What does the owner gain if he must pay their value?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> His animals are used to his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> He saves the toil of buying new animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda and Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> A Shomer Sachar must guard better than usual. He is paid for this! (They argue with Rabah (above (b), who exempts one who guarded normally.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Bar Ada Savola'ah was taking animals across a bridge. One pushed another over into the water. Rav Papa ruled that he must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Bar Ada:</span> What should I have done?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> You should have led them single file.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Many have tried to exempt themselves according to Rabah. No one succeeded. (The Halachah does not follow Rabah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Aibo deposited flax with Bei Runya. It was stolen. The thief was found; he was a known armed robber. Rav Nachman obligated the Shomer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Nachman argues with Rav Huna bar Avin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Avin):</span> If it was stolen through Ones and the thief was later found, a Shomer Chinam may swear, or pay and claim the money from the thief. A Shomer Sachar may not swear. He must pay and claim the money from the thief.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Rav Nachman obligated him because there were (police) officers there.  Had he screamed, they would have come.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHAT IS <i>ONES</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One wolf is not Ones. Two wolves are Ones;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, when wolves are rampant, even one wolf is Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Two dogs are not Ones;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Yadu'a ha'Bavli says, from one direction it is not Ones. From two directions it is Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A robber is Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A lion, bear, leopard, Bardelas (hyena) or snake is Ones;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if it came here. If a Shomer took the deposit to a place where these animals are found, it is not Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If it died normally, this is Ones. If he starved it and it died, it is not Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If it went up a mountain and fell, it is Ones. If he brought it up a mountain and it fell, it is not Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> One wolf is Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The Beraisa is R. Yehudah. It discusses when wolves are rampant.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A robber is Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this Ones? The Shomer can fend off the robber!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is an armed robber considered Ones if the Shomer is also armed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that the Shomer can fend off the robber?</p>
