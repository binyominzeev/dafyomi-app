<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RETURNING THE FULL VALUE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Tarfon):</span> The finder may use the money...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They argue only if the finder used the money. If not, all agree that if it was lost, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes Rav Yosef!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> One who guards an Aveidah is a Shomer Chinam (one guarding a deposit for free);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> He is a Shomer Sachar (a paid Shomer, who is liable if it is lost or stolen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> All agree that if the money is stolen or lost, he is liable. They argue about Onsim (loss beyond the Shomer's control).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Tarfon says that Chachamim permit him to use the money, so he is a borrower, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says that Chachamim forbid him to use the money, he is not a borrower, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does R. Akiva say 'therefore'? (If he never used the money, obviously he is exempt!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not difficult for Rabah, who says that they argue about when the money is stolen or lost. One might have thought that one who guards an Aveidah is considered a Shomer Sachar. R. Akiva teaches that this is not so. He may not use the money, therefore he is like a Shomer Chinam, and he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if all agree that if the money is stolen or lost, he is liable, and they argue about Onsim, it would suffice for R. Akiva to say that he may not use the money, and clearly he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since R. Tarfon said 'therefore', R. Akiva also said it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Tarfon say 'therefore'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because Chachamim permit him to use the money, it is as if he used it, so he is liable (like a borrower).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that the money was lost!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Rabah taught (elsewhere, that it was lost through Ones).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> They were stolen by armed robbers. It was lost, i.e. the ship sank.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Tarfon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rachbah was holding orphans' money. He asked Rav Yosef whether he may use it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Rav Yehudah said that the Halachah follows R. Tarfon. Similarly, you may use it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> R. Chelbo added that is only when the finder sold the Aveidah, since he exerted himself, but not when he found money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Holding orphans' money is like finding money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Rav Yosef agreed, and forbade Rachbah to use it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW WE CARE FOR <i>AVEIDOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one found Sefarim (written on parchment, wrapped around poles), he should read in them once every 30 days. If he does not know how to read, he rolls them from beginning to end;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may not learn in it something he has not learned before (lest he spend a long time in one place), nor may two people read together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one found a garment, he shakes it once every 30 days and spreads it out for its upkeep, but not for his own honor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one found silver or copper Kelim, he uses them for their upkeep, but may not wear them out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one found gold or glass Kelim, he should leave them until Eliyahu comes and not touch them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If he finds a bag, box or anything that usually he would not carry (it is below his dignity), he leaves it there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> If one found Tefilin in the market, he estimates their value and may wear them immediately (on condition that if the owner will come and give a sign, he will give their value to him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> If one found Sefarim, he should read in them once every 30 days. If he does not how to read, he should roll them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah does not say to estimate them and take them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Tefilin are readily available to buy (the owner is happy to get their value). It is not easy to buy Sefarim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TAKING CARE OF A <i>SEFER</i> <i>TORAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven borrowed Shimon's Sefer Torah, he may not lend it to Levi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He opens it and reads in it, but may not learn in it something for the first time, nor may another person read with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Similarly, if Shimon deposited his Sefer Torah with Reuven, Reuven rolls it every 12 months, opens it and reads in it. If he opened it for his own needs, he may not read in it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Sumchus says, one rolls a new Sefer Torah every 30 days. One rolls an old one every 12 months;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, one rolls a new or old Sefer Torah every 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Reuven borrowed Shimon's Sefer Torah, he may not lend it to Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was this taught about a Sefer Torah? It applies to any borrowed object!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> A Mishnah teaches that a borrower may not lend to another person, and a renter may not rent to another!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that a Sefer Torah is different, for one is happy that people do a Mitzvah with his property. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Beraisa teach 'he opens it and reads in it'? This is obvious. He borrowed it to do so!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is the Seifa, he may not learn in it something for the first time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Similarly, if Shimon deposited his Sefer Torah with Reuven, Reuven rolls it every 12 months, opens it and read in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Why may he use it for himself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Seifa):</span> If he opened it for his own needs, he may not read in it.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Reisha permits him to read in it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> If when he is rolling it, he opens it and reads in it, this is permitted. If he opened it for himself, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Sumchus):</span> One rolls a new Sefer Torah every 30 days. One rolls an old one every 12 months;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, both are rolled every 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov says just like the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> The text should say that R. Eliezer says that both are rolled every 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may not learn in it something he has not learned before, nor should two people read together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> He may not read a Parshah in it and repeat it, nor read a Parshah and translate it, nor open it exposing more than three parchments, nor should three people read in one Sefer at a time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Two people may read together!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Two people may read in one Parshah, but not in two Parshiyos (Rashi; Rambam - just the opposite).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PRACTICAL ADVICE OF R. YOCHANAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one found a garment should shake it once every 30 days...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Shaking it out is good for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan said that shaking out a garment every day wears out clothing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Shaking it out once in 30 days is good for it. Shaking it out every day harms it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> When one person shakes it out, this is good for it. When two people shake it out, this harms it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Shaking it out by hand is good for it. Shaking it using a stick harms it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Shaking out a woolen garment harms it. Shaking out a linen garment is good for it (Rashi; Rambam - just the opposite).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Drinking lukewarm water is more harmful than water affected by witchcraft.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only in a metal Kli. In earthenware, there is no problem.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even in a metal Kli, if the water was boiled, there is no problem.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If herbs or spices were put in the water, there is no problem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The following deplete a person's wealth: wearing linen garments, using glass Kelim, and leaving hired workers unattended.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Wearing linen garments refers to Roman linen (it is expensive, and wears out quickly).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Using glass Kelim refers to 'white glass' (a very rare and precious crystal);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Leaving hired workers unattended refers to cases like plowers (they can ruin the field and the cattle).</p>
