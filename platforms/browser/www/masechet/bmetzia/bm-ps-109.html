<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>COMPENSATION FOR WHAT A DEVELOPER LEAVES BEHIND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven rented a field for a small period of time, he may not plant flax, and he may not cut branches of sycamore trees;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he rented it for seven years, he may plant flax and cut branches of sycamore trees the first year (since the loss will not be felt in the land and the tree when the land goes back).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Abaye):</span> He may not cut branches of sycamore trees, but he is compensated for their increased value (when he leaves).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He is not even compensated for their increased value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven rented a field, when it is time for him to leave, we estimate for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We estimate the increased value of the sycamore trees!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, we estimate the value of the vegetables and beets.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why estimate them? He may uproot them and take them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They will not last until the market day (when one gets the proper price for them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven rented a field and Shemitah came, we estimate for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Shemitah does not force him to leave the land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Beraisa):</span> Rather, if Yovel came, we estimate for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Yovel does not apply to rental. The Torah only forbids (and reverts) a permanent sale - "li'Tzmisus"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Beraisa):</span> Rather, if Reuven bought a field and Yovel came, we estimate for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps here also, we estimate the value of the vegetables and beets!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> In Yovel, vegetables and beets (and all Peros) are Hefker!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, we estimate the increased value of the sycamore trees!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye on behalf of Rava):</span> Yovel is different, for the Torah said "v'Yotza Mimkar Bayis" - the sale goes back, but the improvements do not go back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn from Yovel to a renter!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When one buys land, even though it goes back in Yovel, he is not like a renter . He is a full buyer, just Hash-m uproots his ownership in Yovel (and returns it to the seller).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Rav Papa rented a land to plant fodder; trees sprouted on it. When he left, he asked for the increased value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi:</span> If one rents a date tree to eat its fruit, and it got thicker, does he get the improvement?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> That is different. There, he did not rent it for the wood. I rented the field for whatever will grow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Papa holds like Abaye.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He can hold like Rava. Rava said that he gets no improvements only when he did not lose. Here, Rav Papa lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> His loss was a small area in which he could have grown fodder . That is all he is entitled to!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he could have grown saffron (which is very dear).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> You admit that you did not intend for lasting improvements, therefore you are only entitled to the value of wood (not the value of growing trees).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Rav Bibi bar Abaye rented a field; he raised the borders, and sorb trees sprouted in it. When he left, he asked for the improvements.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papi:</span> No. Even Rav Papa only demanded improvements because he suffered a loss. You suffered no loss from these!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN A SHARECROPPER LEAVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Yosef had a permanent planter (a sharecropper who did all the work in the field, starting with plating). He died, leaving five sons-in-law. Rav Yosef did not want them to continue for their father-in-law, lest each rely on the others, and the field would not be properly cared for.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I offer you the improvements on the field. If you refuse, you will get (letter of the law, i.e.) nothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a planter dies, the owner may expel his heirs without giving the improvements.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is wrong. (They are entitled to improvements.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a planter said 'if I cause a loss, I will leave' and he caused a loss, he does not get the improvements;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> He gets the improvements.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Kahana admits that if he said 'if I cause a loss, I will leave without improvements', he gets no improvements.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is Asmachta (an exaggerated promise). It is not binding. (He gets the improvements.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If he said 'if I will leave it fallow and not work it, I will pay what it would have produced' (this is binding).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, he pays for the loss he caused;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here also, we deduct the loss he caused, and he gets the balance of the improvements.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Runya was Ravina's planter. He caused a loss, and Ravina fired him. Runya complained to Rava, who defended Ravina.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Runya:</span> He did not warn me (that he would fire me if I cause a loss)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> He need not warn you!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The following may be fired (for negligence) without warning: one who teaches children, a planter, a slaughterer, a bloodletter, and the town scribe (Rashi - to write Sifrei Torah; Tosfos - to write documents);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">109b----------------------------------------109b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The general rule is, in any trade in which a mistake cannot be corrected, it is as if the worker was warned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CHANGES OF CONTRACT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A planter asked for the improvements (after he planted), because he wanted to go to Eretz Yisrael. Rav Papa bar Shmuel ruled that the owner must give them to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> The land also caused the increased value!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa bar Shmuel:</span> Indeed, I meant that he shares the improvements.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> The agreement was that the owner gets half. He will now need to hire a sharecropper (to finish the work for a planted field)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa bar Shmuel:</span> Indeed, I meant that he gets a quarter of the improvements.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Rav Papa meant a quarter of the owner's share, i.e. a sixth. (The owner will get two thirds, and the sharecropper who will finish gets a third.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Minyomi brei d'Rav Nechumi):</span> In a place where a planter gets half the crop and a sharecropper (who works a planted field) gets a third, a planter who leaves after planting gets a share of the improvements (i.e. a sixth), in order that the owner does not lose. (After the owner pays a sixth, he will be left with half, like he normally received.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the planter would get a quarter of the Peros, the owner would lose!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> Why can't the planter say 'give (a quarter) from your (three quarters) share to hire a sharecropper to finish working your share, and I will do with my share (a quarter) as I want'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Retraction (Rav Ashi):</span> Indeed, he can say so. (Rav Papa meant that he gets a quarter of the Peros.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Chananel) Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He cannot say this because one cannot find a sharecropper for less than a third. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Minyomi brei d'Rav Nechumi):</span> In a place where a planter gets half the crop and a sharecropper gets a third, a planter who leaves after planting gets a share of the improvements in order that the owner does not lose.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (Rav Minyomi brei d'Rav Nechumi):</span> A planter gets half of an old vine (just like he gets half the Peros), for this is normal. If a river flooded the field (and the trees will not produce fruits for a long time), the planter gets half the wood (like the law of a planter who leaves early).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Chananel - (Rav Minyomi brei d'Rav Nechumi):</span> If a planter uproots old vines and plants new ones, he gets half the Peros (for this is much work). If a river flooded the field (and uprooted the trees) and he plants new ones, he gets a quarter of the Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A case occurred in which Reuven gave his orchard as collateral for a loan for ten years (they deducted its rental value for each year from the loan). After five years, the trees stopped producing, for they were old.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> The wood is considered like Peros. The lender gets it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> The wood is considered like principal. They buy land with it, and the lender eats the Peros (for the remaining five years, after which Reuven keeps it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> (In Mashkanta of Sura, after a certain time, the tree goes back for free.) If the tree dried (and no longer gives fruit) or was cut, neither the lender or borrower may use it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They should sell it and buy land. The lender eats the Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In Yovel, the land will revert to the one who sold it. The principal is consumed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case when it dries is like when it is cut. Just like (presumably) it was cut in the proper time (when it ceased to bear fruit), also it dried in the proper (i.e. expected) time, and it says that they buy land with it and the lender eats the Peros!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This shows that the wood is principal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. The case when it is cut is like when it dries. Just like 'dried' connotes before the proper time (it does not say 'it grew old'), also it was cut before the proper time.</p>
