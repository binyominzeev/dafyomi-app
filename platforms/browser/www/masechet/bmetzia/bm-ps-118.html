<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MUST ONE ACCEPT A CHANGE IN WAGES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> If Levi hired Yehudah to work with him collecting straw, he cannot insist that Yehudah take straw for wages;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Yehudah agreed, Levi cannot retract and give his wages and keep all his straw.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How much of the garden must sink (for the law of the Mishnah to apply)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The majority must sink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> Four Tefachim must sink.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav requires the majority, but not just four Tefachim, for one can plant part of his garden at a lower level;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel holds that four Tefachim suffice, for one cannot plant part of his garden at a lower level.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They needed to argue here and above (regarding an Aliyah that sunk).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Had they argued only above, one might have thought that only regarding a dwelling Shmuel says that one cannot live at two levels, but one can manage with such a garden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Had they argued only here, one might have thought that Rav admits that one cannot live in a dwelling at two levels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they gave him time...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much time do we give him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> We give 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven's wall...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Later the Mishnah mentions Shimon's expenditures, implying that he cleared the rocks away.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he not cleared them away, he did not acquire them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Why doesn't his field acquire for him?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> One's Chatzer acquires for him without his knowledge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only when the person wants to acquire. Here, Shimon did not want the rocks.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WITH WHAT MAY ONE PAY A WORKER?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Levi hired Yehudah to work with him collecting straw...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We needed to teach this and the previous cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had we taught only about a wall, one might have thought that there Shimon need not take the rocks, because Reuven does not owe him, but an employer can pay his worker with anything he wants.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had we taught only about wages, one might have thought that there Levi cannot retract after Yehudah agrees, for Levi owes him, but regarding rocks, Reuven can retract even after Shimon agrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Levi cannot insist that Yehudah take straw for wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Levi can insist.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> If Yehudah worked for Levi, Levi cannot insist. If Levi asked Yehudah to work for Shimon, Levi can insist.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah):</span> When Yehudah worked for Levi, Levi cannot insist, because he must pay him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also when Levi asked Yehudah to work for Shimon, Levi must pay him!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Yosef hired David to work on Yosef's property, and set him to work on what is really Moshe's property, Yosef pays David, and can demand that Moshe pay him the benefit he received.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> Rather, if Yehudah worked for Levi, Levi cannot insist. If Yehudah worked with Hefker property, Levi can insist.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava - Beraisa):</span> A worker keeps what he finds. This is only if the employer said 'weed (or another particular task) with me today';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'work for me today', the employer gets it. (Therefore, even if Yehudah worked with Hefker, Levi acquired it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman):</span> In both cases, Yehudah worked with Hefker;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Yehudah picked it up, Levi acquired it, he cannot insist;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Yehudah only watched it, it is still Hefker, Levi can insist.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not or not looking at Hefker acquires it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> People guarding Sefichim (produce that grows by itself) in Shemitah (needed for communal Korbanos) are paid from Terumas ha'Lishkah (half-Shekalim used to buy the Korbanos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, one who wants to guard for free volunteers his time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> According to you, the Korban does not come from the Tzibur (rather from the individual who guarded it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim hold that looking at Hefker acquires it. If the Shomer is not paid, the produce is his;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yosi holds that looking at Hefker does not acquire it. It is not acquired until (a Shali'ach of) the Tzibur takes it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim told R. Yosi, if we do like you say, we hold that the Korban would belong to the watcher!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rejection (Rava):</span> No, all hold that looking at Hefker acquires it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about whether or not or not we rely on the Shomer to properly give the produce to the Tzibur (perhaps he wants to retain ownership so the Korban will be his);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say that the Shomer watcher must be paid, we are concerned lest he not give it properly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi says that the Shomer is not paid, we rely on him to give it properly.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim told R. Yosi, if done as you say, we are concerned that the Korban would belong to the Shomer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rejection (Rava):</span> All hold that looking at Hefker does not acquire it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about whether or not or not we are concerned that if we do not pay the Shomer (to publicize that he is guarding for Hekdesh), others will forcibly take the produce themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that it was enacted to pay the Shomer four Zuz in order that others will not forcibly take the produce;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi holds that no such enactment was made.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">118b----------------------------------------118b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim told R. Yosi, if we do like you say, four Zuz of Terumas ha'Lishkah really belongs to the Shomer (he waived his right to take it). Korbanos bought with those four Zuz belong to the Shomer, not to the Tzibur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> R. Yochanan holds like Version #2.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DAMAGE TO THE <i>RESHUS</i> <i>HA'RABIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who takes dung (for fertilizer) to the Reshus ha'Rabim may not leave it there (he must immediately take it to his field or garden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may not soak mud or form bricks and leave them to dry in the Reshus ha'Rabim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may knead mud to immediately put it in the building, but not to make bricks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one builds in the Reshus ha'Rabim, one person brings the rocks, and they must immediately be built into the building;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If someone is hurt, the builder must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, one may prepare what he will need 30 days before he builds, and he is exempt for resulting damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is not like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> When people normally put out dung, one may put dung in the Reshus ha'Rabim for 30 days so that people and animals will trample on it. Yehoshua made this a condition for inheriting Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is even like R. Yehudah. R. Yehudah admits that he is liable if it damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> (If a grocer left Ner Chanukah burning outside his shop, and this set fire to a load of flax on a passing camel, and the camel walked around, and set the whole building on fire,) the grocer is exempt, because he had permission to leave the lights burning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Because he had permission of Beis Din, he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, because it is a Mitzvah he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The following Beraisa shows that our Mishnah is not R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Everyone who may ruin the Reshus ha'Rabim, if he damages, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Indeed, our Mishnah is not R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> All the following hold that if one acted with permission, and he damaged, he is exempt: R. Yehudah (above), R. Shimon ben Gamliel and R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> One may prepare what he will need 30 days before he builds, and he is exempt for resulting damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not set up a Tanur (oven) in his house unless there are four Amos above it. One may not set up a Tanur in an Aliyah unless there are three Tefachim of plaster below it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>For a Kirah (an oven that does not get as hot), one Tefach suffices.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the oven caused damage, he must pay for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon says, if he kept the proper distance, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a rock quarrier gave over the rocks to one who smoothes them, the smoother is liable (for any damage that results);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the rocks were passed on to a donkey-driver (to transport them), to one who carries them himself, to the builder, to the Adrichal (one who straightens out the rocks in the building), at any time, the last one who received them is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a rock fell off the row being built - since its momentum did not come from the Adrichal, all share the liability.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> The last one is liable, and all previous ones are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If they are paid wages (based on how long they work for), only the last is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they are Kablanim (they are hired to complete the job), all are responsible.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven owns a garden, and Shimon owns an adjacent garden on a mound, and plants growing on the side of the mound are over Reuven's garden, these plants belong to Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, they belong to Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> If Shimon would take his dirt, they would not grow!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> If Reuven would fill his airspace with dirt, they would not grow!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> Since either could stop them from growing, they belong to the one from whose property they grow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon says, whatever Shimon can reach (from his property), he takes. The rest belongs to Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava):</span> All agree that the roots belong to Shimon. They argue only about the foliage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir treats the foliage the same as the roots;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah does not treat the foliage the same as the roots.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Levi owned a tree in Yehudah's land, what grows out of the stump or roots belongs to Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah says, what grows out of the stump belongs to Levi. What grows out of the roots belongs to Yehudah.</p>
