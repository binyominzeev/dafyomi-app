<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA METZIA 112-116 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to Rav Weiner -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TAKING FOR A SECURITY A <i>KLI</i> USED WITH FOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yehudah - Beraisa #1):</span> If one takes for a security a pair of scissors or a yoke made of two parts (to harness cows), he is lashed twice, once for each part; (Tosfos - this is like Rav Yehudah, for Rav Huna would obligate three times; Rashi - the support requires the next Beraisa as well, which shows that the two lashes here are for Rechayim and Rechev, hence there are no lashes for "Ki Nefesh Hu Chovel".)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he only takes one blade of the scissors or one part of the yoke, he is lashed only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If one takes for a security a pair of scissors or a two-part yoke, one might have thought that he is lashed only once. Therefore, it says "Lo Yachavol Rechayim va'Rachev";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Rechayim and Rechev are two Kelim that do one task, and one is liable for each by itself, also any two Kelim that do one task, one is liable for each by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A case arose in which Reuven took a security from Shimon. It was a knife that butchers use to chop meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Since it is used for food, you must return it. You can claim your loan in Beis Din (if you have witnesses, or if Shimon will admit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Since witnesses did not see Reuven take it, he need not return it until Shimon pays.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Abaye argue with Rava? This should be like the following case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some goats ate peeled barley in Neharda'a. The owner of the barley seized the goats, and was claiming a large loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel's father):</span> He can claim up to the goats' value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Goats are not normally lent or rented, therefore the one who seized them has a Migo. He could have said that he bought them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A knife is normally lent or rented. Reuven has no Migo, for he would not be believed to say that he bought it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Avin):</span> If an item is normally lent or rented, and Ploni holds it and claims that he bought it (if we know that it belonged to someone else), he is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rava argue with this?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava took shearing scissors and a Sefer of Agadic teachings from orphans, because these are normally lent and rented!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A chopping knife can get blunted, so people do not normally lend or rent it.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DIVIDING THE BUILDING MATERIALS OF A FALLEN HOUSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven owned a house and Shimon owned its upper story and it fell, they divide the wood, rocks and dirt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we estimate that the upper rocks would have broken, Reuven gets the whole rocks and Shimon takes an equal amount of broken ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If either recognizes some of his rocks, he takes them, and the other takes an equal amount of other ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> 'We estimate' implies that we can tell whether the bottom collapsed, or the attic broke;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why do they divide equally in the Reisha? The one whose dwelling broke should get the broken rocks!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It fell at night, and no one saw how it fell.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The next day we can determine how it fell!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the rocks were cleared away.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We can ask the people who cleared them away!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, we do not know them, and they left.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whoever's premises the rocks are in, he is Muchzak. The other cannot take (whole rocks) from him without proof!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, the rocks are in their joint yard, or in the Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Even if the rocks are in the premises of one of them, partners freely lend their premises to each other (so the rocks are considered to be in the premises of both).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If either recognizes some of his rocks... (we shall call him Reuven).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Shimon claim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he admits, the law is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he argues, why does Reuven keep the whole ones?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he says that he does not know.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes Rav Nachman!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna and Rav Yehudah):</span> If Levi claims 100 from Yehudah, and Yehudah does not know whether he owes, he must pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Rav Nachman):</span> He is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the case is like Rav Nachman explained elsewhere;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The case is, Yehudah was obligated to swear to Levi. (Since Yehudah does not know, he cannot swear, he must pay).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here also, Shimon was obligated to swear!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case in which he was obligated to swear?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Yehudah admitted that he owed 50, but he did not know about the other 50. Since he cannot swear, he must pay. (Here also, Shimon admits that half the rocks are not his.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shimon takes an equal amount of other ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rava):</span> He takes an equal amount of broken rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he does not recognize his rocks, we assume that his are the broken ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Just the contrary! Since Reuven recognizes only some of his rocks, we assume that his other rocks are broken, and the rest of the whole rocks belong to Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Abaye):</span> Rather, Shimon takes an equal amount of whole rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what does Reuven gain by recognizing some of his rocks?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Some rocks are wider than others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The mud of some bricks is kneaded better than that of others.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE OBLIGATION TO REBUILD AN UPPER STORY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon was renting Reuven's Aliyah, and the floor fell in and Reuven does not want to fix it, Shimon may live in the house downstairs until Reuven fixes it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, Reuven must supply the ceiling, Shimon supplies the plaster.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How much of the floor must fall in (for the law of the Mishnah to apply)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It must be the majority.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> It must be four Tefachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav requires the majority. The law does not apply if only four Tefachim fell, for one can manage with part of his dwelling at a lower level.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel holds that four Tefachim suffices, for one cannot live if part of his dwelling is at a lower level.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the rental agreement?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he rented '<i>this</i> Aliyah', it is no longer intact (he has no right to demand another)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he rented '<i>an</i> Aliyah', Reuven may find another Aliyah for Shimon to live in! (Why is Shimon entitled to dwell in Reuven's house?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Reuven rented 'this Aliyah' to him, and said 'if it sinks, you may live in the house.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, what is the Chidush?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Reuven rented 'this Aliyah on top of this house.' These words give Shimon a 'lien' on the house to support his Aliyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ravin bar Rav Ada:</span> A case occurred in which Levi sold to Yehudah 'the vine draped over this peach tree'; and the tree was uprooted. R. Chiya ruled that Levi must supply a peach tree to support the vine for the life of the vine.</p>
