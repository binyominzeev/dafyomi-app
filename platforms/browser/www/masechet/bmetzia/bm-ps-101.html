<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A TREE DEPOSITED ON ANOTHER'S PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If a river flooded Levi's trees...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> The Mishnah discusses only if they were uprooted with their surrounding earth, and after three years;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Within three years, Levi gets all the olives. Even if Yehudah would have planted his own trees, he could not have benefited from the Peros for three years (they are Orlah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Yehudah can say, had I planted my own trees, I would have received all the Peros after three years. I agreed to keep your trees there and let you share the Peros after three years, only on condition that I share the Peros within three years!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> The Mishnah discusses only if they were uprooted with their surrounding earth, and <i>within</i> three years;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After three years, Yehudah gets all the olives. Had he planted his own trees, he would have received all the Peros after three years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Levi can say, had you planted your own trees, you would not have benefited for three years;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Now that you shared the olives with me within three years, I should share after three years!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yehudah can say, had I planted my own trees, they would have been small the first three years, and I could have planted beets and vegetables underneath them. (Your trees were big and I could not plant under them, therefore I shared the olives.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Levi cannot say 'I will take back my trees'. (He does get half the olives for three years, and is then paid the value of trees (for replanting)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't he take back his trees?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> This is an enactment for the settlement of Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ENACTMENTS FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF <i>ERETZ</i> <i>YISRAEL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If Reuven is a sharecropper on his ancestors' field that (now) belongs to a Nochri, he must tithe even the half that he returns to the Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is 'his ancestors' field'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is Eretz Yisrael, which formerly belonged to Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah holds that a Nochri cannot acquire Eretz Yisrael to uproot (the Kedushah and) the obligation to separate Ma'aser from the Peros, and that a sharecropper (who gets a fixed portion of the produce) is like a Chocher (one who rents a field on condition to pay a fixed amount of Peros each year);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a Chocher must tithe and pay the Nochri whether or not the field produces, for he pays a debt, also a sharecropper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If Reuven is a sharecropper on his ancestors' field that now belongs to a Nochri extortionist, he must tithe even the Nochri's share.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why does the Beraisa discuss an extortionist? The same applies to any Nochri!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, R. Yehudah holds that a Nochri can acquire Eretz Yisrael to uproot Ma'aser, and a sharecropper is not like a Chocher. The field belonged to Reuven's father or grandfather;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The obligation to tithe is a fine on heirs of the original owners. Since the field is dear to them, they will work it anyway.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for the fine?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It encourages the heir to buy it back from the Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WORKING FOR ANOTHER'S BENEFIT WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Reuven planted Shimon's field without permission, he has the lower hand (he gets the improvement or his expenditures, whichever is smaller);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We estimate how much someone would pay to have such a field planted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> They do not argue. Rav discusses a field that is not normally planted, and Shmuel discusses a field that is normally planted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav did not say this explicitly. Rather it was inferred from the following case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yehudah planted Levi's field without permission. Rav said that he must estimate and pay. Levi said 'I did not want it planted.' Rav said that he must estimate and pay, but Yehudah has the lower hand. Levi refused.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Later, Rav saw Levi guarding the crops. Since he showed that he was happy that it was planted, he forced him to give Yehudah the upper hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If Reuven rebuilt Shimon's ruined house without permission he may take back his wood and rocks;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> He may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Beis Shamai say, he may take them back;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel say, he may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Does Rav Nachman rule like Beis Shamai?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, Rav Nachman rules like R. Shimon ben Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> He may take them back;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, Beis Shamai say that he may take them back, and Beis Hillel say that he may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is the Halachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yakov):</span> If he rebuilt a house, he may take back his wood and rocks. If he planted young trees in a field, he may not take them back.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">101b----------------------------------------101b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must he leave the trees?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is for the settlement of Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He already caused (a loss to Reuven,) weakening of the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about a field in Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>GIVING NOTICE BEFORE EVICTING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven rented a house to Shimon in winter, he cannot evict him from Sukos until Pesach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In summer, he cannot evict him for 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In big cities he cannot evict him for 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Regarding a store, even in small cities, he cannot evict him for 12 months (to enable the grocer to collect from people who bought on credit).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, one who rents a baker or dyer's store gets three years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Presumably, one cannot evict a tenant in winter because a person expects to rent one place for the entire winter. Likewise, a person expects to rent one place for the entire summer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One cannot evict a tenant in winter because it is hard to find housing in winter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reisha):</span> In big cities he cannot evict him for 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the 12 months expire in winter, he can evict him, even though it is hard to find housing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah tells how much warning one must give before evicting a tenant;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven rented a house to Shimon in winter, he cannot evict him from Sukos until Pesach without giving 30 days warning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> The 30 days and 12 months are the periods of warning before evicting;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the owner must warn the tenant, also the tenant must warn the owner before leaving so he can look for suitable tenants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> If he lived there one day in winter, he cannot be evicted from Sukos until Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (This implies that in summer he can be evicted immediately.) The Mishnah gives 30 days!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Asi means that if even one of the 30 days extends into winter, he cannot be evicted until Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>RIGHTS OF A LANDLORD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The owner may raise the rental.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> That is the ultimate eviction!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He may raise the rent if the cost of housing has increased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Obviously, if Reuven's house fell, he can tell Shimon to leave when the contract expires. Reuven need not give warning, because he did not know that he would need the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If Reuven sold, gave or bequeathed the house to Levi, Levi has no right to evict Shimon before Reuven could.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven needed the house to marry off his son (and the son will live there), if he could have warned the renter but he did not, he cannot evict him. If it was impossible to warn him, he may evict him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Reuven bought a boatload of wine; he had no place to put it. He asked Leah if she had a place for it, and she said 'no'. He was Mekadesh her; she gave him a place. He immediately wrote and sent her a Get; she hired workers to remove his wine, paying them from the wine itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> She (justifiably) treated him like he treated her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not only if her Chatzer is not normally rented. Rather, even if it is normally rented, she can say that she does not want to rent to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> One who rents a baker or dyer's store gets three years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This is because he extends much credit.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>WHAT THE LANDLORD MUST SUPPLY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven rented his house to Shimon, he must supply the door, bolt and lock, and everything that requires a craftsman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon supplies anything that does not require a craftsman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The dung belongs to Reuven (this will be explained). Shimon only gets (ashes) from the oven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven rented his house to Shimon, he must supply the doors, make windows (i.e. holes in the wall for air and light), strengthen the roof (if it corrodes), and fix any beams that break;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Shimon must make a ladder, a Ma'akeh (a wall around the roof to prevent people from falling), a gutter pipe, and plaster the roof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who must supply the Mezuzah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. Rav Mesharshiya taught that the one who lives in a house is obligated to affix a Mezuzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The question was, who must supply the place in which to put the Mezuzah (the word 'Mezuzah' means doorpost).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes - Mishnah):</span> Shimon supplies anything that does not require a craftsman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One can put the Mezuzah in a hollow reed and hang it from the doorpost. This does not require a craftsman!</p>
