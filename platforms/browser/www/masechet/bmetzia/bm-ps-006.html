<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF STEALING (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one suspected of stealing is suspected to swear falsely, why are the following three oaths given?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> One (who fully denies a claim) must swear Heses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya's Beraisa):</span> Both the grocer and the workers swear and collect from the employer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> (If a Shomer who guards for free says that the deposit was stolen,) he must make three oaths: that he was not negligent, that he did not take the deposit for his own use, and that it is not in his premises.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even if we suspect someone of stealing, we are not concerned lest he swear falsely.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 3:j, 5b - Abaye):</span> (In our Mishnah, even though each is Muchzak in half,) they swear because we are concerned lest one of them grabbed the Talis in order to collect an old debt (the Talis' owner forgot about it and denies it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If this is the concern (he really is entitled to collect), each should get half without an oath!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, we are concerned lest one grabbed it to collect a Safek old debt. (Since he himself is unsure, he should not collect.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we suspect that one grabbed another's property to collect mi'Safek (even though this could be theft), we should be concerned lest he swear mi'Safek (that he owns, i.e. is entitled to collect half)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> One will not swear if he is unsure, but he does not refrain from taking property (to collect his Safek debt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he later realizes his mistake, he can return the property. One cannot retract a false oath.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IF SOMEONE GRABBED THE GARMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> (In our Mishnah) if Reuven grabbed the garment in front of Beis Din, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Shimon kept quiet, he admits that it is Reuven's!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If Shimon protested, (this is not admission;) what else could he do?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he was silent, then protested.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Was his initial silence an admission?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, does his protest reveal that his initial silence was only because he felt no need to protest, since Beis Din sees what happened?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman - Beraisa):</span> The case is, both are holding it. If one holds it alone, ha'Motzi me'Chavero Alav ha'Re'ayah (the other must bring a proof to take it from him).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If we understand simply that one holds it, obviously, it is his (unless the other brings proof)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, (both were holding it, and) Reuven grabbed it in front of Beis Din (and Shimon was initially silent, then protested).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (and Answer #2 to Question 1):</span> No. Both were holding it, and we told them to split it. They left, and came back with Reuven holding it. Reuven says that Shimon admitted to him; Shimon says that he rented his half to Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon is not believed. He claims that Reuven is a thief. Surely he would not rent to him without witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (and Answer #3):</span> When they entered Beis Din, Reuven was holding the garment itself, and Shimon was holding onto the fringes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even Sumchus, who holds that when in doubt, we divide the money without an oath, admits that holding onto the fringes is insignificant.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MAKING DISPUTED PROPERTY <i>HEKDESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If you will say that if when Reuven grabs it in front of Beis Din, we take it back (and Shimon gets half), if Reuven was Makdish it (declared it Hekdesh), it (Shimon's half; some explain, the entire garment) is not Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If you will say that if when Reuven grabs it in front of Beis Din, he keeps it, if Reuven was Makdish it without grabbing it, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since a declaration to Hekdesh is like an acquisition to a person, this is like grabbing it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he did not grab it, it is not in his Reshus (jurisdiction), it does not become Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"If a man will make his house Hekdesh" - just like his house is in his Reshus, one can be Makdish only things in his Reshus. This excludes cases like this (a disputed garment).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A case occurred in which Reuven and Shimon were fighting over a bathhouse. Each said 'it is mine.' Reuven was Makdish it. R. Chananya, R. Oshaya and all the Chachamim stopped using it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Oshaya asked Rabah to ask Rav Chisda about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Hamnuna:</span> A Mishnah teaches the law!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there is a Safek Bechor (firstborn male) person or animal, whether Tahor or Tamei (there is a Mitzvah to redeem a Bechor donkey), ha'Motzi me'Chavero Alav ha'Re'ayah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not shear or work with a Safek Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If a Kohen took a Safek Bechor, we do not force him to return it, for ha'Motzi me'Chavero Alav ha'Re'ayah (perhaps it is truly a Bechor). Even if he did not take it, one may not shear or work it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rabah):</span> Perhaps we force a Kohen who took a Safek Bechor to return it. A Safek Bechor is forbidden because Kedushas Bechor comes automatically. (However, one can be Makdish a bathhouse only if it is in his Reshus.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>MA'ASER</i> OF ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rabah - R. Chananya - Beraisa):</span> Sefeikos (perhaps they are exempt  from Ma'aser, e.g. they belong to a Kohen) are tithed with other animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Kohen who took a Safek may keep it, how could the Yisrael make it Ma'aser? He exempts his obligation with the Kohen's property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> Perhaps a Kohen who took a Safek he must return it. The case is, there are only nine other animals. In any case, there is no problem:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Safek really belongs to the Yisrael, it can truly be Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it really belongs to the Kohen, the Yisrael has no obligation to take Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Abaye):</span> I erred. A Safek is not tithed:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an animal already counted (during tithing) jumped back into the pen and was mixed with the uncounted animals, they are all exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Sefeikos could be tithed, we would be able to tithe without any problem:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If 10 animals leave the pen and none of them were counted before, the 10th is truly Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If one of them was already counted, the 10th is not really Ma'aser, but all are exempted due to <i>Minyan ha'Ra'uy</i> (they were counted when there were 10 animals in the pen that needed to be tithed).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Minyan ha'Ra'uy exempts (even if Ma'aser is not taken, e.g. the tenth animal died before it was called Ma'aser).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rather, we must say that the Torah requires a definite tenth. A Safek (perhaps it was already counted) cannot be Ma'aser (even if really, it was not already counted);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Also a Safek (perhaps it is the Kohen's) cannot be Ma'aser (even if in truth it is the Yisrael's)!</p>
