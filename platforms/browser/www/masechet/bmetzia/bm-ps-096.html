<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN MUST HE BE WORKING FOR HIM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Im Ba'alav Imo Lo Yeshalem" - he is exempt if the owner was working for him at both times, or even at one of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Ba'alav Ein Imo Shalem Yeshalem" - he is liable if the owner was not working for him at even one of the times!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he was working for him only at the time of borrowing, he is exempt. If he was working only at the time of death, he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is the other way! If he was working for him only at the time of borrowing, he is liable. If he was working only at the time of death, he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Presumably, the time of borrowing is more important, since the animal comes to his jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> No, the time of breakage or death is more important, for that is what he pays for!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had he not borrowed, he would not be liable for the death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Had it not died, he would not be liable for borrowing!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is liable for feeding it from when he borrows it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> "When a man will borrow me'Im Re'ehu (<i>from</i> his neighbor, he will be liable)", but not when he borrows Im Re'ehu (with his neighbor, at the time of borrowing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why do we need the verses "Be'alav Ein Imo" and "Im Be'alav Imo"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If not for them, we would not have expounded "me'Im Re'ehu." We would have said that it is normal for a verse to speak this way.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN IS A BORROWER LIABLE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If Reuven borrowed an animal for bestiality, is this considered borrowing (Rashi - to be liable for Ones; Rambam - to get the exemption of b'Ba'alim, but liability for Ones comes for having used it, even if he is not a borrower)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps the Torah discusses only normal borrowing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, a borrower is one who gets free benefit, and here also he gets free benefit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he borrowed something to appear rich, is he like a borrower?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it depends on getting monetary benefit, he gets it (people will give him credit);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he must benefit from the object itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he borrowed an animal to use for less than the value of a Perutah, is he like a borrower?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it depends on (getting benefit from) something of worth, this is fulfilled;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps less than a Perutah is like getting no benefit?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If you will say that borrowing to use for less than a Perutah is not like borrowing, if he borrowed two animals to use for a Perutah, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The borrower gets a Perutah of benefit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since each borrowed animal does less than a Perutah of work, perhaps he is unlike a borrower!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Reuven borrowed from two partners, and one of them was working for him, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps the exemption is only if all the owners are working for him, and they are not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he is exempt for the half of the owner working for him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If two partners borrowed from Shimon, and he was working for one of them, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps the exemption is only if the owner is working for all the borrowers, and he is not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps the partner for whom the owner is working is exempt for his half?</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DOES A HUSBAND OWN HIS WIFE'S PROPERTY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Reuven borrowed a woman's animal and hired her husband, or if a woman borrowed an animal and her husband hired the owner, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is Kinyan Peros (a husband's owns the earnings of his wife's property) like Kinyan ha'Guf (owning the property itself)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'go work in place of me with my cow', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps the exemption is only when the owner himself works;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we say that one's Shali'ach is like himself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rav Avya):</span> R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish argue about the question about the husband. R. Yonason and R. Yoshiyah argue about the question about the Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If Reuven sold the rights to the Peros of his field to Shimon, Shimon brings Bikurim and recites the Parshah (in which he thanks Hash-m for "the land that You gave to me.") Kinyan Peros is like Kinyan ha'Guf ;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Shimon brings Bikurim but does not recite the Parshah. Kinyan Peros is not like Kinyan ha'Guf.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(R. Yochanan considers a husband to own his wife's property. Reish Lakish does not.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah) Suggestion:</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'annul any vows that my wife will take until I return from my trip' (and he did so), perhaps they are annulled !</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ishah Yekimenu v'Ishah Yeferenu" (only her husband can annul them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yonason says, a man's Shali'ach is like himself in all respects.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(R. Yonason says that one's Shali'ach is like himself regarding borrowing b'Ba'alim. R. Yoshiyah argues.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ilish):</span> If Reuven told his slave 'go work in place of me with my cow', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can ask according to R. Yonason (who says that a man's Shali'ach is like himself) and according to R. Yoshiyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Perhaps R. Yonason says that one's Shali'ach is like himself only when the Shali'ach himself is commanded about the matter, but a slave cannot be a lender or borrower (whatever he gets belongs to his master)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Perhaps R. Yoshiyah agrees that one's slave is like himself, because the slave's Yad (power of acquisition) is like his master's Yad!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Presumably, a man's slave is like himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> Is a man like a borrower of his wife's property, or a renter?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">96b----------------------------------------96b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> The question is pointless!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Whether he is a borrower or renter, he is exempt, for this is b'Ba'alim (she works for him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rami bar Chama asked about one who rented a cow from a woman, and later married her.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a husband is a borrower, borrowing b'Ba'alim uproots the rental;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If a husband is a renter, he continues to be a renter (and since it was not initially b'Ba'alim, he is liable).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If he is a borrower, we say that borrowing b'Ba'alim uproots the rental. Likewise,  if he is a renter, we should say that renting b'Ba'alim uproots rental not b'Ba'alim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rami bar Chama asked about a woman who rented a cow from Shimon and later married Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>He does not ask according to Chachamim (of R. Yosi, 35b).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(If Simchah rented Shimon's cow and lent it to Levi, and it died normally), Chachamim say that Simchah swears that it died normally, and Levi pays Simchah. Even if a husband is a borrower, since he would pay his wife, this is b'Ba'alim, so he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Rami bar Chama asks according to R. Yosi, who says that Levi pays Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since he is liable to pay Shimon (who is not working for Levi or his wife), this is clearly not b'Ba'alim. Rami asks if Levi is a renter or a borrower.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A husband is neither a renter or borrower, rather, a buyer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> (When a woman marries, her husband eats the Peros of her property. If she said that it should be Nichsei Melug, when she is widowed or divorced, she takes back her property without compensation for any increase or decrease in value.) In Usha, they enacted that if a married woman sold her Nichsei Melug and then died, her husband takes it back from the buyers. (We consider it as if he bought her property beforehand, from the time he married her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> (If a married woman inherited property, her husband acquires (the rights to eat the Peros from) it. If they did not know that it included Hekdesh, who transgressed Me'ilah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> The husband did not. He wants to acquire only permitted property!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She did not. She did not want him to acquire her (Rashi - forbidden) property!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Beis Din (Rashi - the greatest Chachamim in Yisrael at the time, to whom we attribute all Rabbinical enactments) did not. They made a husband like a buyer only of her permitted property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The husband will transgress Me'ilah when he spends the Hekdesh (like anyone who unknowingly spends Hekdesh money).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>BREAKAGE THROUGH USAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If an animal became weaker due to working, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chilkiya brei d'Rav Avya):</span> This implies that if it died due to working, he would be liable. This is unreasonable. He borrowed it to work!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Not only if an animal became weaker due to working, rather, even if it died, he is exempt, for he borrowed it to work!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Reuven borrowed a lamp from Shimon, and it broke.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Bring witnesses that you did not use it abnormally, and you are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he cannot find witnesses, how much does he pay?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the following case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven borrowed a lamp from Shimon, and it broke (through negligence). Rav obligated him to pay for a proper lamp.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Kahana and Rav Asi:</span> Is that really the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav was silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Halachah follows Rav Kahana and Rav Asi. Reuven returns the pieces, and pays the decreased value.</p>
