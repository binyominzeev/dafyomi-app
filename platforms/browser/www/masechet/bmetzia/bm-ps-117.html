<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW THE RENTER TAKES OVER THE OWNER'S HOUSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> When Shimon lives below, is he alone?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, may Reuven dwell with him, for he never agreed to be expelled from his own house!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If Reuven dwells with him, does Shimon enter normally, or must he enter (his Aliyah as he used to, via a ladder, and then) down a ladder from his Aliyah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is Shimon required to live like he used to, climbing up to his roof?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, can he say 'I consented only to climb to enter my house, but not to descend as well!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If Shimon can say 'I never consented to climb and descend' if there were two Aliyos on top of the house, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Obviously, if the top story sinks, Shimon must accept the middle story, for it is less climbing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the middle story sinks, must Shimon accept the top story?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Can Reuven say 'you consented to climb to enter your house. You must merely climb more!'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, can Shimon say 'I consented to climb only one story, not two!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>These questions are not resolved. (Rambam - the last question is not resolved. The first questions are resolved the way the following question suggested.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CEILING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> Reuven must supply the ceiling...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> It is wicker mats.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Stini):</span> It is cedar boards.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They do not argue. Each teaches what is standard in his region.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Reuven lived in a house and Shimon lived in its Aliyah. The plaster (of the Aliyah floor) came off; when Shimon would wash his hands, the water would drip into the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Shimon must fix it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila'i):</span> Reuven must fix it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Chiya bar Aba and R. Ila'i argue like R. Yosi and Chachamim argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chiya bar Aba says that the upper dweller must fix it (like R. Yosi, who obligates him to supply the plaster) because the damager must distance himself from damaging;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Ila'i says that the lower dweller must fix it (like Chachamim) because the victim must distance himself from being damaged.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yosi and Chachamim hold just the contrary!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We distance a tree 25 Amos from a pit. A carob or sycamore tree must be distanced 50 Amos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This applies in all cases, whether the tree is above, below or even with the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the pit was there first, the tree must be cut, and the owner of the pit must pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the tree was there first, the tree is not cut.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yosi says, even if the pit was there first we do not cut the tree;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like one may dig in his own property, one may plant in his own property!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>This shows that R. Yosi obligates the victim to distance himself, and Chachamim obligate the damager to distance himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rather, we can say that R. Chiya bar Aba and R. Ila'i argue like R. Yosi and Chachamim argue in that Mishnah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chiya bar Aba obligates the damager to distance himself, like Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Ila'i obligates the victim to distance himself, like R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do R. Yosi and Chachamim argue about in our Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether plaster is needed to support the ceiling. (Reuven is not bothered by dripping water, rather, Shimon is concerned about the sturdiness of his floor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold that plaster is needed to support the ceiling, therefore Reuven must supply it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi holds that pegs suffice to support the ceiling. Plaster is only to make it smooth, therefore Shimon must supply it (if he wants).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Ashi taught that R. Yosi admits that the damager may not send arrows (precipitate damage directly. Why does R. Ila'i exempt Shimon?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the water does not fall straight down, so this is not considered arrows.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BENEFITING WITHOUT CAUSING ANOTHER PERSON A LOSS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a two-story house fell, and Shimon (who owns the Aliyah) wants to rebuild it but Reuven (who owns the ground floor) refuses, Shimon may build (one story) and live there. Reuven may not live there until he pays Shimon's expenses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, if Shimon lives there, he must pay rent to Reuven;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, Shimon builds both stories, then he may live in the house until Reuven pays the expenses (of the ground floor. Since Shimon could live in the Aliyah, he does not benefit from Reuven's house.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">117b----------------------------------------117b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yehudah teaches that one may not benefit from Ploni's money (without Ploni's consent) in our Mishnah and in two other Mishnayos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven asked Shimon to dye wool red, and he died it black, or vice-versa, Shimon pays the value of the wool he received;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, Reuven pays the increased value or Shimon's expenses, whichever is smaller.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> Reuven paid part of his debt to Shimon. He fixed a date and gave the document to Levi, and said 'if I do not pay the rest by this date, give the document to Shimon (who may then collect the full amount).' If Reuven does not pay in time, Levi gives the document to Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehudah says, he does not give it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Yehudah (normally permits, but) forbids in our Mishnah because living in a house blackens the walls (causing a loss)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps he makes the dyer return the wool because he deviated;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone who deviates has the lower hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Perhaps he says that Levi does not give the document to Shimon because this was Asmachta (an exaggerated promise), and we know that R. Yehudah holds that a condition of Asmachta is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>REBUILDING THE HOUSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Ada):</span> If the wall was originally cut stones, and Reuven (the bottom dweller) wants to rebuild (the part incumbent on him, i.e. up to the ceiling) from uncut stones, he may. (Uncut stones are generally a Tefach thicker, as the Mishnah says at the beginning of Bava Basra, thus making the wall even stronger.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was originally uncut stones, he may not rebuild it (thinner) from cut stones;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was originally bricks, he may rebuild it (thicker) from half-bricks. If it was originally half-bricks, he may not rebuild it (thinner) from bricks.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he wants to use cedar wood for the ceiling (in place of sycamore, which is lighter and weaker), he may, but not vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He may rebuild it with less windows than originally, but not with more (this weakens the wall);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>He may rebuild it lower than originally, but not higher (this is less stable, and also it is extra exertion for Shimon to get to his Aliyah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If neither can afford to rebuild it, and the owner of the land wants to sell the land, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> Reuven gets two thirds of the money, Shimon gets one third;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Others say, Reuven gets three quarters of the money, Shimon gets one quarter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Nasan. He was the Av Beis Din, and he delved to the heart of the law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An Aliyah decreases the longevity of a house by a third. Therefore we considered the Aliyah's owner to own a third of the house, and therefore a third of the land.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>OTHER LAWS OF WALLS THAT FALL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The same applies if Shimon owned a garden on top of Reuven's olivepress built in a rock, and the roof of the olivepress - which is the garden floor - sank: Shimon may plant below until Reuven builds a support for the garden floor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Levi's tree or wall fell into the Reshus ha'Rabim and damaged, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Beis Din gave him time to cut the tree or destroy the wall and it fell within the time, he is exempt. If it fell after the time, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven's wall was next to Shimon's garden and it fell, and Shimon told him to clear away the rocks, he must do so. He cannot say 'they are yours (now; clear away them yourself)'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon agreed to take them, later Reuven cannot say 'I will pay your expenditures and take them back.'</p>
