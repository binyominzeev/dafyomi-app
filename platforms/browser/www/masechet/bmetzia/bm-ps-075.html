<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BORROWING WHAT ONE HAS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not say 'lend to me a Kor of wheat on condition that I will return a Kor after the harvest';</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He may ask for a loan until his son comes or he finds the key (to get to wheat he has now);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Hillel forbids this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Similarly, Hillel forbids a woman to lend a loaf to her neighbor until she sets a price for it, lest wheat rise in price and she will give (back a loaf worth more, which is) Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> When the borrower has wheat, he may borrow the quantity he has.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> If one has a Se'ah, he may borrow many Korim (a Kor is 30 Sa'im.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yitzchak - R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> (One may not lend wine (or oil)) when he does not have even a drop of wine (or oil);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he has, he may borrow many drops.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Hillel forbids this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows Hillel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Halachah does not follow Hillel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, Hillel forbids a woman to lend...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Chachamim argue. They permit lending without fixing a price.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a group of people lend to each other and are insistent to get back no less than they gave, they transgress (on Shabbos and Yom Tov) measuring, weighing and counting, lending and repaying on Yom Tov, and according to Hillel, also Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PERMISSION FOR <i>RIBIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> When Chachamim lend to each other, the borrower may return a little more than he borrowed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They know that Ribis is forbidden. The excess is a gift (that he would have given even without the loan. Ramban - this applies to needs of a meal. Chachamim are not insistent to get back what they gave.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Shmuel (to Avuha bar Ihi):</span> Lend to me 100 peppers. I will return an extra 20. This is permitted, for it is only a gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ramban) Shmuel (to Avuha bar Ihi):</span> Lend to me 100 peppers. I will not be careful to return only 100, I may add an extra 20. This is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (Gra YD 160:39) Shmuel (to Avuha bar Ihi):</span> Lend to me 100 peppers. Even if I will return an extra 20, this is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may lend to people of his household on Ribis, to teach them how severe its consequences are.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is forbidden, lest they come to desire to receive Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER KINDS OF <i>RIBIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven may say to Shimon 'weed or dig with me today, and I will do so with you tomorrow';</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He may not say 'weed with me today, and I will dig with you (Rashi - at a later date)' or vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">75b----------------------------------------75b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>All the days (of summer) when the ground is dry are the same. (We are not concerned lest one day be longer or harder to work on than the other.) All the days of the Revi'a (expected days for rainfall) are the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>He may not say 'plow with me today (in summer), and I will plow with you in the Revi'a' (for then it is harder).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Gamliel says, there is pre-loan Ribis and post-loan Ribis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven wanted to borrow from Shimon, he may not give him a gift 'in order that you will lend to me.' This is pre-loan Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven borrowed from Shimon and returned the money, he may not give him a gift 'due to the money you lent to me.' This is post-loan Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Shimon says, there is Ribis of words. The borrower may not inform the lender of Ploni's coming.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE TRANSGRESSIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> The following transgress a Lav: the lender, the borrower, the Arev (guarantor) and the witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, even the scribe transgresses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They transgress "Lo Siten", "Al Tikach me'Ito", "Lo Sihyeh Lo ke'Nosheh", "Lo Sesimun Alav Neshech" and "v'Lifnei Iver Lo Siten Michshol."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If Reuven owes Shimon, and he normally did not greet him with Shalom, it is forbidden for him to do so. "Neshech Kol Davar" forbids even words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> These transgress...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The lender transgresses all of them. The borrower transgresses "Lo Sashich l'Achicha", "ul'Achicha Lo Sashich" and "Lifnei Iver." The Arev and witnesses transgress only "Lo Sesimun."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Those who lend on Ribis lose more than they gain;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Further, they deny the Chachmah of Moshe and the truth of his Torah, as if he only forbade Ribis because he did not recognize its benefit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> If Reuven cannot pay his debt to Shimon, Shimon may not pass in front of him - "Lo Sihyeh Lo k'Nosheh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami and R. Asi):</span> It is like giving Reuven two punishments - "va'Esh uva'Mayim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Anyone who lends money without witnesses transgresses "Lifnei Iver."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He brings a curse upon himself - "Te'alamnah (will become mute) Sifsei Shaker ha'Doveros Al Tzadik" (the borrower will deny, and people will suspect that he falsely claims from him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rabanan told Rav Ashi that Ravina fulfills everything Chachamim say. To test him, Rav Ashi sent a message on Erev Shabbos asking to borrow ten gold pieces, in order to buy a piece of land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> You must send witnesses, we will write a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Do you suspect even me?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> All the more so, I suspect someone like you. You are always learning. You might forget the loan. I would cause a curse to myself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three people cry and are not answered: one who lends money without witnesses, one who acquires a master for himself, and one whose wife rules over him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of one who acquires a master for himself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He denies his wealth by saying that it belongs to a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He writes his property to his children in his lifetime.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> It is bad in his city for him, and yet he remains there.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'SOCHER ES HA'UMENIM</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WORKERS WHO WERE DECEIVED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven hired workers and they tricked each other, they have only complaints against each other;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven hired a donkey-driver or wagon-driver to bring wood (for a canopy) or flutes for a wedding or funeral, or workers to take his flax from the water it was soaking in, or anything that entails a loss (if not done immediately), and they retracted:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there are no other workers there (to do the job for the proper wage), he hires others for more (and those who retracted must pay the excess), or tricks the retractors into working.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven hired workers and they retracted, they have the lower hand. If Reuven retracts, he has the lower hand.</p>
