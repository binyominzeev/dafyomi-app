<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN A FIELD ACQUIRES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Torah says that a Chatzer acquires like a person's hand, but it can also acquire like a Shali'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Get is disadvantageous for her. Something disadvantageous may be done only in front of the person it harms;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A gift is advantageous. Something advantageous may be done for a person in his absence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven saw people chasing an Aveidah in his field... (and said... his field acquires).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> This is only if one could chase and catch it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> What is the law regarding a gift?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> Regarding a gift, even if one cannot catch it, the field acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one threw a wallet through a Chatzer, and it left the Chatzer before landing (Rashi - he made it Hefker; Tosfos - he intended to give it for a gift), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is being suspended in the air, in a Reshus in which the object will not land, like resting on the ground, or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven saw people chasing...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> This is only if one could chase and catch it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> What is the law regarding a gift?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> Regarding a gift, even if one cannot catch it, the field acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Something moving on the ground is different. Clearly, it is considered to be resting.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT MINORS FIND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven receives Metzi'os found by his small (minor) sons and daughters, his male and female Kena'ani slaves, and his wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If his big (adult) sons or daughters, male or female (Yisre'elim) slaves, or his ex-wife (even if he didn't pay her Kesuvah yet) found a Metzi'ah, they keep it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel) Question:</span> Why did Chachamim say that Reuven receives Metzi'os found by his minor son?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> When he finds it, he immediately brings it to his father. (He picked it up with intent to give it to him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This shows that Shmuel holds that a minor cannot acquire mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven (a rich man) was hired to harvest, his son may walk after him and take Leket (Peros that falls during harvesting and must be left for the poor);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven receives a fixed percentage of the harvest, his son may not take Leket after him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, in either case his wife and children may take Leket after him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Granted, if a minor can acquire this is permitted because the child acquires for himself, then gives to his father;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But if a minor cannot acquire, he takes for his father. This should be forbidden, for his father is rich!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Shmuel explained the Tana of our Mishnah (why the father gets the Metzi'os), but Shmuel himself rules like R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yosi holds that a minor cannot acquire mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> To promote Shalom, it is considered stealing to take the Metzi'ah of a child, lunatic or Cheresh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, it is absolute theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> It is absolute theft mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They argue about whether or not Beis Din forces one to return it to them. R. Yosi says that Beis Din forces him; Chachamim say that they do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Really, R. Yosi agrees that mid'Oraisa, minors cannot acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He permits a worker's children to take the Leket because the poor people despair from it, just like they despair after Nemushos (old people who walk with canes, or the second wave of collectors) passes. They assume that the worker's children will take it all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection: (Rav Ada bar Masnah):</span> One may not force poor people to despair from taking what they are entitled to!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Even though minors cannot acquire, Chachamim enacted to allow them to collect as if they can acquire.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The poor are happy with the law, for when they themselves are hired, their children can collect after them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Shmuel argues with R. Chiya bar Aba.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> 'Small' and 'big' in the Mishnah do not refer to minor and adult;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, any child fed by his father is called small. Any child who feeds himself is called big.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>METZI'OS</i> OF SLAVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> What his male and female slaves (Yisre'elim) find, they keep.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Their law should be like workers!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A worker keeps what he finds. This is only if he was hired for a particular job, e.g. 'weed (or hoe) with me today';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'work for me today', the employer gets it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> The case is, the slave makes holes in pearls (in order to thread them, a  very high-priced labor). The master does not want the slave to stop working to pick up Metzi'os. (Therefore, the slave acted on his own behalf. He must compensate his master for the time he stopped working to take the object.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The case is, the slave picked it up while he worked. Since his labor was not diminished at all, he keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> The Beraisa discusses a worker hired to pick up Metzi'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who would hire a worker for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A river overflowed its banks, taking many fish with it; the overflowed water dried up, leaving many dead fish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of the Amah (Yisraelis slave) in the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she brought two hairs (after 12 years , and became a Na'arah), she is free!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she is still a minor, if she has a father, he gets her Metzi'os. If her father died, that frees her!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that a Yisraelis slave goes free if her father dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (She is a minor, and her father died.) Reish Lakish was refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Also our Mishnah refutes Reish Lakish!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We could say that her father is alive (and he gets her Metzi'os). The Mishnah says 'they belong to them' only to teach that the master does not receive them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> What his ex-wife finds...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, she keeps what she finds!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she is divorced and not divorced (i.e. Safek divorced).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Wherever the Tana'im said 'divorced and not divorced', her husband must feed her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Normally, Chachamim enacted that a man gets his wife's Metzi'os, to avoid enmity. Here, enmity is preferable (so he will divorce her absolutely)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A FOUND DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one finds a document saying that Reuven lent money to Shimon, if it has Achrayus (it puts a lien on Shimon's land), he may not return it, because Beis Din will make Shimon pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it has no Achrayus, he should return it, because Beis Din will not make him pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, in either case he may not return it, because Beis Din will make him pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon admits (that he owes the money), if it has Achrayus why not return it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he does not admit, if it has no Achrayus, why should one return it?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Granted, Reuven cannot collect from land that Shimon sold, but he can collect from Shimon's own property (and money)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Really, Shimon admits. We are concerned lest the loan was given after the date on the document;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven could use the document to illegally collect property that Shimon sold after the date but before the loan was given.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should be concerned for this regarding all documents!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned only when something is amiss (e.g. the document was lost).</p>
