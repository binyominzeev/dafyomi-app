<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ARGUMENT OF R. YOCHANAN AND REISH LAKISH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Regarding a Get, all agree that her Chatzer acquires like her hand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about a Metzi'ah. R. Yochanan learns from Get to a Metzi'ah. Reish Lakish does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, all agree that regarding a girl we learn from Get to a Metzi'ah (that her Chatzer acquires like her hand);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about a boy. R. Yochanan learns a boy from a girl (his Chatzer acquires like his hand), Reish Lakish does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish do not argue at all. They discuss different things;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Reish Lakish taught that a boy does not acquire through his Chatzer or four Amos. R. Yochanan said that a girl acquires through them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Reish Lakish said that a girl does not acquire a Metzi'ah through her Chatzer or four Amos. R. Yochanan said that she acquires a Get through her Chatzer or four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ACQUISITION THROUGH A FIELD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven saw people chasing an Aveidah in his field, e.g. after a lame deer, or chicks that cannot flutter, and said 'my field should acquire for me', he acquires;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they were chasing a healthy deer or chicks that can flutter, saying 'my field should acquire for me' does nothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> This is only when Reuven is standing by his field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> His field should acquire for him (even if he is not there)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> A man's field acquires for him without his knowledge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only when it is guarded. If not, it acquires only if he is there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If Reuven was in the city, and said 'I know that workers forgot a sheaf in my field. It should not be Shichechah (a forgotten sheaf, which must be left for the poor)', perhaps it is not Shichechah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "And you will forget a sheaf in the field" - when you forget (when you are) in the field, but not when you forget in the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said 'one might have thought that it is not Shichechah...', which implies that it is Shichechah. We expounded the verse to teach that in the city it is <i>not</i> Shichechah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We expound that when he is in the field, it is Shichechah only if it was forgotten from the beginning, but not if it was remembered and then forgotten;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he is there, his field acquires for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>When he is in the city, even if he remembered and then forgot it, it is Shichechah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he is not there, his field does not acquire for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Torah teaches differently! It is Shichechah only when he is in the field, but not when he is in the city!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Do not return to take it" includes Shichechah when he is in the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need that verse to teach that one who takes it transgresses a Lav!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It could have said "do not take it" to make it a Lav. "Do not return" includes Shichechah of the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need "do not return" to teach a different law!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> What is in front (of one harvesting) is not Shichechah. What is in back of him is Shichechah, for "do not return" applies to it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The general rule is, Shichechah is only when "do not return" applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> "It will be" includes Shichechah of the city.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MUST ONE BE BY THE FIELD?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula and Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The field acquires only when he is standing by it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba - Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in which R. Gamliel was on a boat with R. Yehoshua and R. Akiva. He said 'the tithe that I will separate (for Ma'aser Rishon) is given to R. Yehoshua. The area it rests on is rented to him;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The second tithe that I will separate (for Ma'aser Oni) is given to R. Akiva, who will acquire on behalf of the poor. The area it rests on is rented to him.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua and R. Akiva were not by the field, yet they acquired!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> You ask like one who has never learned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Aba repeated this dialogue in front of Rabanan in Sura.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (a Chacham):</span> The land did not acquire the tithes for them. Rather, they acquired them Agav (along with) acquiring the land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Zeira accepted this answer, but R. Aba did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Indeed, this answer is unacceptable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't they acquire them through Chalipin? Surely they had a garment to do Chalipin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> We must say, since R. Gamliel did not own the tithes themselves, only the Tovas Hana'ah (the right to give it to the Levi or Oni of his choice), Chalipin does not work;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Similarly, one cannot acquire something Agav (land) when the giver owns only Tovas Hana'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>(Rather, R. Gamliel allowed them to acquire it, like one acquires Hefker. The field acquired it for them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question g:1):</span> Chalipin cannot be used for gifts to a Kohen because the Torah said they should be <i>given</i>. Chalipin is a method of commerce;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Agav is a method of giving, so it can be used.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE <i>HALACHAH</i> IS DIFFERENT WHEN SOMEONE GIVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 3:b - Rav Papa):</span> The case of R. Gamliel is different. Since one (with Da'as, i.e. intelligence) gave the tithes, the field can acquire even if the owner is not there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven saw people chasing an Aveidah in his field... (his field acquires).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> This is only if one could chase and catch (the lame deer, or chicks that cannot flutter).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> What is the law regarding a gift?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> Regarding a gift, even if one cannot catch them, the field acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a gift different?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is because one with Da'as gave it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Simi):</span> One with Da'as gives a Get, yet Ula taught that (when the husband threw it into his wife's Chatzer or house) she is divorced only if she is by her Chatzer or house!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> A Get is different, because she acquires it against her will.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes brei d'Rav Idi):</span> That is illogical!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though she acquires a Get against her will, she must be by her Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One chooses to receive a gift. All the more so he must be by the field!</p>
