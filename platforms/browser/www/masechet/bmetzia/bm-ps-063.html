<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RETURNING <i>PEROS</i> IN PLACE OF MONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Oshaya.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya - Beraisa):</span> Yehudah told Levi 'give me the Maneh you owe me so I can buy wheat'. Levi answered 'I have wheat. I will give you a Maneh's worth of my wheat at today's price.' The price of wheat rose; Yehudah asked for the wheat in order to buy wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> 'I have wine. I will give you wine equal in value to your wheat at today's price'. The price of wine rose; Yehudah asked for the wine in order to buy oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> 'I have oil. I will give you oil equal in value to your wine at today's price'. In all these cases, it is permitted if Levi has the Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Mishnah says 'he bought', i.e., with the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We learn three things from R. Oshaya:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may convert a loan into Peros, unlike the Beraisa Rabah brought (62b);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is permitted only if the borrower has the Peros;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yanai, who says that the Peros are like the money, is correct.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Amanah of Peros (Reuven pays Shimon for Peros (at today's price), which Shimon will give later when the price will be higher) is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Amanah of money (Reuven pays Shimon for Peros (at today's price); later, when the price will be higher, Shimon will pay Reuven the value of the Peros) is forbidden (since he gives and receives money, it looks like Ribis).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> Getting back their value (in money) is like getting back the Peros. Both are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Beraisa):</span> It is permitted (to receive back money) if Levi has the Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The case is, he did Meshichah on the Peros (took them to his premises, at the beginning, therefore, it was no longer like a loan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, obviously it is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he designated a corner of the Peros that will be Yehudah's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Shmuel):</span> The Beraisa is R. Yehudah, who permits Tzad Echad b'Ribis (a deal that will end up either like a sale or like a loan).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Reuven owed Shimon 100; he said that if he does not pay by a certain date, Shimon will get his field. This is permitted only if Reuven eats the Peros in the interim (lest he will pay, and it was always a loan, and Shimon's eating was Ribis);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah permits even if Shimon eats the Peros in the interim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> There was a case in which R. Elazar ben Azaryah authorized the buyer to eat the Peros!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No, the seller ate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> They argue about Tzad Echad b'Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> They argue about whether or not one may take Ribis on condition to return it.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CONTRACTING TO SUPPLY <i>PEROS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Since R. Yanai says that money is like the Peros, we may say that Peros are like money, and we may contract to supply Peros for a set price even if the seller has no Peros (as long as there is a set price in the market).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa - Beraisa):</span> It is permitted only if Levi has the Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> That refers to a loan. I discuss a sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> The reason one may contract to supply Peros even if he has no Peros is because he does not give anything extra to the buyer. Had the buyer kept his money, he could have bought Peros cheaply elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, a loan of a Se'ah on condition to return a Se'ah should be permitted, for the borrower does not give anything extra to the lender It would not have spoiled!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> A loan is forbidden. We permit only a sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Aba):</span> The buyer saves the fee he would have had to pay someone to go to buy where the Peros are cheap!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Indeed, it is permitted only when the buyer pays that to the seller.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> (In any case buyers need not pay for this.) Donkey-drivers (for the sake of their own employment) go to seek the buyers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> If Reuven gave money based on the (low) price of the first grain to reach the market, he must see the seller thresh in the granary.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be to acquire it, for seeing is not an acquisition!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is so the seller will be cursed (He who punished...) if he retracts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He will be cursed even if Reuven does not go to see!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is so the seller will be cursed (if he retracts);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Buyers often give money to more than one seller based on the price of the first grain. If he comes to the granary, the seller is assured that the buyer will buy. If he does not come , the seller assumes that the buyer preferred someone else's Peros (so we do not curse him for retracting).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Since this is the reason, the same applies if they met in the market and the buyer said that he expects to receive the Peros.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE GENERAL RULE OF <i>RIBIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The general rule of Ribis is that any payment for allowing one to borrow money for a period of time is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If wax was selling for four cakes per Zuz, and one seller offered five if the buyer would pay now and receive the wax later, this is permitted only if he has wax now.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the seller already gave someone else money to receive wax. One might have thought that he is like one who borrows a Se'ah on condition to return a Se'ah, and he already has it at home;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nachman teaches that this is not so. Since he has not collected his wax, it is as if he does not have it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE WHO RECEIVED TOO MUCH MONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If Reuven borrowed money from Shimon and he received more than he was supposed to, if it is an amount that could be a mistake, he must return it. If it is more than that, Shimon intended it to be a gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is an amount that could be a mistake?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> (People usually count ten or five at a time.) If the error is (Rashi - a multiple of) ten or five, he may have skipped counting some groups of ten or five. If not, it is surely an intentional gift.</p>
