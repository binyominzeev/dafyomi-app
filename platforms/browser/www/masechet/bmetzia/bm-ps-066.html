<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA METZIA 66-67 - Dedicated by Andy & Nancy Neff of Teaneck, N.J. in honor of those who learn the Dafyomi around the world. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EMPTY WORDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> Reuven sold land to Shimon without Achrayus (responsibility to compensate him if a creditor takes it), and saw that Shimon was sad, so he promised 'if it is taken from you, I will return any improvements or Peros (that you made to or grew) on it from my best property', these are empty words. (He just wants to make him feel better.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Is this because the buyer must stipulate, and here the seller stipulated?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Beraisa, if Shimon said 'when you get the money, I will return it to you', this is permitted. Rava explained that this is because Shimon said 'if I want, I will return it.' If not, it would be binding, even though Reuven should stipulate!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> Rava means, (since Reuven needed to stipulate, but Shimon did), it is as if Shimon said 'if I want, I will return it.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A dying person wrote an (unconditional) Get to his wife. He was groaning out of regret.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">His wife:</span> Don't worry. If you recover, I am yours!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zevid):</span> These are empty words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> If they were not empty words, would we say that she made the Get conditional? Only he can do that!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> One might have thought that he gives it like she wants (and she shows that she wants it to be on condition). Rav Zevid teaches that this is not so</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ASMACHTA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Levi lent Yehudah (on condition to keep his field if the loan is not paid within three years...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If the condition was made when the money was given, it is binding (even if the field is worth more than the loan). If the condition was made afterwards, Levi gets land only according to the amount of the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Even if the condition was made afterwards, it is binding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Nachman ruled like his opinion in a case involving the Reish Galusa. Rav Yehudah tore up the document. The Reish Galusa informed Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rav Nachman:</span> He is a great man. Surely he found a good reason to tear it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Nachman:</span> That was childish. The Halachah follows me in monetary laws!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rav Nachman):</span> Even if the condition was made when the money was given, it is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If Levi lent Yehudah and said 'if the loan is not paid within three years, it will be my field', he gets it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> I used to hold that Asmachta (an exaggerated promise) acquires. Minyomi convinced me that it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah refutes Minyomi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah is R. Yosi, who says that Asmachta acquires (but Chachamim argue).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">66b----------------------------------------66b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, the borrower said 'acquire it from now (on condition that I do not pay in time)'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Yanuka and Mar Kashisha, sons of Rav Chisda):</span> In Neharda'a, they cite Rav Nachman to say that Asmachta acquires (when he does not pay up) in the (set) time, but not in the time (rather, before it) it does not acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> Any acquisition acquires only at the proper time, not before!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rav Ashi):</span> Perhaps Rav Nachman means that if they met within the allotted time and Yehudah (the borrower) said 'acquire it (I will not pay)', Levi acquires (since Yehudah was under no pressure to pay now, surely he was sincere);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they met after the allotted time and Yehudah said 'acquire it', Levi does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yehudah was insincere. He was just embarrassed to say that he cannot pay now.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even if they met within the allotted time, Levi does not acquire. Yehudah only intended that Levi not press him for payment when the time comes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav Papa):</span> Sometimes Asmachta acquires, and sometimes it does not. If (on the last day to pay) Levi finds Yehudah drinking beer (he is not worried about keeping his field), Levi acquires;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Yehudah was trying to raise the money, Levi does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> Perhaps Yehudah was drinking to calm his nervousness (about raising the money), or someone promised to give him the money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Ravina):</span> Rather, if Yehudah is insistent not to sell his belongings below their value (this shows that he is not concerned to raise the money), Levi acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> Perhaps Yehudah is concerned lest people not give the proper price for his land if they see that he is desperate to raise money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rav Papa):</span> Rather, if Yehudah is insistent not to sell any land, Levi acquires.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AN APUTIKI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Even though Asmachta does not acquire, the land is an Aputiki, i.e. the loan will be collected only from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Nasan):</span> Yehudah never told Levi to acquire the land to collect from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Mari):</span> Even had he told Levi to acquire the land to collect from it, that is Asmachta, so he does not acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case in which Rav Papa said that Asmachta does not acquire, and the land is an Aputiki?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He said 'you will be paid only from this land.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Reuven bought land from Shimon with Achrayus. He requested 'if the land is taken from me, compensate me from Idi Idis (the best of your best lands)'. Shimon agreed to give Idis, but not his Idi Idis. The land was taken from Reuven; a river flooded Shimon's Idi Idis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Shimon agreed to give (other) Idis. He still has Idis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> Shimon only agreed to this assuming that his Idi Idis was intact. Now that it is not, his Idis is his Idi Idis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav bar Sheva owed money to Rav Kahana. He fixed a date, and said 'if I don't pay by then, you can collect from this wine.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> We say that Asmachta does not acquire only regarding land, for it is not destined to be sold. Wine is destined to be sold, so it is like money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Rava said that any (promise starting with) 'if' does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MISTAKEN PARDON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Since we say that Asmachta does not acquire, the land and any Peros that the buyer ate revert to the original owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rav Nachman hold that if one pardoned a debt based on a mistaken assumption, the pardon is invalid? (He contradicts himself!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If Reuven sold the fruits (that will grow) on his date tree, he can retract until they grow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> He can retract even after they grow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> I admit that if the buyer ate them, he need not compensate Reuven (even though Reuven did not know that he could retract).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mistaken pardon helps regarding a sale, but not regarding a loan (for it looks like Ribis).</p>
