<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED ONE <i>ISKA</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If two documents were written for one Iska, it is considered two investments. This hurts the lender (if there is a loss on one and a gain on the other, his share of the loss is more than his share of the gain, so it is not Ribis. Had it all been in one document, the loss and profit would have cancelled each other);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If two Iskos were combined into one document, it is considered one investment. This hurts the borrower (if there is a loss on one and a gain on the other, they cancel each other. Had it all been in two documents, his share of the loss would have been less than his share of the gain.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven received an Iska from Shimon, and there was a loss, and Reuven then toiled (R. Chananel - after the time for the Iska expired; Ra'avad - using money of another Iska) and recovered the loss, without telling Shimon, he cannot force Shimon to accept a larger share of the loss than of the gain;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon can say that Reuven toiled in order that people will not say that he is a failure regarding Iska.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven and Shimon jointly received an Iska from Levi, and there was a profit, and Reuven wanted to stop in the middle, Shimon can demand that they continue for the agreed time;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven cannot demand to take his share of the profits, because the profit is tied to the principal (perhaps they will need to use the profits).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He cannot demand to take his share of the profits and principal. Each partner's share is tied to the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Even if Reuven offers 'if you will lose, I will share the loss with you', Shimon can demand that they stay together, for the Mazal of two people is better than that of one.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>RESPONSIBILITY OF A WORKER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Chocher a field from Shimon; he cannot refuse to weed, even though he pays the agreed rental;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon can say 'I do not want the field to be full of weeds when you leave.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Even if Reuven offers to plow afterwards to kill the weeds, Shimon can refuse. He can say 'if you do not weed, (my share of the) the Peros will be low quality.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven cannot offer to buy good Peros to pay the rental. Shimon can demand Peros of his own field.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reuven cannot offer to weed only the portion from which he must pay the rental. Shimon can say 'I do not want my land to get a bad reputation.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Mishnah):</span> Shimon can say 'I do not want the field to be full of weeds when you leave.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is Shimon's only claim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, Reuven's offer to plow afterwards is insufficient, for seeds of the weeds will sprout the next year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven accepted to be a sharecropper on Shimon's field and it produced very little, if it produces enough to make a pile, Reuven must work it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> That is unreasonable (the quantity should depend on the size of the field)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it must yield as much as the seeds (this will be explained later).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven accepted to be a sharecropper on Shimon's field and it produced very little, if it produces enough to make a pile, Reuven must work it, for he writes 'I will plow, seed, harvest, thresh, winnow and make a pile, and we will each take half.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered a pile?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Ii enough that the pitchfork will stand in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the prongs can be seen from both sides, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> The prongs must be totally covered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Levi):</span> It must produce three Sa'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(D'Vei R. Yanai):</span> It must produce two Sa'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The two Sa'im are above the expenditures.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LAWS OF <i>TUM</i>'<i>AH</i> THAT DEPEND ON WEAK THINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Pritzei (this will be explained) olives and grapes receive Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel say, they do not receive Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Pritzei olives?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> They are bad olives that never fully ripen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much oil can they produce and still be considered Pritzei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> The limit is four Kavim of oil from the amount of olives pressed at once under a beam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> It is two Sa'im (12 Kavim) from this amount of olives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They do not argue. In R. Elazar's area, one Kor (30 Sa'im) of olives are pressed under a beam at once. In R. Yanai's area, three Kor are pressed.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">105b----------------------------------------105b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Zav (a man Tamei due to emissions) and a Tahor person went together on a weak tree or branch, the Tahor person is Tamei. (Rambam - the Zav makes the tree or branch bend. This moves the Tahor person.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered a weak tree?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> At the trunk (Chachmas Mano'ach - where the branches come out), it is too thin to carve out a quarter of a Kav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered a weak branch?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> It is so thin that it can be concealed (surrounded) by one's hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (A Beis ha'Pras is a field in which a grave was plowed. We are concerned lest the plow dragged bones.) If one walked through a Beis ha'Pras on top of rocks that one can move, or rode on a weak person or animal, he is Tamei (mid'Rabanan, for perhaps his weight helped move a bone).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered a weak person?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> When he carries someone, his knees knock together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered a weak animal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> When one rides it, it excretes.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>LOADS THAT MUST BE PUT DOWN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(D'Vei R. Yanai):</span> Four Kavim is the quantity for prayer and Tefilin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which law of prayer does he refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If one is carrying a load on his shoulder, if it is less than four Kavim, he casts it on his back and prays. If it is four Kavim or more, he must put it down before praying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which law of Tefilin does he refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> One may not carry a load of four Kavim on his head while wearing Tefilin on his head if it compresses them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it does not compress them, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> If one is wearing Tefilin and carries manure on his head, he should not move the head Tefilin to the side or tie them on his thigh, for this is disgraceful;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, he should tie them on his arm, next to his hand Tefilin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(D'Vei Shila):</span> One may not carry even a Tefilin bag on his head while wearing Tefilin on his head.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to d'Vei Shila, how much may one carry on his head along with Tefilin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Even a 16th of a Litra of Pumbedisa is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE AMOUNT OF <i>PEROS</i> WORTH FARMING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> It is unreasonable to say 'a pile.' Rather, it must yield as much as the seeds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer #1 (R. Ami citing R. Yochanan):</span> It is when a Beis Kor produces (enough grain so that the volume of its seeds is) four Sa'im (Gra - four Kavim. Normally, when seeded, this produces a Kor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer #1 (R. Ami citing R. Yochanan):</span> It is when the amount of land fitting to produce a Kor of Peros produces only four Sa'im (the amount needed to seed land of this size). (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Ami himself):</span> It is when that amount of land produces eight Sa'im (Gra - Kavim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(An elder):</span> (They do not argue). In R. Yochanan's day, land was more fertile. From (Rashi - the yield of) four Sa'im one could seed such an area of land. In R. Ami's day, eight Sa'im were needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If wind scattered Reuven's sheaves (and we do not know how much Leket (fallen sheaves that must be left for the poor) was there), we estimate how much Leket normally falls, and he gives this to the poor;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, (we need not estimate;) he gives the amount of Leket that normally falls (it is fixed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rambam):</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he gives the amount that we seed (in a field of this size). (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> It is four Kavim to a Kor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> Does he mean an area that normally produces a Kor of grain, or in which one plants a Kor of seeds?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravin):</span> It is for a Kor of seed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he refer to seeding by hand, or (when the seeds fall from a punctured Kli drawn) by oxen?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>REGION-WIDE AFFLICTIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was a Chocher on Shimon's field and the crop was stricken by locusts or withered (by the sun or wind):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the entire province was stricken, he deducts from the rental. If not, he pays the full rental.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, if the rent was a fixed amount of money, in either case he pays the full rental.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is a region-wide affliction?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The majority of the valley was stricken.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> Fields in all four directions were stricken.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Questions (according to Ula):</span> If only the closest row of the surrounding fields was stricken, what is the law? If the surrounding fields were stricken, except for the row closest to Shimon's field, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> What if the law if the following separated between them: a fallow field; fields planted for fodder (that were not stricken.
