<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE BOOK OF ADAM HA'RISHON (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(The book also said that) Rebbi and R. Nasan are the end of the Tana'im, Rav Ashi and Ravina are the end of the Amora'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The latter is hinted at in "Mikd<i>ashei</i> Kel <i>Avinah</i> l'Acharisam (at their end)."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DEATH OF RABAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> Rabah died due to fear of the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Someone informed on him that he causes thousands of Yisre'elim to avoid taxes (because they gather to learn from him) for a month in spring and a month in fall. The king sent a Shali'ach to seek him; he did not find him. Rabah fled from Pumbedisa to Akra, then to a swamp, to Shechin, to a hut, to a spring, then back to Pumbedisa. They found him in Pumbedisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The king's Shali'ach came to lodge at the inn Rabah was in. They put food in front of the Shali'ach; they took it away after he drank two cups. (Drinking an even number made him vulnerable to a certain Shed.) His face went in back of his head. Rabah told them to give to him another cup, he was cured.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This made him realize that Rabah was there. He searched for him and found him. He said 'if they will kill me for not revealing where Rabah is, I will die, and not reveal. If they will torture me, I will reveal.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He locked Rabah in a room. Rabah prayed for mercy, and the wall fell. He escaped to the swamp. He was sitting on a stump and learning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>(Shitah Mekubetzes - Rabah dreamed that) the Heavenly academy was learning about Tzara'as:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the Tzara'as (white appearance on the skin) preceded the white hair, he is (absolutely) Tamei; if the white hair came first, he is Tahor (i.e. only quarantined);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If we are in doubt which came first, (Shitah - a group of Chachamim close to) Hash-m said Tahor, and the rest of the Heavenly academy said Tamei. They decided that Rabah would decide the matter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Rabah used to comment 'I am the most learned scholar alive in matters of Tzara'as and Tum'ah of an Ohel.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>The angel of death was sent to take him. He could not, for Rabah never ceased learning. A wind made a big noise among the reeds; Rabah thought it was a troop searching for him. Rabah preferred to die than to be taken by the kingdom. He died amidst saying 'Tahor, Tahor.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">A voice from Heaven:</span> Happy is Rabah. His body is Tahor, and his soul left amidst saying 'Tahor'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In Pumbedisa, a note fell from Heaven that Rabah was taken to the Heavenly academy. Abaye, Rava and all the Rabanan wanted to bury him, but they did not know where he was. They went to the swamp. They saw birds making shade over a certain place, and realized that is the place. They eulogized him for three days and nights. A note fell from Heaven excommunicating anyone who will leave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They eulogized him for seven days; a note fell from Heaven permitting them to go home.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The day he died there was a terrible wind. A man riding a camel was blown across the Papa river. People told him that this was because Rabah died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The man:</span> Hash-m, You own the world, and You own Rabah. Granted, You love him. Will You destroy Your entire world due to him?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The wind abated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One day, R. Shimon ben Chalafta was hot. He sat on top of a mountain, and asked his daughter to fan him, and promised her loaves of spikenard. A wind came. He exclaimed 'how much I owe to the One who sent this wind!'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW MUCH WORKERS MUST BE FED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Everything is like the local custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> In a place where the custom is to eat bread and drink at sunrise, and then to go work, he cannot force them to eat earlier so they will start work earlier.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer:</span> In a place where the custom is to eat and drink in the employer's house and then to go work, he cannot tell them 'start working, and when the food is ready I will bring it to you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in which R. Yochanan ben Masya told his son to hire workers...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The case contradicts the law!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It should say as follows: if he promised to feed them, he must give more than the local custom;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">86b----------------------------------------86b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There was a case in which R. Yochanan ben Masya told his son to hire workers; his son promised to feed them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> They descend from Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov. Even if you give them a banquet like Shlomo's, this does not suffice! Before they start working, tell them that you promise them only bread and legumes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Avraham served a larger meal than Shlomo.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "The daily food of Shlomo was 30 Kor (a Kor is the volume of 4320 eggs) of fine flour, 60 Kor of (regular) flour, ten fattened cattle, 20 cattle (that grazed), 100 flock, aside from deer, fallow deer and Barburim Avusim (this will be explained)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Guryon ben Astiyon):</span> The verse gives only the amount of flour and fine flour to absorb the froth of the pots.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> The verse gives only the amount of meat to make seasoned meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Shlomo had 1000 wives. Each made such a meal for him every night in her house, hoping that he would eat with her that night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Avraham served only "Ben Bakar Rach va'Tov";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This teaches that he served three animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Avraham served three bulls for three guests. Shlomo's meal was for all of "Yehudah v'Yisrael Rabim ka'Chol Asher Al ha'Yam."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are "Barburim Avusim"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> They are hens that we are Oves (force-feed, to fatten them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> They are chickens that were allowed to fatten themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> They would bring to Shlomo's table cattle that never worked ("Bakar Re'i") and hens that were never set to raise chicks (the latter are "Barburim Avusim").</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The choicest domestic animal is an ox; the choicest fowl is a hen. (This is why they only took "spoiled animals" from these two categories.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> Barburim Avusim are black hens with big stomachs (alternately - that were fattened at home) that frequent the winepress at the time grapes are pressed (and eat the skins), and are too fat to step over a reed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE HOSPITALITY OF AVRAHAM AVINU</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Ben-Bakar Rach va'Tov" teaches that he served three bulls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it was only one. The verse teaches that it was tender and good!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said 'Rach Tov.' "Va'Tov" shows that it comes to teach about more animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that there were two, and "Rach" means tender!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since "va'Tov" teaches another animal, also "Rach" does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Ula):</span> "He gave to the lad, and he rushed to prepare <i>Oso</i>" (it, i.e. one animal)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He gave each one to a different lad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "u'Ven ha'Bakar Asher <i>Osah</i> (singular) and put in front of them."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He served each one when it finished cooking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he need to serve three? One bull would suffice for three guests!!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> He wanted to serve each a tongue with mustard.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE ANGELS' VISIT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum bar Chanilai):</span> One should not deviate from the local custom. Moshe went to Heaven, and did not eat. Angels descended to earth, and ate (Avraham's food)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, they did not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they appeared to eat and drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Everything that Avraham did himself for the angels (the first four matters listed below), Hash-m Himself did similarly for Avraham's children (in the wilderness). Everything that Avraham did through a Shali'ach (the fifth matter), Hash-m did for Avraham's children through a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Avraham ran to the herd", and "a wind came me'Es Hash-m (bringing meat, i.e. Slav)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"He took butter and milk", and "I will make bread (fall like) rain for you from Shamayim" (Maharsha - the manna tasted like "Leshad ha'Shamen" (Bamidbar 11:8), i.e.  milk (Yoma 75a));</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"He stood (watching) over them", and "I will stand in front of you by the rock";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Avraham walked with them to escort them", and "Hash-m went in front of them".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"Yukach (will be taken) a little water", and "you (Moshe) will strike the rock and water will exude."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Yehudah argues with R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> In the merit of three things that Avraham did, Yisrael merited three things from Hash-m (through Moshe and Aharon).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Mon was a reward for giving butter and milk. The Amud Anan (the cloud that accompanied Yisrael in the wilderness) was a reward for standing over the angels while they ate. (This is unlike Rav Yehudah.) The well of Miryam was a reward for bringing water for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai b'Rebbi Yishmael):</span> Avraham said "will be taken a little water, and you will wash your feet." The angels rebuked Avraham 'you suspect we worship the dust of our feet?! (You fathered Yishmael, who does so)!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Hash-m appeared to him... k'Chom ha'Yom"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> It was the third day from Avraham's circumcision. Hash-m came to visit him, and He made the sun extra strong so Avraham would not be bothered with guests;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Avraham sent Eliezer to look for guests; he did not find. Avraham did not trust him. This is like they say in Eretz Yisrael, that one cannot trust slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Avraham went out and found Hash-m by the door. He asked "do not pass from Your servant (while I go to invite guests)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Avraham was untying and retying the bandage on the circumcision. Hash-m saw that it was not proper to remain there, so He left. (Also the angels went away for this reason;)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Avraham saw... Nitzavim Alav va'Yar va'Yaratz Likrasam" - at first, they stood over him. They saw his pain, and realized that it was not proper to remain there, so they distanced themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who were the three "men"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Micha'el came to inform Sarah that she will have a son. Refa'el came to heal Avraham. Gavri'el was on his way to destroy Sedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "The two angels came to Sedom"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Micha'el also went, to save Lot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> It says "va'Yahafoch" (singular).</p>
