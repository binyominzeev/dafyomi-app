<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN IS <i>ONA'AH</i> PARDONED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Chachamim, if the Ona'ah was less than a sixth, is it pardoned immediately, or in the time to show it to a merchant or relative?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is in the time to show it (to a merchant or relative), what is the difference between a sixth and less than a sixth?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it is a sixth, he has the upper hand. He can void the sale or demand the Ona'ah. If it is less than a sixth, he can only demand the Ona'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> They reverted to conduct like Chachamim. (We are thinking that any amount less than a third according to R. Tarfon is like less than a sixth according to Chachamim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, if Chachamim allow one to claim less than a sixth in the time to show it, and R. Tarfon allows the whole day, this is why they reverted to conduct like Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if Chachamim say that less than a sixth is immediately pardoned, and R. Tarfon says that less than a third is immediately pardoned, why did they revert? They would profit more according to R. Tarfon (when the Ona'ah was between a sixth and a third)!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">50b----------------------------------------50b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, R. Tarfon holds that between a sixth and a third is like Chachamim say about a sixth, i.e. the buyer can negate the sale or demand the overcharge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why were they happy with R. Tarfon's first law? (Chachamim say, in that case the buyer has no choice; the sale is void!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that Chachamim hold that when the sale is void (more than a sixth), the buyer can always retract (and the merchants assumed that R. Tarfon allows only the time to show it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, they were happy at first. When they heard that the buyer can retract the whole day (even for less than a sixth), they reverted to Chachamim's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if Chachamim allow retracting only within the time to show it even regarding a void sale, why were they originally happy?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They were happy due to the law of exactly a sixth. Chachamim say that this is Ona'ah, and R. Tarfon says that he pardons it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW LONG MAY ONE RETRACT OR CLAIM <i>ONA'AH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Chachamim, when the sale is void, can the buyer always retract, or only until the time to show it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is only until the time to show it, what is the difference between a sixth and more than a sixth?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he overpaid a sixth, only the buyer can void the sale. If it was more than a sixth, either one can void it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> They reverted to Chachamim's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Chachamim allow only the time to show it, and R. Tarfon allows the whole day, we understand why they reverted to Chachamim's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if Chachamim allow the buyer to retract forever, why did they revert? R. Tarfon gives the buyer only one day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Ona'ah large enough to void the sale is uncommon. (Therefore, they preferred Chachamim's opinion, that Ona'ah of a sixth can be claimed only within the time to show it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is: if the Ona'ah is less than a sixth, the sale stands. If it is more than a sixth, the sale is void. If it is exactly a sixth, the Ona'ah is returned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the last two cases, the buyer has until the time to show it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> If the Ona'ah is less than a sixth, the sale stands. If it is more than a sixth, the sale is void. If it is exactly a sixth, the Ona'ah is returned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi says, the seller (or buyer, whoever was deceived) has the upper hand. He can void the sale, or demand payment of the Ona'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He can claim until...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> This refers only to the buyer, but the seller can always claim.</p>
