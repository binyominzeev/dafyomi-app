<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OTHER LAWS OF <i>MASHKANTA</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> If one did not specify, Mashkanta is for a year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The borrower can redeem only after a year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> The word Mashkanta comes from 'd'<i>Shechun</i>ah Gavei' (it resides with him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that if the borrower sells it, the lender has first option to buy it. He is the closest neighbor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is unlike the following: Tarsha of Rav Papa, documents of Chuznai, and land rentals of Narshai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tarsha of Rav Papa - he would sell wine in Tishrei according to the price of Nisan, on condition to be paid later (65A);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Documents of Chuznai - wholesalers who sell goods to merchants (to be paid later), and the amount written in the document is the principal and half the anticipated profit.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is forbidden, for perhaps there will be no profit (and the borrower must pay Ribis)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Mar bar Ameimar:</span> My father does so. If the buyer said that he did not profit, he believed him!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> He should be concerned that if he dies, his heirs might not believe the buyer!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>"Ki'Shgagah she'Yotza mi'Lifnei ha'Shalit" - because Rav Ashi was not careful with his words, Ameimar died immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rentals of Narshai - they write that Reuven took land for collateral, and rented it back to the owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Reuven cannot rent it back, for he never acquired the land!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Nowadays, they write that Reuven acquired the field and it was by him for a while, then he rented it back. This is permitted, to encourage loans.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, also this is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SHARING THE PROFITS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven gave goods to Shimon to sell in a store (for more than the wholesale price. Half the goods are a loan, and half are a deposit. Each gets the profit on his half.) This is permitted only if in addition, he pays him like a worker (for selling Reuven's half);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same applies if he gave money to buy goods and share the profit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he gave eggs to Shimon, to put hens on them to develop chicks and share the profit (the increased value of chicks over eggs), he must pay for Shimon's toil and the chicken feed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same applies if he estimated the value of calves or foals, and asked Shimon to raise them (to share the profits or loss);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He may give calves or foals to Shimon to raise, on condition to evenly share their value when they reach a third of their ultimate growth (Rashi; Rambam - three years) or donkeys until they can bear burdens.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi (Gemara - Beraisa):</span> He is paid like an idle worker (the amount he would want to receive to consent to neglect his work and be idle).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He did not rest. He was selling goods!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">68b----------------------------------------68b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He is paid like a worker would want to receive to engage in light labor (such as selling) instead of his usual (harder) job.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos (Beraisa):</span> He is paid like an idle worker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is the amount a worker would want to receive to rest from his labor. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Mishnah needed to teach both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about selling in a store, one might have thought that since it is light work, he is paid only like an idle worker, but to buy merchandise, he would get his full normal wage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only about buying merchandise, one might have thought that since it is hard work, he is paid like an idle worker, but to sell in a store, he would get a pittance, and even if he ate a drop of Reuven's food, that is enough.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> How much is he paid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Meir):</span> Whatever they stipulate suffices, be it much or little;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> It suffices if he eats vegetables dipped in brine or a dried fig of Reuven;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Shimon):</span> He must receive his full normal wage (like an idle worker).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CARING FOR ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may not estimate and give (to share the profits) goats, sheep or anything that eats and does not work;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah permits goats and sheep, for they give milk and wool, and hens (they lay and hatch eggs).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do Chachamim (the first Tana) say that milk and wool do not suffice for the toil and food?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. If Shimon keeps all the milk and wool, all agree that this is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue when he gets only whey and wool that is washed off the sheep.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim rule like R. Shimon, that he must receive full wages. R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah rules like R. Yehudah, that it suffices if he eats a drop.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Leah has a hen, she may charge Rachel two chicks a year for sitting it on Rachel's eggs;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah says, she may stipulate that they will share the chicks;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Shimon forbids this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yehudah not require that Leah receive wages and food?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He says that it suffices if she keeps the eggs that do not develop into chicks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In a place where one (who raises a young animal) gets wages for carrying it, he must get, we do not change from the local custom;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if the animal's mother was given with the child, he need not get wages (the child need not be carried, for it follows its mother).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Shimon ben Gamliel not require that he get wages and food?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He gets the dung (for fertilizer).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that the owner makes it Hefker anyway, so this is not considered wages.</p>
