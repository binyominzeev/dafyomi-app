<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA METZIA 118-119 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to Rav Weiner -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Orlah applies to what grows out of a stump or roots (whatever grows in the first three years is forbidden);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, Orlah applies to what grows out of the roots, but not to what grows out of the stump.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They needed to argue in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had they argued only about a tree in another's field, one might have thought that R. Yehudah argues only about money, but regarding Orlah, an Isur, he admits (that Orlah applies even to what grows from the stump);</p>
