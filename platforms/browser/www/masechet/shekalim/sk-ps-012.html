<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HALACHAH 4: ONE WHO IS MAKDISH HIS PROPERTY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> If, among that which one is Makdish, there are items which are suited for public Korbanos, they are given as pay to the Mikdash workers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>(Ben Azai):There must be a Chilul process (as above, 11b).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> If there are animals which are suited to be brought on the Mizbeach then:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The male animals are sold to those who need Olos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The females are sold to those who need Shelamim animals,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The funds of both are used for Bedek ha'Bayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> In that case:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The males are offered as Olos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The females are sold to those who need Shelamim animals,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Those funds are used for Olos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>All remaining funds are given to Bedek ha'Bayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> R. Eliezer seems more correct since he creates more consistency.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papayis):</span> They both seem correct such that:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one specifies the animals in his Hekdesh, then they are to be given to Bedek ha'Bayis as indicated by R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the Hekdesh is unspecified, then it is divided as R. Yehoshua indicated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If there are items (such as wine and oil) which can be brought onto the Mizbeach:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They should be sold to those who are bringing such Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>These funds are used to purchase Olos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>RATIONALE FOR THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Suited for public Korbanos" refers to Ketores.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Hoshayah):</span> Since the Mishnah can be speaking of Ketores workers, we may not infer that Ketores may be prepared in Chulin vessels.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Ben Azai holds that Hekdesh may be Mechulal only on coins, and not on payroll.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>RATIONALE FOR R. ELIEZER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chananyah):</span> The Mishnah in Temurah is the opinion of R. Eliezer in our Mishnah (and Hekdesh goes to Bedek ha'Bayis).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Eliezer basis himself on the Pasuk in Vayikra 27:14 which must be speaking of one who is Makdish his general property, and it teaches that such property goes to Bedek ha'Bayis.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THREE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE MACHLOKES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira citing R. Chunah):</span> The dispute is only in a case where he was Makdish property and there were animals among that property, but if he was Makdish his flock, all would agree that it goes to the Mizbeach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ba citing R. Chunah):</span> The argument is when he was Makdish his flock, but all agree when he is Makdish general property that it all goes to Bedek Ha'Bayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what <i>else</i> could he have meant when he was Makdish his flock, if not to the Mizbeach!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His not having mentioned the Mizbeach is an indication that he did <i>not</i> want it to go there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The dispute is in all instances.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>IF THE ANIMALS WERE SOLD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If an animal (which was to have been sold as an Olah and the funds given to Bedek ha'Bayis) was redeemed, it becomes Chulin (unlike an animal which was Kadosh as a Korban and redeemed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This seems supported by the Mishnah in Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chizkiyah citing R. Chisda):</span> They got a blemish and were then redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosah citing R. Chisda):</span> The Mishnah in Temurah seems to support this Din (that if he redeemed a Tamim animal it remains Asur, unlike Bedek Ha'Bayis).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chizkiyah citing R. Yosah):</span> It is logical, since otherwise how could our Mishnah teach that the males are sold for Olos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>No, the blemished animals do receive Kedushas Mizbeach.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>INAPPLICABLE KEDUSHAH AND ITS CONSEQUENCES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If one attempted to place a Kedushah upon an animal which could not receive it (i.e. a female as an Olah, Pesach or Asham) it can still create a Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> There is a difference between an Olah (the female would create a Temurah) and the Pesach and Asham (it would not).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Yehudah):</span> None will create a Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan explained R. Shimon since the Pesach and Asham are never brought as Nekeivos but there <i>is</i> a Nekeivah Olah (by birds, where Tamus and Zachrus do not invalidate).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yochanan explained R. Shimon b. Yehudah that it is a Kal VaChomer from Min b'Mino where the wrong (aged) animal does not take Kedushah (as shown) all the more so the wrong Min.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Shimon and R. Yehoshua both maintain that no Kedushah is created when one is Makdish an animal which is unfit.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehoshua holds that a female for an Olah can only receive Kedushas Damim (but they do not have Kedushas ha'Guf).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon would say the same.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If R. Yehoshua held they received Kedushas ha'Guf, they would need to pasture (and could not be redeemed until they became blemished).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> R. Shimon does not seem correct regarding a Pesach, since there is a Kedushah for a Pesach which is not offered as a Pesach (it can be brought as a Shelamim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then say the same regarding Asham (since surplus Asham is brought as an Olah, and see b.1. above)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Pesach is only one step away from being Shelamim, whereas an Asham only becomes an Olah through its value, not itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the dispute (between Rebbi and R. Shimon)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Answer: R. Shimon holds that since a female may not be brought as a Pesach, it cannot receive more than Kedushas Damim; whereas Rebbi holds that since the surplus becomes Shelamim, the animal itself receives Kedushas Ha'Guf. [<b>NOTE</b>: <b>FOLLOWING THE GR</b>"A (<b>AS BROUGHT IN THE</b> T.<b>CH</b>.), <b>WE ADVANCE THE DISCUSSION FROM</b> 13A (<b>FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE</b> 6TH <b>LINE UNTIL HALACHAH</b> 5) <b>INTO THE TEXT HERE</b>.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Others citing R. Yochanan):</span> The opinion of R. Shimon b. Yehudah (see 6.c.2. above) is derived from the words Temeiah and ve'He'emid ve'He'erich in Vayikra 27:11 that a female for an Olah receives only Kedushas Damim (not Kedushas Ha'Guf).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira citing R. Elazar):</span> We can garner support for R. Shimon from the Pasuk!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Only that which cannot be offered under any conditions cannot create a Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>An Olah therefore <i>would</i> receive Kedushas ha'Guf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find the Rova and Nirva which cannot be offered under any conditions and yet they create Temurah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> My rule only applies to a Tamei (or otherwise completely precluded) animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would the Torah have instructed the whole procedure of assessment if the animal was entirely precluded?!   [<b>BACK TO</b> 12B]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Zeira citing Resh Lakish):</span> gave the rationale of R. Yehoshua (based on the Pasuk [Vayikra 22:18]) that everything is brought as an Olah, even the females (are sold and brought as Olos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Pasuk says "males" and how is that different than "Tamim" referring even to Ba'alei Mumin!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The difference between them is obvious.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>THE RATIONALE FOR R. ELAZAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Let them (the items fitting for Nesachim) be sold for those who need those items (and the funds are used for Olos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu citing Resh Lakish or R. Yochanan):</span> His rationale is the Pasuk (Vayikra 22:18) that all of his property is brought as Olos (meaning the animals which can serve as Olos) but not the birds (which are sold for Olos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> By the rationale for R. Shimon, R. Yochanan said that females can be included in Olos since birds are brought as Olos, and now you are saying that birds are not brought!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosah):</span> According to my explanation for R. Elazar (as to why the birds do not get Kedushas Ha'Guf) the matter of R. Yochanan will also be understood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">The principle is:</span> Whatever cannot be offered, nor its redemption money offered, can only get Kedushas Damim (hence the Halachah regarding birds).</p></div>
