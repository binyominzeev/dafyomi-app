<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: INTRODUCTION TO SHEKALIM (Yerushalmi Perek 1 Halachah 1 Daf 1a)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>On the first of Adar:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Shekalim were announced.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A warning regarding Kilayim was announced.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>On the fifteenth of Adar:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Megilah was read.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The roads and Mikvaos were repaired (from winter damage).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>General communal needs were arranged and graves were marked.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Agents of Beis Din went out to (destroy remaining) Kilayim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR NISAN AS THE START OF THE SHEKALIM YEAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was this announcement made on the first of Adar?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> So that Bnei Yisrael might bring their Shekalim on time and the purchases made from the Terumas ha'Lishkah would be made from the new donations (on the first of Nisan).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This parallels the date of the first such purchase in the Mishkan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Tavi):</span> This date is derived from a Gezeirah Shavah (Chodshei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yona, questioning R. Tavi):</span> It comes from l'Chodshei ha'Shanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is (or, why) Mashmi'im (let it be heard)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means (or, because of) Machrizim (announce) as in the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>To the Mishnah which lists the differences between Adar I and Adar II, R. Simon adds our laws (the announcements).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Yosi says that this is logically correct, since the announcements on Adar I would be too early.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Then (it would seem that) those living in Bavel should announce earlier owing to their greater distance.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there was no expectation that they bring their Shekalim by Nisan</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We see from the Mishnah that purchases were made from the Lishka three times a year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This implies that those at greater distance were allowed to bring their Shekalim until the third purchase, Sukkos!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All the Shekalim were brought as one (by Nisan), and the Mishna only divided the purchase points to make it public.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE POWERFUL DRIVE OF EVIL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Three instances which show how, when good needed to be done, only the generous came forward, but when evil was in the offing, all came forward.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Prophet Tzefanya also rebuked the people regarding their alacrity in doing evil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The nature of this People is difficult to understand (they just <i>give</i>), as they gave generously to the Calf, as well as to the Mishkan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Actually, the Mishkan was to <i>atone</i> for the Calf.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THREE TERUMOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Pasuk in Parshas Terumah refers to three donations:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Half-Shekel each towards the Adanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Half-Shekel for their Shekalim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Donations for the Mishkan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Each of the donations went to its own purpose:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The donations to the Mishkan were unrestricted donations, with unrestricted use in the Mishkan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Shekalim could only be used for the Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Every Jew's portion had to be equal as well regarding the Shekalim for the Adanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Pasuk in Ki Sisa also refers to the three donations.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>READING THE MEGILA ON THE FOURTEENTH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> It is permitted to read the Megilah on the fourteenth (even for those whose obligation is on the fifteenth).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Pasuk which, apparently, restricts each person to their day only, is coming to teach that on a leap year the Mitzvos are to be performed on Adar II, not Adar I (following the understanding of the Korban ha'Eida).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Our Mishnah which says otherwise must be speaking l'Chatchila, while R. Chelbo was speaking b'di'Eved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But, then, why should there be doubtful cities wherein we read on both days (if b'di'Eved the 14th is acceptable)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, I also disagree with R. Chelbo.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If we would <i>not</i> have those cities read again on the 15th, others would learn an error and the 15th would be uprooted!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>ADAR I AND ADAR II</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Gamliel):</span> All the Mitzvos of Adar only appear on Adar II with the exceptions of fasting and eulogizing which are prohibited in both months.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is Hinhig (the law for those who ask) not Halachah (publicly announced).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>There is a dispute regarding dating contracts on Adar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir holds that Adar II is the assumed Adar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that Adar I is the assumed Adar.</p></div>
