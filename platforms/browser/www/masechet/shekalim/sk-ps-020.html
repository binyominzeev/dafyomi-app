<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav, upon coming to Bavel, ruled stringently regarding meat which was left unsupervised.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>In one case a person left the river into which his meat had fallen and Rav prohibited him from returning and netting it out (lest this is not his original piece of meat).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Similarly in a case where a bird snatched the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>In the cases of bottles and barrels of wine, they could be checked for identifiable seals by the vintners and used.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Roasted meat in the public street of Gufsa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Need not be returned (the owners have forfeited their claim since it is irretrievable, akin to a rushing river).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>May be eaten (since the majority of passersby are Jews).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>In such an incident their ruling was vindicated as the meat turned out to have been from the house of Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Cheese found in the Pundak of Levi was permitted on the same grounds as above (and their ruling was similarly vindicated).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ATTITUDE TOWARDS FOUND ARTICLES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Mana reported to R. Yosi that the Rabbis would announce their find even from a public thoroughfare.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi responded that R. Mana's father, R. Yona, often taught that such a find would enrich him, not needing to be announced.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Nevertheless, R. Yona, when confronted with such a find, did not take it for himself, but rather announced it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HALACHAH 3: THE STATUS OF FOUND ANIMALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>An animal found within a radius of Jerusalem to Migdal Eder, the males are brought as Olos; the females as Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> If the animal is fit as a Korban Pesach then it is brought as a Pesach [if found within 30 days before Pesach].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Originally the finder had to put up collateral guaranteeing that he would bring the Nesachim for the found animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This practice was eliminated and the Nesachim were provided at public expense.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This was the first in a list of seven conditions instituted by Beis Din, as listed.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>BRINGING FOUND MALES AS OLOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Shelamim could also be from males?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The animal is not brought as an Olah, but its value provides for both an Olah and a Shelamim, if the finder wishes to address all of the doubts which surround it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He is Mechalel the money on the animals, like R. Meir (who holds that Hekdesh be'Meizid is Mischalel).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He then brings Olos and Shelamim with the money.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But how can he be Mechalel be'Meizid!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This ability is only according to R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We hold like R. Yehudah who disagrees!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it is a condition of Beis Din it is not considered Meizid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> But this instructs the finder to do Meilah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means that we follow the Rov;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the majority found are male, they are all Olos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the majority are females they are all brought as Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>(R. Zeira) We are not worried about the males among the Shelamim since this, too, is a condition of Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Yasa reported having heard (in Bavel) R. Yehudah ask Shmuel regarding one who separated his Shekalim and died.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Shmuel had taught that Shekalim (in the case where the owner designated the funds and then died) should go to Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Regarding leftover funds from the Minchas Kohen:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The leftover funds must be destroyed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> They go to Nedavah (as leftover Chatas).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE MINCHAH OF THE KOHEN GADOL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Asiris ha'Eifah (which is brought as an Isaron and divided):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> An entire Isaron is brought, divided and then the half is sanctified in a K'li Shares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> It is all sanctified in a K'li Shares and then divided.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah in Menachos (51b) appears to disagree with R. Yochanan (the remaining half is destroyed, indicating that it was already sanctified).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is R. Yochanan's view that leftover funds from the Asiris ha'Eifah must be destroyed (4.j.1. above).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a Beraisa against R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Where the Kohen Gadol died and his replacement brought a (whole) Minchah from his home, two halves are offered and two halves are destroyed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The remaining half from the first (deceased) Kohen is destroyed along with the remaining half of the incoming Kohen, after waiting for it to become invalidated.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Why, according to R. Yochanan, should we have to wait?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a dispute over whether the utensil for the Isaron sanctifies it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE INAUGURAL MINCHAH FOR A KOHEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>All Kohanim bring a Minchas Chavitin before performing their Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a new Kohen was also becoming the Kohen Gadol, he brings two, one as a new Kohen, and one as the daily obligation of the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Tufinei (Vayikra 6:14) - Bake the Minchah only when it may be brought (on the same day).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we learn that it was done a day earlier!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was not the baking, it was heating the water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yasa):</span> Tufinei - deep fried then baked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Acha):</span> Baked then deep fried.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> Tufinei - Bake it "Na" or not completely (but somewhat) cooked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> Bake it "Na'eh" (don't fry it first).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Dosa):</span> Bake it more than once (before <i>and</i> after).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>The above interpretations of Tufinei are the bases for the dispute over baking/frying first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>The laws taught here apply not only if the first Kohen died, but also if he became Tamei, or developed a blemish.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>WHO PAYS FOR THE MINCHAS CHAVITIN OF A DECEASED KOHEN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The inheritors.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>They must bring a complete Isaron (undivided).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> It is a communal expense (as indicated by the words "Chok Olam."</p></div>
