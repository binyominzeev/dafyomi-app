<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: DEALING WITH THE SURPLUS CHANGE WHICH A PERSON COLLECTED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One who saves coins for his Shekel and discovers that he has designated more than he needs for the Shekel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Beis Shamai):The surplus is Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> The surplus is Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he specifically indicated that <i>from</i> these coins he will bring the Shekel, then all agree that the surplus is Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If the designation was "these will be for my Chatas" then all agree that the balance becomes Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Again, if it was <i>from</i> these, then the balance is Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimon):</span> What is the difference between Shekalim and Chatas?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shekalim has a set limit, whereas Chatas does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Shekalim also has no limit.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Upon their return from Bavel B'nei Yisrael used Darkonim as the Shekel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Subsequently they went back to Sela'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Subsequently they went to Tiv'in.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>They wanted to give Dinarim (half-Tiv'in but less than the value of a half-Shekel).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>They did not accept this (reduced value).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> Still, everyone gave an equal amount (unlike by Chatas which may vary from person to person).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A COLLECTION OF PERUTOS OR A HANDFUL OF COINS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> The dispute in the Mishnah is over a collection of Perutos (and he has lost track of how many he has).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If, however, he took a sum of money and designated it, the balance is certainly Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya and R. Bibi):</span> If he took a sum, the balance is <i>Chulin</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> Our Mishnah supports R. Bibi (since the distinction made by R. Shimon can only be seen according to R. Bibi).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will R. Yosi do with this indication.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The distinction made by R. Shimon is found only within Beis Hillel when the person collected Perutos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah later teaches that the balance is Chulin (when will this be so)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The same answer as (f).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ERRORS IN DESIGNATION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One who designated money but is exempt from giving a shekel, such funds are clearly Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he designated two and later found out that he only owes one half-Shekel (what becomes of the second)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may infer the answer from the same case regarding Chatas where the Beraisa teaches that the second Chatas ends up being Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Halachah here will follow the Din by "these coins are for my Shekalim."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>CHANGES IN THE LOCAL CURRENCY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>As we learned in our Mishnah, as the currency changed, they would give the half of that currency, but not less than the value of a half-Shekel (as indicated by the Pasuk in Nechemyah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The larger coins were used in the time of Nechemyah, a <i>third</i> of which equaled the half-Shekel of the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>ALLUSIONS IN THE PASUK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We learn from here that a person must give Tzedakah three times yearly.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We also learn that more than three annual Tzedakah campaigns is a burden for the community.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This is the source for three Sela'im, three Kupos and three donations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The Pasuk alludes to the fact that B'nei Yisrael sinned at midday (hence the <i>half</i> coin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nechemyah):</span> The Pasuk requires a half-Shekel which is made of six Garmesin, because their sin took place at the sixth hour.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The coin had the weight of 10 Gera, owing to their violation of the ten commandments.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Because Rachel's firstborn (Yosef) was sold for 20 Kesef, let every firstborn be redeemed for that amount (20 Dinarim = five Sela'im).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Each brother ended up with one Tiv'a, therefore the annual donation must be a Shekel worth a Tiv'a.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MISHNAH: OTHER EXTRAS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The surplus Shekalim are Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The surplus tenth of an Eifah (poorest offering) as well as the other offerings listed are Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>As a rule, leftover of any "deficit" offering is Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Olah, Mincha, Shelamim, Pesach, Nezirim their surplus is like themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The surplus of a Nazir goes to Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>SURPLUS COINS, SURPLUS EIFAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What if one set aside his Shekel and then died?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are placed in the box of Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The surplus from the tenth of an Eifah of the Kohen Gadol:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan holds it is thrown into the Dead Sea.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar says that they go to Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah (6.b. above) goes against R. Yochanan!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is speaking of the surplus from a Yisrael (Minchas Chotei), not of the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>SURPLUS PESACH BECOMING A SHELAMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that (surplus) Pesach can be Shelamim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk [Min ha'Tzon... l'Zevach Shelamim] implies that any Korban which comes from Tzon can be brought as Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But an Olah <i>also</i> comes from Tzon!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk speaks of Korbanos which <i>exclusively</i> come from Tzon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But an Asham <i>only</i> comes from Tzon!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk speaks of Korbanos which can come from <i>any</i> Tzon (including Izim), not only from Kevasim and Aylim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Min" normally excludes, yet here it includes?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here, too, it excludes (over one year old or a female).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Pasuk [Min ha'Tzon... l'Olah] can be understood to mean that the surplus Pesach is brought as an Olah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Compare edible Korbanos with edible Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It makes more sense to switch Kodeshim Kalim to a different Kodeshim Kalim, and not to Kodshei Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>THE STATUS OF THE PESACH IN THE FACE OF LISHMAH ERRORS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A Pesach switches to a Shelamim not only if it were slaughtered to be a Shelamim, but even if it were slaughtered as an Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yochanan's rationale?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk implies that all forms of Korbanos revert to Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about an invalidating thought regarding an Olah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the invalidation is universal (such as Chutz li'Zemano) then it will certainly invalidate here!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Pigul only applies if there is no other invalidation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If the thought of an Olah renders it Pasul, then it will not become Pigul (and conversely).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What of a Pesach slaughtered (throughout the year) with both Lishmah and she'Lo Lishmah thoughts?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Kosher (given the power of Lishmah to overcome the absence of any thought).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the "good" thought is so powerful then it should even address a Pesach slaughtered Lishmah with intent to do the Zerikah she'Lo Lishmah, by neutralizing the intent!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shetikah, per se, does not make it Kosher, unless he has undone the Lishmah of the Shechitah.</p></div>
