<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HALACHAH 4: MISHNAH: ACCEPTING GIFTS FROM THOSE NOT OBLIGATED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We accept the half-Shekel from women, Avadim and minors.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We do not accept the half-Shekel from Kusim and non-Jews.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>As a rule, voluntary offerings are accepted from non-Jews, but not obligatory offerings (as taught by Ezra).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The extra "Kalbon" is given by the general population but not by those from whom we do not take security for their Shekel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>One who lends another their Shekel need not add a Kalbon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>One who gives a Shekel, half of which is a loan for another, must add only one Kalbon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> He adds two Kalbonos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>One who gets a Shekel change must give two Kalbonos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>One who gives on behalf of another is exempt from the Kalbon if it is a gift, and obligated if it is a loan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>When brothers are obligated in Ma'aser Beheimah, they are exempt from the Kalbon, and when they are exempt from Ma'aser Beheimah, they are obligated in the Kalbon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>A Kalbon is a Ma'ah of silver (1/24 of a Selah or 16 Seorim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachachim):</span> It is half a Ma'ah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DEMANDING FROM A MINOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Here we infer that we do not demand the Shekel from minors, yet in the previous Mishnah we learned that we do not take security from them, but we <i>do</i> demand the half-Shekel!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The difference is a minor who does/does not show signs of puberty.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>GENTILES AND KUSIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Our Mishnah follows the opinion of Rebbi (in a dispute between Rebbi and R. Shimon b. Gamliel) that Kusim are like Gentiles.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> Our Mishnah is speaking about Gentiles (when it speaks of not accepting their offerings), and it may hold that Kusim are considered as Jews (a Beraisa seems to support this).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Our Mishnah which teaches not to accept Kinin of Zavin and Zavos is a contradiction to R. Elazer, since there is no such Tumah by Gentiles!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Reisha speaks of non-Jews and the Seifa speaks of Kusim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SPECIFIC AND NON-SPECIFIC GIFTS OF NON-JEWS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> At the outset we did not accept specific gifts for Bedek ha'Bayis nor general gifts from non-Jews, whereas later we accepted only general gifts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> We do not accept anything from non-Jews.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa argues with R. Yochanan (implying that we do not take anything from the non-Jews, apparently at any time).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa speaks of specific gifts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Beraisa is only speaking at the offset.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Mishnah is a challenge to Reish Lakish (teaching that non-Jews may offer another person's worth).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Mishnah means that we accept an Olah from him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah speaks of <i>Nidarin</i> which cannot speak of an Olah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means Nidarin when he accepts a Jew's Neder upon himself (or the reverse - Taklin Chadetin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (on Reish Lakish):</span> If a non-Jew can bring Nesachim, then he must be able to donate a Kli Shares (a specific gift), as well (for the surplus)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As in the Mishnah (which would be problematic even according to R. Yochanan since it permits specific gifts), the gift intended for Shamayim goes to Bedek ha'Bayis. (Taklin Chadetin)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Reish Lakish based his opinion on the fact that the Pasuk in Ezra seems to prohibit all forms of non-Jewish participation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>It would appear from the Pasuk in Nechemyah that we do not even accept donations from non-Jews for local infrastructure (cisterns, walls, towers, etc.).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>GIVING THE KALBON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Our Mishnah (which obligates all donors to give a Kalbon) is R. Meir (who holds that the Kalbon is obligatory upon all).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his source for the addition?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To compensate for impurities, to make it identical (ka'Zeh) to the celestial coin of fire.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Mishnah which obligates one who receives a Shekel change to give two Kalbonos is the opinion of R. Meir (This opinion is indicated in the Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This requirement to give two Kalbonos is according to all opinions (one Kalbon for bringing a non-standard coin, and one for getting change).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>According to Rav, R. Meir would require <i>three</i> Kalbonos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This was, indeed, explicit in a citation of Rav.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>BROTHERS AND PARTNERS GIVING MA'ASER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>They are obligated in Kalbon and exempt from Ma'aser in the case where they split up (the inheritance) and re-joined as partners.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The reverse would be the case if they did not divide.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> A split is only when they divided the assets by valuation (not just numerically) [Yesh Bereirah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even a numerical split is considered a division [Ein Bereirah] and a purchaser (or one who receives a gift) is exempt from Ma'aser Beheimah.</p></div>
