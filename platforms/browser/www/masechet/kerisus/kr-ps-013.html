<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> (He is liable) only if the total delay was bi'Chdei Achilas Pras.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If R. Meir is stringent, we understand why Chachamim say '<i>only</i> (if he ate bi'Chdei Achilas Pras)';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>if R. Meir is lenient, they should say (he is liable) '<i>if</i> he ate... '!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> R. Meir is stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Ravnoi):</span> (One is liable for eating) Chelev or Nevelah only if he ate bi'Chdei Achilas Pras;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(One becomes Tamei through eating a Shi'ur of) Tamei foods, Shekatzim u'Remasim and Tamei drinks, even the entire day, bi'Chdei Achilas Pras.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> (He becomes Tamei) even if he ate over the course of the entire day, on condition that each k'Zayis was bi'Chdei Achilas Pras.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> All food joins to the Shi'ur of a half-Pras to be Metamei a person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is only if he ate a half-Pras bi'Chdei Achilas Pras.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, each k'Zayis was eaten bi'Chdei Achilas Pras.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> All food joins to a half-Pras to be Metamei a person if eaten bi'Chdei Achilas Pras;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one ate intermittently, he becomes Tamei only if he finished bi'Chdei Achilas Pras of when he began.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim did not permit one to eat less than a Shi'ur and immerse. If after doing so, he completed the Shi'ur, it joins to be Metamei him (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They permitted a pregnant woman to eat a partial Shi'ur due to danger (to the fetus if she does not taste a food that she smelled and desires).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>All (Tamei) drinks join to the Shi'ur of a Revi'is to be Metamei one who drinks them bi'Chdei Achilas Pras;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If one drank intermittently, he becomes Tamei only if he finished bi'Chdei Achilas Pras of when he began.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Chachamim permitted a woman who touched a person who is Tamei Mes (she is a Rishon l'Tum'ah) to nurse a baby, and the baby remains Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> It says that he becomes Tamei only if he finished bi'Chdei Achilas Pras of when he began. Ravnoi is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LENIENCIES REGARDING <i>TUM'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They did not permit a person to eat less than a Shi'ur and immerse...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They did not permit one who ate less than a Shi'ur to immerse, for if he will finish the Shi'ur after immersing, he might think that the immersion helped;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is wrong. It helps only if it was at the end.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They permitted a pregnant woman to eat a partial Shi'ur due to danger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there is danger, she should be allowed to eat more!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It means, they permitted a pregnant woman to eat a partial Shi'ur or even more due to danger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They permitted a woman who touched a Tamei Mes to nurse, and the baby remains Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the baby Tahor? He ingested Tamei milk. This should be Metamei him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the milk was not Huchshar to be Mekabel  Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely, it is Huchshar through a dirty drop remaining on the nipple! (The baby will not eat it, so it is considered a Mashkeh,and not food.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> The case is, the baby nursed in one sucking (vigorously). It did not leave a drop on the nipple.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rava):</span> (Sometimes) we see that his mouth is full of milk! (He does not nurse vigorously. A drop remains.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rava):</span> The source of milk is a Mayan! (If she is Tamei, it is Tamei without Hechsher.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> Human milk is Tamei whether it came out l'Ratzon (willingly) or Lo l'Ratzon. An animal's milk is Tamei only if it came out l'Ratzon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Lo l'Ratzon means, the baby (Rashi; Shitah - mother) does not want it, yet it is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, the baby is Tahor because of a Sefek Sefeika (two doubts):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps he did not ingest a Shi'ur of milk. And even if he did, perhaps this was not bi'Chdei Achilas Pras!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rava really hold that the source of milk is a Mayan, so it does not need Hechsher?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2):</span> If milk dripped from a (Nidah's) breast into an oven, the oven is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was Machshir the milk?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It was Huchshar through a dirty drop remaining on the nipple.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Rava argues with R. Yochanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely he agrees with him. A Beraisa supports him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are nine Mashkim of Zavim (and Zavos) - sweat, pus and excrement are totally Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Tears, blood of a wound and milk have Tum'as Mashkim;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Any amount of spit, Zivah and urine are Avos ha'Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If milk were a Mayan, it would also be an Av ha'Tum'ah, like spit and Zivah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Surely, he agrees that milk is not a Mayan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Mishnah #2 and the Beraisa contradict Mishnah #1!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo l'Ratzon" (in Mishnah #1) does not mean (like we assumed) that it is unwanted. Rather, (it means without expressed desire;) since most babies like milk, we assume that it is l'Ratzon (Shitah - of the mother);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we clearly see that (s)he does not want it, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one ate Tamei food... (or drank... and entered the Mikdash - if the delay was... )</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it discuss the delay? One is liable for entering (the Mikdash while Tamei or drunk) even without any delay! (Tosfos explains that he is liable only if he did Avodah, i.e. for entering while drunk. It seems that he holds like Rashi on the Mishnah (12b), that the Chiyuv for entering the Mikdash applies only to drinking wine.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It means, if one ate Tamei food, drank Tamei liquids, or drank a Revi'is of wine, if this was bi'Chdei Achilas Pras, if he then entered the Mikdash, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SHTUYEI YAYIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Yayin v'Shechar Al Tesht" obligates for (entering the Mikdash (and doing Avodah) after) drinking any amount of wine, or wine mi'Gito (unfermented grape juice)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Shechar" teaches that it is Meshaker (intoxicates).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What intoxicates?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Revi'is of wine pressed at least 40 days ago intoxicates.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "Yayin"? (This connotes even if it does not intoxicate!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This forbids entering the Mikdash after drinking any amount, even mi'Gito.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, "Yayin" forbids only wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to forbid other intoxicants?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Shechar" includes them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If all intoxicants are forbidden, why does it say "Yayin"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is Chayav Misah (b'Yedei Shamayim) for wine, but not for other intoxicants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Elazar expounds (as if it said) "Yayin Al Tesht; v'Shechar Al Tesht" - do not drink in an intoxicating way;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he paused while drinking, or added any amount of water, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana learns a Gezeirah Shavah "Shechar-Shechar" from Nazir (that only wine is forbidden). R. Yehudah does not learn the Gezeirah Shavah. R. Elazar holds that Shechar connotes something that intoxicates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one ate a date of Ke'ilah, drank honey (cooked with water) or milk and entered the Mikdash and served, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Achosai citing Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> R. Elazar is exceedingly sharp.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Acha of Hutzal had vowed not to benefit from his wife. He came to Rav Ashi (on Yom Tov) to permit it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Go, and return tomorrow. Rav would not expound on Yom Tov (after drinking) until the next day, lest he be drunk. (Similarly, I do not permit vows on Yom Tov.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Acha:</span> Rav ruled that the Halachah follows R. Elazar, and you mix your wine with water!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> R. Elazar exempts only when he drank exactly a Revi'is (of diluted wine). I drank more than a Revi'is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (After the Isur to enter the Mikdash when drunk, it says) "u'Lehavdil Bein ha'Kodesh u'Vein ha'Chol" refers to Damim (vows to give one's or thing's value to Hekdesh), Erchin, Charamim and Hekdeshos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"U'Vein ha'Tamei u'Vein ha'Tahor" refers to Teme'os and Taharos. "U'Lehoros" is ruling (on Isur v'Heter). "Es Kol ha'Chukim" arewhat is expounded. "Asher Diber Hash-m" are traditions from Moshe from Sinai. "B'Yad Moshe" is Talmud (which explains everything else. Maharsha - "Asher Diber Hash-m" is Talmud, and "b'Yad Moshe" is Halachah l'Moshe mi'Sinai.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps also Mishnah (may not be taught while drunk)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "u'Lehoros" (one may not rule based on Mishnah alone).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, one might have thought that even Talmud (may not be taught while drunk). "U'Lehoros" teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who is drunk may rule that a Sheretz is Tamei and that a frog is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah. It is unlike Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, even Chachamim permit this, for anyone who knows Chumash knows this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav wouldn't expound on Yom Tov (after the Seudah) until the next day (because he drank. R. Yosi forbids only Hora'ah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav would give Hora'ah when he expounded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he expound without giving Hora'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He could not avoid it (Rashi - people would always ask questions. Rambam - people learn Halachos from whatever he teaches.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One can be liable four Chata'os and one Asham for one eating, e.g. if a Tamei person ate Chelev that was Nosar of Kodshim on Yom Kipur;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> If it was Shabbos he can be liable also for Hotza'ah (transferring from Reshus ha'Yachid to Reshus ha'Rabim, if he walked outside with the food in his mouth)!</p>
