<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OVERLAPPING <i>NEZIRUYOS</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rava ask about accepting a short (i.e. 30 day) Nezirus (after having accepted Nezirus after 20 days? Perhaps he begins the latter immediately, interrupts for the first Nezirus, and does not shave until finishing the last 10 days of the latter Nezirus?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In truth, first he asked about a short Nezirus, and then about a 100 day Nezirus:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If you will say regarding a short Nezirus, that since only 10 days remain, they cannot join with the first 20 (so he did not want the Nezirus to start within the 20 days), perhaps when he accepted 100 days, since 80 days remain, they join to the first 20;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps even in this case he does not want to interrupt the Nezirus?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If you will say that he starts right away, if he accepted Nezirus after 20 days, and to be a Nazir Olam right away, does the latter take effect right away? (Perhaps here we do not say so, for Nezirus Olam is a different kind of Nezirus, and it is an interruption.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If you will say that it does, since the Nezirus after 20 days can be annulled (by a Chacham) through regret, if he accepted Nezirus Shimshon after 20 days, and to be a Nazir right away, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nezirus Shimshon cannot be annulled. Does the (regular) Nezirus take effect?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> If one said 'I am like Moshe on the seventh of Adar' is he a Nazir? (Perhaps he refers to the die Moshe died, when many Yisraelim accepted Nezirus due to grief. Or, he refers to the day Moshe was born, a day of Simchah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Question #1, 13b - Beraisa):</span> If one said 'I will be a Nazir after 20 days, and I am a Nazir from now for 100 days', he counts 20 days (of the long Nezirus), then 30 days of Nezirus, then completes 80 days (of the long Nezirus).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>TUM'AH</i> DURING THE MIDDLE <i>NEZIRUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If (in this case of the Mishnah) he became Tamei while counting the Nezirus of his son, this also nullifies the days he counted towards his own Nezirus;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The days he counted towards his own Nezirus stand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yochanan says that all the days are Batel, because they are like one long Nezirus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reish Lakish says the first days are not Batel, because it is like a separate Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a Nazir became a Metzora Muchlat (he brought a Siman of absolute Tum'ah), and became Tamei Mes during this time, this cancels the days of Nezirus that he counted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The days are not Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yochanan says that they are Batel, because he is in the midst of Nezirus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reish Lakish says they are not Batel, because the period of being a (Metzora) Muchlat is distinct from the Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>They needed to argue in both cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had they argued only about two Neziruyos, one might have thought that there R. Yochanan says all the days are Batel, since they are like one Nezirus, but he would agree with Reish Lakish that the days of Muchlat are distinct from the Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had they argued only about a Muchlat, one might have thought that there Reish Lakish says that the days stand, but he agrees with R. Yochanan about two Neziruyos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>TUM'AH</i> AFTER THE TERM OF <i>NEZIRUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a Nazir became Tamei on a day of growing his hair (he finished the Nezirus he accepted, but his hair was cut in the middle b'Ones, and he cannot shave until he has 30 days growth of hair), this does not nullify the days he counted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even R. Yochanan said that Tum'ah nullifies what he counted, only when he is in the midst of Nezirus. Here, he finished his Nezirus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This nullifies the days he counted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even Reish Lakish said that Tum'ah does not nullify the previous days, only when the previous days were a separate Nezirus. Here, it is all one Nezirus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> All agree that if he became Tamei after bringing the Korbanos but before shaving, he has no solution.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to whom is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is according to R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He holds that the Isurim of a Nazir are in effect until he shaves. It is as if he became Tamei within the term (and he has a solution, like any Nazir Tamei)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> It must be according to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Chachamim say that Isurei Nezirus go away even if he does not shave!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is like Chachamim. He has no solution to perform he Mitzvah of shaving properly (in Taharah, with the Korbanos).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A <i>NAZIR</i> AFTER THE TERM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi  b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> A Nazir who finished his term (and is ready to bring Korbanos) is lashed if he becomes Tamei, but not for shaving or drinking wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Tum'ah different?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It says "all the days (...he will not become Tamei)" to include the days after the term.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Also regarding shaving and drinking wine, it says "all the days"!</p>
