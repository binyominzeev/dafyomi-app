<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ACCEPTING <i>NEZIRUS</i> WHILE <i>TAMEI</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he left and returned (after becoming Tahor and accepting Nezirus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The only difference between a Tamei who accepted Nezirus and a Tahor Nazir who became Tamei, is that the former counts the seventh day of becoming Tahor towards the term of Nezirus, but the latter does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Nezirus does not take effect (unless he accepts Nezirus again), why does day seven count?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> All agree that it takes effect. They argue about lashes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan holds that since it takes effect, he is lashed (if he transgresses).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish holds that even though it takes effect, he is not lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven accepted Nezirus in a cemetery, even if he stayed there 30 days, they do not count. He does not bring Korbanos Nazir Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> he does not bring the Korbanos, but he is lashed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, the Mishnah should say that he is not lashed. Since the Seifa says 'if he left (and became Tahor) and returned to the cemetery, the days are counted, and he brings Korbanos Nazir Tamei", the Reisha said that he does not bring Korbanos Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The only difference between a Tamei who accepted Nezirus and a Tahor Nazir who became Tamei, is that the former counts the seventh day of becoming Tahor towards the term of Nezirus, but the latter does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> There is no difference regarding lashes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, they are the same regarding shaving (when they finish Nezirus and bring Korbanos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If the latter is lashed, but not the former, the Beraisa should teach this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa teaches only matters of fixing the Nazir, not transgressions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Tamei accepted Nezirus, he may not shave, drink wine, or become Tamei. If he did any of these, he receives 40 lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This refutes Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS ONE LASHED WITHOUT DELAYING?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one accepted Nezirus while in a cemetery, must he delay there (the time needed to bow) to be lashed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He was warned not to accept Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he is lashed even if he does not delay, just like a Tahor Nazir who was warned not to become Tamei is lashed, even without delay!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he entered the cemetery in a chest (that shields from Tum'ah). Someone else removed the bottom, making him (tower over a grave and become) Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>There is a tradition (from Sinai) that a Tamei in the Beis ha'Mikdash is lashed only if he delays. Does the tradition apply only inside the Mikdash, or even outside?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHICH <i>TAMEI</i> <i>NEZIRIM</i> MUST SHAVE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If one accepted Nezirus while in a cemetery, does he need to shave (immediately when he becomes Tahor)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps only a Tahor Nazir who became Tamei needs to shave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps there is no distinction!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven accepted Nezirus in a cemetery, even if he stayed there 30 days, they do not count. He does not bring Korbanos Nazir Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He need not bring the Korbanos, but he must shave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Mishnah means that he does not bring the Korbanos because he does not shave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> The only difference between a Tamei who accepted Nezirus and a Tahor Nazir who became Tamei, is that the former counts the seventh day of becoming Tahor towards the term of Nezirus, but the latter does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They are the same regarding shaving (i.e. both shave)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they are the same regarding lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they are different regarding shaving, the Beraisa should teach this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This follows from what was taught, that that the seventh day counts for the former and not for the latter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa) Question:</span> It is clear that days of Tum'ah (Tum'as Mes) do not count towards Nezirus. What is the source that also days when he is a Metzora Muchlat do not count?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A Metzora Muchlat shaves and brings a Korban, just like a Tamei Nazir. Likewise, just like days of a Tamei Nazir do not count, also days of a Metzora Muchlat do not count!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn thusly.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Days of a Tamei Nazir do not count, because he nullifies the previous count. A Metzora Muchlat does not nullify the previous count. (Perhaps) his days count!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from a Kal v'Chomer.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If one accepted Nezirus in a cemetery, his hair is destined to be shaved, yet the days of Tum'ah do not count. The hair of a Metzora Muchlat is not destined to be shaved, all the more so his days do not count!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The former is destined to shave like a Tamei Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he will shave like a Tahor Nazir (after fulfilling the count).</p>
