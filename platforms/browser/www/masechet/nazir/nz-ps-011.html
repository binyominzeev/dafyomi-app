<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>NEZIRUS</i> FROM ONE CUP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they mixed a cup of wine for a man and he said 'I am a Nazir from it', he is a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A case occurred in which a woman was drunk. They mixed a cup of wine for her. She said 'I am a Nazir from it', Chachamim said that she intended only to forbid that cup with a vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The case contradicts the law taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Reisha says that he is a Nazir. In the episode, she may not drink that cup, but she may drink others!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means, if 'they mixed a cup of wine for a man and he said 'I am a Nazir from it', he is a Nazir. If he was drunk, he is not a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The reason is, it is as if he forbade that cup like a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If so, he should have said so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He reasoned, if I forbid just that cup, they will bring to me another and annoy me. Rather, I will say something that will cause them to desist.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A case occurred in which a woman...</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO DOES NOT WANT TO OBSERVE ALL <i>ISURIM</i> OF A <i>NAZIR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir on condition that I can drink wine and become Tamei', he is a Nazir, with all the Isurim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'I knew about Nezirus, but I did not know that a Nazir is forbidden to drink wine', he is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one said 'I knew that a Nazir may not drink wine, but I thought that Chachamim will permit me because I cannot live without wine', or 'because I bury the dead', he is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon says, he is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> R. Shimon should argue also in the Reisha!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Indeed, he also argues in the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> He does not argue, because the man stipulates contrary to Torah, and such a stipulation is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehoshua ben Levi holds that when he said 'on condition', he delimits what he accepts (as opposed to accepting Nezirus and stipulating that he will have a leniency).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Ravina - Beraisa):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir on condition that I can drink wine and become Tamei', he is a Nazir, with all the Isurim, because he stipulated contrary to Torah, and such a stipulation is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I knew that a Nazir is forbidden to drink wine...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Reisha, Chachamim forbid, and R. Shimon permits!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The opinions should be switched. Chachamim forbid, and R. Shimon permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We need not switch the opinions:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Reisha, he did not accept all Isurei Nazir. Chachamim say that acceptance of one Isur suffices to make him a full Nazir. R. Shimon permits, unless he accepts all Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the Seifa, he accepted all the Isurim, and seeks to permit one of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to Chachamim, just like acceptance of one Isur makes him a full Nazir, annulment of one Isur permits him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>According to R. Shimon, just like he is not a full Nazir unless he accepts all Isurim, he is forbidden unless he permits all the Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Tana'im argue about Nidrei Ones (he did not vow with this intent) like Rav Asi and Shmuel argue:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chachamim permitted four categories of vows: vows of urging, of exaggeration, b'Shogeg; and b'Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> One who took one of these vows must ask a Chacham to annul it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Shmuel):</span> It says that Chachamim permitted these vows. You cannot say that one must ask a Chacham!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim hold like Shmuel (he is permitted immediately), and R. Shimon holds like Rav Asi (he is forbidden until he asks a Chacham).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO ACCEPTS <i>NEZIRUS</i> AND TO BRING A <i>NAZIR'S</i> <i>KORBANOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven said 'I am a Nazir, and it is Alai to be Megale'ach (bring Korbanos for a Nazir.' Shimon heard this, and said 'I also, and it is Alai to be Megale'ach a Nazir.' If they are clever, each is Megale'ach the other. If not, each must be Megale'ach another Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If Shimon heard and said 'I also', does this refer to both things Reuven said, or on just one?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it only refers to one, does it refer to the first, or to the second?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I also, and it is Alai to be Megale'ach a Nazir.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He needed to say 'and it is Alai...' in addition to 'I also.' This shows that 'I also' refers only to one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does it refer to the first or the second?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he needed to repeat the second matter, 'I also' refers to the first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Perhaps it refers to both. 'And it is Alai' merely clarifies what he accepted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (for rejection - Seifa (12b)):</span> If one said 'it is Alai to be Megale'ach a half-Nazir', and Shimon heard this, and said 'I also, it is Alai to be Megale'ach a half-Nazir,..'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon only heard one matter. Clearly, 'it is Alai' merely clarifies what he accepted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If 'I also' always refers only to one matter, we understand the Mishnayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Our Mishnah must teach 'and it is Alai' (without this, Shimon accepted only Nezirus). The next Mishnah repeats 'and it is Alai' for parallel structure.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if 'I also' refers to both, there was no need to teach 'and it is Alai', in either Mishnah!</p>
