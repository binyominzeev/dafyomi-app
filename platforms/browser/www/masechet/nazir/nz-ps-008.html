<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ACCEPTANCE OF MULTIPLE <i>NEZIRUYOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir like the hair on my head', 'like the dirt of the ground', or 'like the sand of the sea', he is a Nazir Olam, and shaves once every 30 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rebbi says, he does not shave every 30 days. Rather, one who says 'are Alai Neziruyos like the hair on my head', 'like the dirt of the ground', or 'like the sand of the sea,' shaves every 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one said 'I am a Nazir this house-full', or 'this box-full', we ask him what he meant:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he says that he accepted one long Nezirus, he is a Nazir for 30 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he had no specific intent, we view the box as if it was full of mustard seeds, and he is a Nazir all his days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one said 'I am a Nazir from here until the place Ploni', we estimate how many days journey this is:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is less than 30 days, he is a Nazir for 30 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is more than 30 days, he is a Nazir like the amount of days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If one said 'I am a Nazir like the number of days in a solar year', he is a Nazir 365 times.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, a case occurred in which a man did this. When he finished, he died.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHY ARE WE STRINGENT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why do we view the box as being full of mustard, and say that he is a Nazir all his life? Why don't we say that it is full of gourds? (Presumably this refers to squash, which are bigger than watermelons.) If so, eventually he will become permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Chizkiyah):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Shimon. R. Yehudah argues:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir on condition that this stack is at least 100 Kor'; and the stack was lost or stolen before he was able to measure it, he is forbidden (all Isurei Nezirus), for one must be stringent about Safek Nezirus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah permits, for we are lenient about Safek Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yochanan):</span> Our Mishnah can even be like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah is lenient in the Beraisa, because we are unsure if he became a Nazir at all. In our Mishnah, he definitely became a Nazir. How can we end the Nezirus? (Shitah Mekubetzes - this is like Tzara'as, in which we are lenient about a Safek before we know that he became Tamei, and stringent afterwards.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can end it by viewing the box as if it is full of gourds! (After this number of Neziruyos, perhaps he need not be a Nazir (again). We are lenient about such a Safek!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Do not think that he accepted multiple Neziruyos upon himself. R. Yehudah holds like Rebbi:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Rebbi):</span> He does not shave every 30 days. Rather, one who says 'are Alai Neziruyos like the hair on my head', 'like the dirt of the ground', or 'like the sand of the sea,' shaves every 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> R. Yehudah does not hold like Rebbi!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir like the number of days in a solar year', (he is a Nazir 365 times). R. Yehudah says, a case occurred in which a man did this. When he finished, he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This fits well if R. Yehudah holds that he accepted many Neziruyos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If R. Yehudah held like Rebbi, that he only accepted one Nezirus, would he say that he finished? (Tosfos - this connotes that he agrees with the first Tana, who says that he is a Nazir 365 times. Rashi - if he held like Rebbi, each of these Neziruyos would be 365 days. In the days of R. Yehudah, no one lived 365 years!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Also the following shows that he does not hold like Rebbi!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir like the number of figs piled up in summer', or 'like the number of sheaves (on the field) in Shemitah', he is a Nazir this many times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> When he says 'the number of', he accepts multiple terms.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi holds that saying 'the number of' makes no difference!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir like the number of days in the solar year', he is a Nazir 365 times. If he said 'like the days of the moon', he is a Nazir that many times;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says, he accepts multiple terms only if he says 'are Alai Neziruyos like the number of days of the sun or moon,'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah holds like Rebbi when he does not say 'the number of.' In such a case, if he did not say 'are Alai Neziruyos', he is only a Nazir once.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about one who says 'the number of.' R. Yehudah says, he accepts multiple terms. Rebbi says, he accepts only one.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MULTIPLE TERMS OF <i>NEZIRUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir all the days of my life' or 'I am a Nazir Olam', he is a Nazir Olam;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Even if he said 100 or 1000 years, he is not a Nazir Olam, rather an eternal Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir and one', he is a Nazir twice. If he continued 'and more', he is a Nazir three times. If he continued 'and further', he is a Nazir four times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that 'and further' adds on as many terms as he already accepted, and he is a Nazir six times. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Sumchus):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir...' and concluded 'Hen', he is a Nazir once. If he concluded 'Digun', 'Trigun', 'Tatrigun', or 'Penitgun', he is a Nazir two, three, four or five times, respectively.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A round house, or one with two, three or five walls cannot receive Tzara'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Kiros" twice (superfluously). Each teaches about two walls, so we learn that the house must have exactly four.</p>
