<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>STAM</i> MONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The law of Stam money is a tradition from Sinai regarding a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It applies also to other matters!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (A Ken is a pair of birds. One will be offered for a Chatas, and the other for an Olah. Oleh v'Yored is a Chatas in which rich people bring animals, and an Ani brings birds.) If one who must bring a Ken (for Oleh v'Yored) designated money for it, he may use all the money for Chatas Beheimah (an animal) if he wants, or all for Olas Beheimah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he died, leaving Stam money (he did not specify how much is for the Chatas), it goes to Nedavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The law applies to Nazir and those who must bring Kinim, for they are similar (they must bring a Chatas and an Olah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan said "regarding a Nazir" to exclude the following.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven was obligated to bring a Chatas and he vowed to bring an Olah, and he separated money and said 'this is for my obligation', he may not use all the money for an animal for the Chatas or Olah ('my obligation' connotes all that he must bring);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he died, leaving Stam money (for the Korbanos), we cast it into the Dead Sea. (Since the Chatas and Olah are not brought for the same matter, the tradition does not apply.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> When we say (in Mishnayos) that specified money does not go to Nedavah, this is not only if he said 'this will be for the Chatas, this for the Olah, and this for the Shelamim.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, even if he said 'this is for my Chatas, Olah and Shelamim', this is considered specified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> (Money is considered specified) not only if he said 'this will be for the Chatas, Olah, and Shelamim';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, even if he said 'this is for my obligation', this is considered specified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Stam money goes to Nedavah (if the man dies), but if the Demei Chatas were separated off, the money is considered specified. (We use half the rest for Olah, and half for Shelamim.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven said 'this money is for my Chatas. The rest is for my other Korbanos Nazir (and he died), the Demei Chatas goes to the Dead Sea. Half the remaining money is used for an Olah, and the other half for a Shelamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he used all the remaining money, he transgressed Me'ilah (some of it was Demei Olah). If he used part of it, he did not transgress Me'ilah (perhaps it was Demei Shelamim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If he said 'this money is for my Olah. The rest is for my other Korbanos Nazir (and he died) - the Demei Olah is used for an Olah. If one benefited from it, he transgressed Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The remaining money goes to Nedavah. One who benefits from the remaining money transgresses Me'ilah (if he uses all of it, but not if he used only part - the Gra deletes this from the text).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED <i>STAM</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The law of Stam applies only to money. If he designated animals, they are considered specified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Only Tam (unblemished) animals are considered specified. Ba'alei Mumim (blemished animals) are considered Stam. However, a piece of silver is considered specified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Even a piece of silver is considered Stam, but wooden beams are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> Why do the above Amora'im say that money is Stam, but not an animal, piece of silver, or beams?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to them, we should also say that money is Stam, but not Kinim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Kinim really are specified!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Chisda taught that a Ken is specified only when the owner buys it, or when the Kohen offers it. This shows that it is as Stam as money!</p>
