<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EXPRESSIONS OF ACCEPTING <i>NEZIRUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Kinuyim (substitute names) for Nezirus are like expressions of Nezirus;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one said 'I will be', he is a Nazir. If he said 'I will be beautiful', he is a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one said 'Nazir', 'Nazik', 'Nazi'ach', or 'Pazi'ach', he is a Nazir. If he said 'I will curl my hair', 'I will Mekalkel', or 'I will let my hair grow', he is a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir says, if he said 'it is Alai (incumbent on me) to bring birds', he is a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim say, he is not a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is Nezirus in Seder Nashim (the Mishnayos that teach laws of women)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding (immoral) women, it says "...he saw in her immorality." (Usually,) wine caused her to sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anyone who sees a Sotah in her disgrace should become a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Tana mention Kinuyim, and then explain Yados (incomplete expressions)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It should say "all Kinuyim for Nezirus are like expressions of Nezirus. Yados for Nezirus are like Nezirus. These are Yados: if one said 'I will be', he is a Nazir..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Mishnah mentions Kinuyim before Yados, it should explain Kinuyim before Yados!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Tana first explains the last thing mentioned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Example #1 (Mishnah):</span> With what may we light (Neros Shabbos), and with what may we not light?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Tana first explains what we may not use to light.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Example #2 (Mishnah):</span> In what may we enclose (food to keep it warm on Shabbos), with what may we not enclose?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Tana first explains what we may not use to enclose.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Example #3 (Mishnah):</span> What may a woman wear in a Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos, what may she not wear?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Tana first explains what she may not wear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Sometimes the Tana first explains the first matter mentioned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Example #1 (Mishnah):</span> What may one leave on his animal when it goes in a Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos, what may he not leave on it?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Tana first explains what one may leave on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Example #2 (Mishnah):</span> Some (pairs of relatives) inherit and bequeath to each other. In some cases, one inherits the other but does not bequeath to him. In some cases, one bequeaths to the other but does not inherit him. In some cases, neither inherits nor bequeaths to the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Tana first explains which inherit and bequeath to each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sometimes the Tana first explains the first thing mentioned. Sometimes he starts with the last thing mentioned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the Isur (prohibition) applies to the person himself (lighting, wrapping, or wearing), he first explains the Isur. When the Isur pertains to animals, he first explains what is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding inheritance, the primary case (sons inheriting their father) is explained first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> In our Mishnah, Kinuyim should be explained first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question (j)):</span> The Tana expounded Yados from a verse, so it is dearer to him, so he explains it first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should teach Yados before Kinuyim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana first mentions the primary expression; he starts by explaining Yados.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>INCONCLUSIVE <i>YADOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I will be', he is a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he meant, I will (be in a) fast!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The case is, a Nazir passed in front of him when he said this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shmuel holds that an inconclusive Yad is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Tosfos' preferred text) Confirmation:</span> Correct! When a Nazir passed in front of him, we have no doubt what he meant (the Yad is conclusive). If a Nazir did not pass in front of him, perhaps he intended to fast.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Text of the Rosh, the text Tosfos rejects) Rejection:</span> Really, Shmuel can hold that an inconclusive Yad is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When a Nazir passed in front of him, he probably intended to be a Nazir - this is an inconclusive Yad;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If a Nazir did not pass in front of him, it is just as likely that he intended to fast - this is not a Yad at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he intended to bring the Korbanos for the Nazir (but not to be a Nazir himself)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he says that he intended to be a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, obviously he is a Nazir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought this is not considered that his intention agrees with what he said. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>'I WILL BE BEAUTIFUL'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I will be beautiful', he is a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he intended to beautify himself in Mitzvos, e.g. a beautiful Sukah, Lulav, Tzitzis, and a beautiful Sefer Torah wrapped in silk!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> He was holding his hair when he said this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Nezirus is a sin. It cannot be called beautiful!</p>
