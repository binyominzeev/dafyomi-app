<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A LIMB LACKING FLESH (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "One who touches a bone..." refers to a bone k'Se'orah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>"Or a corpse" teaches about a limb detached from a Chai without sufficient flesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"Or a Mes" teaches about a limb detached from a Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Or a grave" teaches about a grave from before the Torah was given. (One might have thought that "Adam Ki Yamus" refers only to one who will die after Matan Torah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of a limb from a Mes?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it has a bone k'Se'orah, we learned this from "a bone"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it has no bone k'Se'orah, yet the verse says that it is Metamei! (This supports Reish Lakish (53b), and refutes R. Yochanan!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> Really, the limb has a bone k'Se'orah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We know from "a bone" that it is Metamei one who touches. "Or a corpse" is Metamei one who moves it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN HE RESTARTS <i>NEZIRUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They sprinkle on him on days three and seven... (he does not restart Nezirus Taharah until he becomes Tahor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does 'until he becomes Tahor' mean until dark on the seventh day, like R. Eliezer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, does it mean until he brings Korbanos on day eight, like Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The coming Mishnah says 'he resumes Nezirus immediately.' This implies that our Mishnah means, until he brings Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Chachamim, who say that Nezirus Taharah begins on day eight.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>TUM'OS</i> THAT DO NOT NULLIFY DAYS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nazir became Tamei through any of the following, he does not shave and bring Korbanos Nazir Tamei. He does not lose the days he counted. They sprinkle on him on days three and seven, and he immediately resumes counting:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Schachos or Pera'os (these will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A field in which a grave was lost or plowed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chutz la'Aretz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A cover of a coffin (Tosfos - a monument) or its supporting stones;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>A Revi'is of blood;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Tum'as Ohel of a quarter Kav of bones;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Kelim that touched a Mes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>The days of Sefirah (the seven days a Metzora counts between the two times he shaves) and the days of Muchlat (when he had a Siman of absolute Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">54b----------------------------------------54b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A tradition from Sinai teaches that days of Zivah and a Metzora Musgar (waiting to see if he will become Muchlat) count towards Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Schachos are (foliage of) trees hanging over the ground. Pera'os are rocks protruding from a wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chutz la'Aretz...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did Chachamim decree Tum'ah on (one who enters) the air of Chutz la'Aretz?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, did they decree on (one who towers above) the soil?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> They sprinkle on him on days three and seven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the decree was for entering the air (it is a mere stringency, not due to Tum'as Ohel), there would be no reason to sprinkle!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> They decreed about the soil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, they decreed on the air. Regarding the other Tum'os it says that they sprinkle on him on days three and seven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> The Mishnah also lists Kelim that touched a Mes. We do not  sprinkle for these!</p>
