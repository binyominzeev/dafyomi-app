<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A KEZAYIS OF ISUR BI'CHEDEI ACHILAS PRAS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>This is not difficult for me (Abaye). I say that Heter joins with Isur (but not when the majority is Heter). The case is, there is more than one Se'ah of Chulin. (Even if the Terumah fell into the Chulin, the majority is Chulin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if the Torah forbids a k'Zayis bi'Chedei Achilas Pras, this is even if the majority is Chulin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> The Beraisa discusses nowadays, that Terumah is only mid'Rabanan. Therefore, we are lenient.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE SOURCE THAT <i>HETER</i> JOINS WITH <i>ISUR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Why do you say that "Mishras" teaches that Heter joins with Isur? Perhaps it comes only to forbid Ta'am k'Ikar (a food that absorbed the taste of Isur, like in the coming Beraisa)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Abaye asked all the above questions, to prove that Heter joins with Isur regarding all Isurim. Why does he now suggest that even regarding Nazir, it does not join?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Abaye accepted Rav Dimi's answers. He then asked that even regarding Nazir, perhaps we forbid only Ta'am k'Ikar!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Mishras" forbids Ta'am k'Ikar. If one soaked grapes in water, and the water has a taste of wine, a Nazir is liable for drinking it. We learn from here to all Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Isurei Nazir are not permanent, they do not forbid all benefit, and there is a Heter for the  Isurim (a Chacham can permit Nezirus. Alternatively, it is permitted to become a Nazir.) Still, the Torah forbids Ta'am k'Ikar;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Kilayim (crossbreeds) in a vineyard are permanently forbidden, all benefit is forbidden, and the Isur cannot be permitted. All the more so, the Torah forbids Ta'am k'Ikar!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Orlah (fruits of a tree before its fourth year) are likewise more severe than Isurei Nazir in two of these three ways. (However, the fruits do become permitted, i.e. what grows after three years. Alternatively, one can permit fourth-year fruits (outside Yerushalayim, or b'Tum'ah) through redemption. Alternatively, it is permitted to (plant trees and) create the Isur). All the more so, Ta'am k'Ikar is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Avahu said that R. Akiva learns from "Mishras" that Heter joins with Isur. (The Tana of this Beraisa disagrees.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did R. Avahu learn that R. Akiva says so?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> Even if he soaked his bread in wine, and there is enough to join to a k'Zayis, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps he is liable only if there is a k'Zayis of wine!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is the Chidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that one is liable for a k'Zayis. The first Tana obligates only for a Revi'is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> If a Nazir soaked his bread in wine and ate a k'Zayis of bread and wine, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>R. AKIVA'S SOURCE FOR <i>TA'AM</i> <i>K'IKAR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Avi):</span> Since R. Akiva uses "Mishras" to teach that Heter joins with Isur, what is his source to forbid Ta'am k'Ikar?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> He learns from meat and milk:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The meat absorbs only a taste of milk (or vice-versa), and it is forbidden. We learn to all cases!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say that we cannot learn from meat and milk, because it is exceptional.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is exceptional about meat and milk?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Each is permitted by itself, but together they are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is not exceptional. The same applies to Kilayim (mixing seeds of (or grafting) diverse species of vegetation, working with or crossbreeding different species of animals, and wearing a garment of wool and linen)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one soaks them together they are permitted (even if they absorb taste from each other), but if they are cooked together, they are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> For this reason, also R. Akiva should not learn from meat and milk!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">37b----------------------------------------37b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> He learns from absorbed tastes in Kelim of Nochrim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Whatever Kelim are used with fire (must be Kashered before usage)" teaches that absorbed tastes in Kelim of Nochrim are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though it is merely taste, it is forbidden. We learn from this to all cases!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha):</span> Why don't Chachamim learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It is exceptional:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Normally, detrimental tastes are permitted. Detrimental tastes absorbed in Kelim of Nochrim are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since it is exceptional, why does R. Akiva learn from it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna bar Chiya):</span> The Torah forbids only a Kli used in the last 24 hours, and the absorbed taste is not detrimental;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that even within 24 hours, the absorbed taste is slightly detrimental.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CAN WE LEARN TO OTHER CASES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha):</span> We should learn from Chachamim to R. Akiva!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim expound "Mishras" to forbid Ta'am k'Ikar regarding Nezirus, and they learn to all Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva expounds "Mishras" to teach that Heter joins with Isur regarding Nezirus. He should also learn to all Isurim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The Torah taught that Heter joins with Isur in two cases, Nezirus and Chatas. Shnei Kesuvim (a principle the Torah taught twice, and one of them could have been learned from the other) do not teach to other cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We already discussed Nazir. The case of a Chatas is as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "any (food) that touches its (a Chatas') meat will become Kodesh" applies even if the food did not absorb!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "In its meat" teaches that it is forbidden only if it absorbed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Yikdash (it becomes Kodesh)" like the Chatas. If the Chatas was Pasul (and may not be eaten), the food may not be eaten. If the Chatas was Kosher, the food may be eaten with the stringencies of the Chatas (that day, in the Mikdash, by Kohanim. This teaches that Ta'am k'Ikar. However, we already learned Ta'am k'Ikar from absorptions in Kelim of Nochrim, so Chatas teaches that Heter joins to Isur.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim hold that we could not learned Chatas from Nazir or vice-versa (therefore, we cannot learn from it that Heter joins to Isur, and we learn Ta'am k'Ikar to elsewhere):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nezirus is Chulin, therefore we cannot learn it from Chatas, which is Kodshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot learn Chatas from Nezirus, because the Torah is extra stringent about Nezirus, and forbids even Chartzanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Akiva agrees that we cannot learn Chulin from Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, he holds that we could have learned Chatas from Nazir, just like we learn in general from Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Chachamim agree that (we could have learned Chatas from Nazir, therefore) Chatas teaches that Heter joins with Isur. We cannot learn from Kodshim to Chulin (that Heter joins with Isur);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn Ta'am k'Ikar from Nazir ("Mishras") to all cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Akiva says that both teach that Heter joins with Isur. Since this was taught in two places, we do not learn to other cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi - Beraisa):</span> "From all that comes from the grapevine" teaches that Isurei Nazir join.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Akiva, even Heter joins with Isur, all the more so, forbidden foods join!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> Heter joins with Isur only when they are eaten together. Forbidden foods join even when eaten one after the other.</p>
