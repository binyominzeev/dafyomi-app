<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN ARE ANIMALS CONSIDERED SPECIFIED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Papa - Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If a man designated three animals for his Nezirus, and did not specify which is for which Korban, the one Kosher for the Chatas is (offered) for the Chatas, the one Kosher for the Olah (the yearling) is for the Olah, and the one Kosher for the Shelamim (the second year ram) is for the Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that animals are considered specified!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> Regarding a Ken, it says "he will take" and "he will offer." This teaches that a Ken is specified only when it is bought, or when the Kohen offers it;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Korbanos Nazir, you cannot say that the Chatas will be offered for the Olah. The Chatas is a female, and the Olah is a male!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Hamnuna):</span> A Ba'al Mum is not like Stam money!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When can a Nazir bring the Korbanos of his father? Levi was a Nazir (the Meforshim prefer this text). He separated money for his Nezirus, and died. His son said 'I am a Nazir on condition that I bring the Korbanos of my father.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(When the son does not bring his father's Korbanos.) Stam money goes to Nedavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he had a specified animal:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it was a Chatas, we leave it to die. An Olah is (offered) for an Olah, and a Shelamim is (offered) for a Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This applies even if the animal had a Mum! (We redeem a Ba'al Mum Olah or Shelamim, and use the money for a similar Korban.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it refers to a Tam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Ba'al Mum is like Stam money, the Mishnah should say that a Ba'al Mum goes to Nedavah (and all the more so, Stam money)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kedushah of a Ba'al Mum is its value (it is destined to be redeemed). The Mishnah teaches about money, and this includes a Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CAN A SON BRING HIS FATHER'S <i>KORBAN</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> "His Korban" teaches that one is Yotzei with his own Korban, but not with his father's Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he is not Yotzei for a severe sin with a Korban that the father separated for a light sin, or vice-versa, but he is Yotzei for a sin of the same severity!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "His Korban" - one is Yotzei with his own Korban, but not with his father's.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he is not Yotzei with an animal his father separated, even for sins of the same severity, just like a Nazir cannot bring animals that his father separated for the father's Nezirus;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, he is Yotzei (if he buys an animal) with money that the father separated, even for sins of different severity, just like a Nazir is Yotzei with Stam money of his father, but not with specified money!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "His Korban" one is Yotzei with his own Korban, but not with his father's. (The Gemara brings the rest of the Beraisa before explaining Rava's question.)</p>
