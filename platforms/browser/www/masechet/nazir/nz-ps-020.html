<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>NEZIRUS IN CHUTZ LA'ARETZ (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree that the decree was on the soil (Tosfos - on the airspace);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai hold that the Nazir was fined to conduct standard Nezirus in Eretz Yisrael. Beis Hillel hold that he was fined to start over.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A case occurred... (R. Yehudah says, Hilni was a Nezirah for only 14 years.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yehudah hold that she became Teme'ah, according to Beis Shamai; or she did not become Teme'ah, according to Beis Hillel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> At the end of the seven years, she came up to Eretz Yisrael. Beis Hillel ruled that she must be a Nezirah for seven more years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she became Teme'ah, according to Beis Shamai, why does R. Yehudah say she was a Nezirah for only 14 years? She would have needed to observe 14 years and 30 days!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yehudah citing R. Eliezer):</span> "Zos Toras ha'Nazir b'Yom Melos" - if he became Tamei on the last day, he must observe standard Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONY ABOUT <i>NEZIRUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If one pair of witnesses testify that Reuven accepted two terms (Rashi - years) of Nezirus, and another pair says that he accepted five, there is a contradiction in the testimony. Therefore, we do not force Reuven to be a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel say, the witnesses who say five agree that he accepted at least two. He must be a Nazir twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Our Mishnah is unlike the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Berokah):</span> If one set of witnesses says two, and another says five, Beis Shamai agree that he must be a Nazir twice;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about when there are only two witnesses, and one says two, and one says five:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Beis Shamai say that there is a contradiction in the testimony, so Reuven need not be a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Beis Hillel say that the one who says five agrees that he accepted at least two, so Reuven must be a Nazir twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> All agree about when they count out the Neziruyos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chama):</span> What does Rav mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One witness says that he accepted five and not two, and the other says that he accepted two, not five.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They contradict each other! (Obviously, all agree that Reuven is exempt!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, one says 'he accepted one, two', and the other says 'he accepted three, four, five.'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why must this be taught?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi):</span> Rav said (in the Yerushalmi) that all agree (that the testimony is Batel) when they count the Neziruyos in the severe case (two pairs of witnesses). Must he teach this also in the lenient case (of only two witnesses)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (text of Tosfos, Rosh):</span> Objection: Why is this considered contradictory testimony?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The one who is stringent (and says 'three, four five'), all the more so agrees that he accepted (at least) two! (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> When they count, this is not considered contradiction.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HATFASAH IN A NAZIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said 'I am a Nazir'; another (heard him and) said 'and I'; (and another said) 'and I', they are all Nezirim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the first annulled his Nezirus, the Nezirus of all of them is annulled. If the last annulled his Nezirus, he is not a Nazir, but the rest of them are Nezirim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven said 'I am a Nazir'; and Shimon said 'my mouth is like his mouth', or 'my hair is like his hair', Shimon is also a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven said 'I am a Nazir'; and his wife said 'and I', Reuven can annul her Nezirus, and he is still a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If Leah said 'I am a Nezirah', and her husband said 'and I', he cannot annul her Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If Reuven said to his wife 'I am a Nazir, and you?', and she replied 'Amen', Reuven can annul her Nezirus, and he is still a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If Leah said to her husband 'I am a Nezirah, and you?', and he replied 'Amen', he cannot annul her Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Reish Lakish):</span> This is when each said 'and I' Toch Kedei Dibur (within the time to speak).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the time needed to greet someone with Shalom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the time needed for a Talmid to greet his Rebbi (Shalom Alecha Rebbi).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yehudah Nesi'ah):</span> This does not leave time for a Talmid (who wanted to accept Nezirus like Reuven, and his Rebbi came. He must greet his Rebbi, and then it is too late to say 'and I'!)!</p>
