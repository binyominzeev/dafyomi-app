<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN IS <i>REKEV</i> <i>TAMEI</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When is Rekev Tamei? If the Mes was buried without clothes in a marble casket, or on a stone floor;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If it was buried clothed, or in a wooden casket or on a brick floor, the Rekev is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Rekev is Tamei only if it came from flesh, sinews and bones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> Rekev that comes from flesh is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it came from bones, even without flesh, it would be Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. The Beraisa means that Rekev that comes from flesh is Tahor, unless there were bones with the flesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are no sinews!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Whenever there are flesh and bones, there are sinews.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shemen bar Aba):</span> Two Mesim buried together are Galgalin to each other (each counts as a foreign decaying matter which causes the Rekev of the other to be Tahor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Nasan b'Rebbi Oshaya - Beraisa):</span> Rekev that comes from two Mesim is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They were buried separately and decayed. They combined to form a spoon's worth of Rekev.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>QUESTIONS ABOUT <i>REKEV</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> If the hair was cut and buried with the Mes, it is Galgalin to the Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Every part of a Mes is Tamei, except for the teeth, hair and nails; when they are attached, even these are Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Chizkiyah):</span> Are hair and nails of a Mes that are destined to be cut considered as if they are already cut, or are they considered to be attached? (This determines whether or not they are Tamei, or whether or not they are Galgalin to the Mes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can infer the answer from Rabah bar bar Chanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are Galgalin only because they were cut. If they were only destined to be cut, they would be considered attached!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Rabah bar bar Chanah was sure that if they were cut, they are Galgalin. If they were only destined to be cut, he was unsure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> Is Rekev of the heel Tamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps the law of Rekev does not apply to Rekev of the heel (since this area is dead even in a man's lifetime);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps there is no distinction!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nasan b'Rebbi Oshaya - Beraisa):</span> Rekev that comes from two Mesim is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(We said that exactly one spoonful came from the Mesim combined.) If Rekev from the heel is Tahor, perhaps some of the spoonful came from the heel, and there is less than the quantity for Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We never had a question if the entire body decayed, and the Rekev came only from the heel (this is surely Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Clarification of question:</span> If only the heel and the surrounding area decomposed, is the Rekev Tamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (R. Yirmiyah):</span> Is a fetus in the womb Galgalin to the mother?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since we learned that a fetus is considered like a limb of the mother, it is like part of her body, and it is not Galgalin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps since it was destined to leave, it is considered a separate matter!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If you will say that a fetus is considered separate, is semen in the womb Galgalin?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">51b----------------------------------------51b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the fetus (which will leave) was not yet formed, it is like part of her body?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since it came from outside of her, is it not like part of her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Is excrement inside of her Galgalin?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that since she cannot live without eating, it is like part of her?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since it came from outside of her, is it not like part of her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> Is skin (Rashi - phlegm; Birkas Rosh - hair (not about to be cut)) Galgalin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna bar Mano'ach):</span> Are phlegm and mucus Galgalin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shmuel bar Acha):</span> If all of these are Galgalin, in what case is Rekev Tamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> (Shortly before death), he drank water of (a spring between two particular) palm trees (which cleans all waste out of the body). The Mes was anointed with a salve (that removes hair) and cooked in hot water of Teveriyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If the Mes was ground up, it is not considered Rekev.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it was ground up and later decayed, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Rekev depends only on flesh, sinews and bones that decay, this is Rekev;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps the body must be in its normal state and then decay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AN INCOMPLETE <i>MES</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula bar Chanina - Beraisa):</span> The following laws do not apply to an incomplete Mes:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rekev;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Tefusah (if one moves a full Mes, he must take with it the dirt under it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A burial site (if three full Mesim are found in close proximity, the area is established to be a burial site).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Tum'ah of a Mes is stringent, for the following have Tum'as Ohel: (bones comprising) the majority (of the number of bones in the body, or of the stature) or a quarter Kav (about half a liter), or a spoon's worth of Rekev. None of these apply to a Chai (a live person).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case (that a Mes has Rekev, but a Chai does not)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One limb decayed. Regarding a Mes, such Rekev is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Mishnah did not say that corresponding Rekev of a Mes is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says only that sometimes Rekev applies to a Mes, but it never applies to a Chai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If a limb decayed in a person's lifetime, and then he died, is the Rekev Tamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does the tradition apply only to a Mes that decayed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he is now dead, the law now applies?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> Tum'ah of a Mes is stringent, for the following have Tum'as Ohel: (bones comprising) the majority or a quarter Kav, or a spoon's worth of Rekev. None of these apply to a Chai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Rekev does not apply because he is alive, but after death, it applies!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Mishnah did not say that Rekev applies after he dies!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says only that sometimes Rekev applies to a Mes, but it never applies to a Chai.</p>
