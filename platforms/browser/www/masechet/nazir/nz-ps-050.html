<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FOR WHICH <i>TUM'OS</i> MUST A <i>NAZIR</i> SHAVE? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> R. Meir is dead, and R. Yehudah is angry. If I am silent, what will be of the Torah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> We must teach about a (full) Mes for the case when it lacks a k'Zayis of flesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why must it be taught? If he shaves for one limb, all the more so for the full body!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Yochanan explained in a similar Mishnah that a (full) Mes is taught for a stillborn baby whose limbs are not tied with sinews (therefore, one of his limbs is not Tamei). The same answer applies here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It must be taught for bones comprising the majority of the bones or stature, even though the bones are not the volume of a quarter of a Kav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> For a k'Zayis of Netzel...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Netzel? (According to Tosfos' text, this is a Beraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is flesh of a Mes that (liquefied and) hardened, or fluid (that exuded from a Mes) and can be boiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we don't know whether or not it came from the Mes, even if it hardened, why does he shave for it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, we know that it came from the Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, even if it didn't harden, he must shave!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmiyah):</span> The case is, we have no prior knowledge. If it hardens, it is definitely fluid of the Mes. If it does not harden, (perhaps - apparently, Tosfos' text does not say 'perhaps') it is phlegm or mucus.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>NETZEL</i> OF ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Does Netzel apply to animals?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Was the tradition from Sinai said only regarding a human Mes?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is there no distinction? (Amora'im argue about a Neveilah, i.e. an animal that died without slaughter. One opinion says that a Neveilah has severe Tum'ah, i.e. can be Metamei even people and Kelim as long as it is fit for people to eat. It has light Tum'ah (like food) as long as a dog can eat it. The other opinion says that it has severe Tum'ah as long as a dog can eat it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>There is no question according to the former opinion. (Netzel was never fit for people, so it never has severe Tum'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>What is the law according to the latter opinion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If one melted the Neveilah of a Tahor bird (Tosfos; Rashi - the Chelev of a Neveilah) over a fire, it is Tamei. If he melted it in the sun, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it has severe Tum'ah as long as it is fit for a dog, even in the sun, it should be Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It becomes spoiled and unfit for a dog before it melts in the sun.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS A POURED LIQUID CONSIDERED CONNECTED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When pouring a Tahor liquid into Tamei food, the top liquid remains Tahor, except for a very thick type of honey, or honey with beeswax;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">50b----------------------------------------50b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Shamai say that even porridge of ground or whole beans are exceptions, because they recoil when one ceases pouring.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> Is a poured (solid) food considered connected?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Are the liquids in the Mishnah considered connected because drops recoil, and this does not happen to solids?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is the law of the Mishnah because those liquids are thick, and solids are also thick?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If a k'Zayis of Chelev of a Mes (the minimal amount to be Metamei) was melted:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was initially one chunk, it is Tamei. If it was initially disconnected pieces, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Surely, during the melting, part of the chunk poured down.) If a poured food were not considered connected, even if it started as a chunk, it would not be Tamei! (If it was ever considered disconnected, human actions cannot cause it to be considered connected.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Zeira):</span> No, the case is, by cooking it, a k'Zayis rose to the top of the Keli and hardened there (it was always connected and never poured).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> Beis Shamai say that even porridge of ground or whole beans are exceptions, because they recoil when one ceases pouring. (We are thinking that the first Tana agrees that recoiling makes the liquids connected, but he holds that porridge does not recoil enough.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> No, the first Tana holds that they are connected because they are thick.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE QUANTITY OF <i>REKEV</i> FOR <i>TUM'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (He shaves for) a spoon's worth of Rekev (corrosion of a Mes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is a spoon's worth?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> It is a palm full.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is two handfuls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A spoon's worth of Rekev is from the joints of the fingers and above;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Chachamim say, it is two handfuls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan holds like Chachamim, but Chizkiyah is not like either Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A palm full equals the amount from the joints of the fingers and above.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (and Answer #2 - Rav Simi bar Ada):</span> What forces us to say this? Perhaps 'from the joints of the fingers and above' means, from the joints towards the wrist (i.e. the palm)!</p>
