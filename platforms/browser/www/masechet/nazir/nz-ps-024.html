<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman accepted Nezirus and designated an animal for her Korban, and her husband annulled her Nezirus:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was his animal, it may graze with the flock (it has no Kedushah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was her animal, if it was a Chatas, it must die. If it was an Olah, it is offered for an Olah. If it was a Shelamim, it is offered for a Shelamim, but it may be eaten only for one day, and bread (Lachmei Nazir) is not brought with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she had set aside money for the Korbanos Stam (without specifying for which), it goes to Nedavah (to buy Olos Tzibur to offer when the Mizbe'ach is idle);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If she specified money for each Korban, the Demei (money for the) Chatas is thrown into the Dead Sea. We may not benefit from it. If one benefited, he did not transgress Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Demei Olah is used to buy an Olah. If one benefited from the money, he transgressed Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Demei Shelamim is used to buy a Shelamim. It is eaten for one day and night, and bread is not brought with it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW A WIFE GETS THE ANIMAL FOR HER <i>KORBAN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Version #1 - Question:</span> Who is the Tana of our Mishnah, who exempts a husband from paying for his wife's Korbanos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is the Chachamim who argue with R. Yehudah (in the following Beraisa). It cannot be R. Yehudah. Since he obligates her husband to pay, if she designated one of his animals, it would remain Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If a woman must bring a Korban, even if she is poor, her husband (if he is rich) must bring the Korban of a rich person on her behalf;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He must pay for all Korbanos that she must bring, for he wrote to her (in the Kesuvah) 'all your obligations are Alai.' (Tosfos' text - (in the receipt for payment of her Kesuvah) she writes to him '(I pardon) all obligations that you have to me.')</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> The Mishnah is even like R. Yehudah. He must pay only for what she truly needs. (Since he annulled her Nezirus, she does not need the Korbanos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> Who is the Tana of our Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Yehudah. A husband must pay only for what his wife truly needs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be Chachamim. They totally exempt him from paying for her Korbanos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Chachamim, before he annulled her Nezirus, how would she designate Korbanos? (Normally, all a woman's property belongs to her husband!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He gave her animals, and she made a Kinyan (a legal acquisition. Previously he authorized her to take animals for Korbanos. If he agreed to give her animals for Nezirus, this is Kiyum, and he could not annul later!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, there is no distinction between his animals and hers! (Therefore, the Mishnah cannot be like Chachamim.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> The Mishnah is like Chachamim. He allows her to acquire only what she truly needs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the animal was hers, if it is a Chatas, it must die. If it is an Olah, it is offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did she acquire an animal? A husband receives whatever his wife acquires!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> She ate less than he is obligated to feed her, and saved the difference.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Someone else gave her an animal on condition that her husband has no rights to it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>SHALMEI</i> <i>NAZIR</i> OFFERED WITHOUT BREAD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An Olah is offered for a Olah. A Shelamim is offered...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel):</span> How do we explain the following teaching?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Four rams (Shelamim of a Nazir) are brought without bread - hers, his, after death, and after atonement.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Avuha bar Ihi):</span> 'Hers' is like in our Mishnah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">His - (Mishnah):</span> A man can impose Nezirus on his son. A woman cannot impose Nezirus on her son;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the son shaved or protested, or relatives shaved him or protested (this annuls the Nezirus his father put upon him). If money was designated for the Korbanos Stam, it goes to Nedavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If money was specified for each Korban, Demei Chatas is thrown into the Dead Sea. We may not benefit from it; if one benefited, he did not transgress Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Demei Olah is used to buy an Olah. If one benefited from the money, he transgressed Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>Demei Shelamim is used to buy a Shelamim. It is eaten for one day, and bread is not brought with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">After death - (Mishnah):</span> If one designated money for Korbanos Nezirus, we may not benefit from it. If one benefited, he did not transgress Me'ilah, because all the money could be used to buy the Shelamim (to which Me'ilah does not apply);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he died, and money was designated for the Korbanos Stam, it goes to Nedavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If money was specified for each Korban, Demei Chatas is thrown into the Dead Sea. We may not benefit from it; if one benefited, he did not transgress Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Demei Olah is used to buy an Olah. If one benefited from the money, he transgressed Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>Demei Shelamim is used to buy a Shelamim. It is eaten for one day, and bread is not brought with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>After atonement (the Nazir designated a Shelamim, lost it, offered a different animal for Shelamim, then found the original animal) is learned from reasoning:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When the Nazir died, we offer the Shelamim without bread because it is not for atonement. The same applies if the Nazir already offered a different animal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are more cases!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All other Shalmei Nazir that were slaughtered improperly (e.g. Lo Lishmah, or it was still in its first year) are valid, but the Nazir was not Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Shelamim is eaten for one day. It does not require bread or (to cook) the foreleg (and give it to a Kohen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana counts only Korbanos that were offered properly.</p>
