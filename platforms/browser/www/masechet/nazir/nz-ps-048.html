<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi) Question:</span> A Nazir may not be Metamei for his relatives "in their death", but he may be Metamei through their leprosy or emissions. What is the source for this regarding a Kohen Gadol?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was not needed to write "for his mother" regarding a Kohen Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A regular Kohen may be Metamei for his paternal brother, but a Kohen Gadol may not be Metamei for his father. A regular Kohen may not be Metamei for his maternal brother, so all the more so, a Kohen Gadol may not be Metamei for his mother!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Since we can learn from a Kal v'Chomer, "for his mother" is free for a Gezeirah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>It also says "for his mother" regarding a Nazir. Just like a Nazir may be Metamei through relatives' leprosy or emissions, but not their corpses, also a Kohen Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A NAZIR MAY BE METAMEI FOR A MES MITZVAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We expounded that a Kohen Gadol may be Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah. What is the source regarding a Nazir?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "...Al Nefesh Mes Lo Yavo" refers even to an animal, which is called "Nefesh Beheimah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> "Al Nefesh Mes" refers to a person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (R. Yishmael):</span> We need not learn from there. "Lo Yavo" discusses a Tum'ah imparted by entering (an Ohel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> "For his father and for his mother" he may not be Metamei, but he may be Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the verse teach this? A Kal v'Chomer teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Kohen Gadol's Kedushah is permanent, and he may be Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah. All the more so, a Nazir may, for his Kedushah is temporary!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kal v'Chomer can be challenged. A Kohen Gadol may be Metamei because he does not bring a Korban for Tum'ah, but a Nazir brings a Korban for Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Therefore, we need a verse to permit him to be Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we should expound that he may not be Metamei for a parent, but he may for others (strangers)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A regular Kohen may be Metamei for relatives, but not for strangers. A Nazir may not be Metamei for relatives, all the more so he may not for strangers.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Therefore, the verse forbids Tum'ah for a parent, and permits for a Mes Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be able to learn from a Kohen Gadol!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah teaches that a Kohen Gadol may not be Metamei for relatives, and also regarding a Nazir. Just like a Kohen Gadol may be Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah, we should say the same for a Nazir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have thought that we should learn from a regular Kohen!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah teaches that a regular Kohen may not be Metamei, and also regarding a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like a regular Kohen may be Metamei for relatives, we should say the same about a Nazir!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Since we would not know if we should learn a Nazir from a Kohen Gadol or from a regular Kohen, the verse is needed to forbid Tum'ah for a parent, and to permit for a Mes Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we need to learn that he may not be Metamei for a parent, we cannot also learn that he may be Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, "for his father" forbids Tum'ah for his father. "For his brother" he may not be Metamei, but he may be Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"For his mother" is used for the Gezeirah Shavah, like Rebbi taught.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If a man (not necessarily a Nazir) was going to slaughter his Korban Pesach or circumcise his son, and he heard that a relative died, perhaps he should be Metamei to bury the relative!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "For his sister" he may not be Metamei, but he may be Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says "A soul (this is the correct text, for he expounds the verse by Nazir)" forbids Tum'ah for strangers. "Mes" forbids Tum'ah for relatives;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"For his father and for his mother" he may not be Metamei, but he may be Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"For his brother" teaches that a Nazir Kohen Gadol may not be Metamei for his brother, but he may be Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"For his sister" teaches like the Beraisa, i.e. if a man was going to slaughter his Korban Pesach or circumcise his son...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Akiva learn Rebbi's Gezeirah Shavah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since "for his brother" permits a Nazir Kohen Gadol to be Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah, surely the same applies to any Kohen Gadol;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"For his father and to his mother" is free for the Gezeirah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yishmael learn that a Nazir Kohen Gadol may be Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Torah permitted a Lav (for a Kohen Gadol or Nazir) for a Mes Mitzvah, also two Lavim are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yishmael learn from "for his sister"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that a Mes Mitzvah overrides only Lavim, but not Korban Pesach or circumcision, which are punishable by Kares for one who neglects to do them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse teaches that a Mes Mitzvah overrides even these.</p>
