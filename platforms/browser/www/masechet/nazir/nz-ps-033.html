<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say 'those whose words were not fulfilled'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, even one whose first words were not fulfilled, but his latter words were fulfilled (is a Nazir).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the approaching man reversed direction, (the first two men) are not Nezirim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> This is only because the man reversed direction. Had we recognized him, (the one who was correct) would be a Nazir!</p>
