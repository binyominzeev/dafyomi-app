<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FLOATING <i>TUM'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the first Tana say that it is Tahor in either case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Avdimi - contradiction):</span> "Any Sheretz that swarms" connotes anywhere it swarms;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It also says "on the ground"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> If one definitely touched it, he is Tamei. If he is in doubt (it was floating), he is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula - contradiction):</span> It says "but a spring (will be Tahor)", and "will be Tamei"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Safek Tum'ah floating in water in a Kli is Tamei. If the water is in the ground, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Any Safek Tum'ah that is carried or dragged is Tamei, for it is as if it is resting;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If Tum'ah or Taharos (Tahor things) were thrown, a Safek (about touching) is Tahor. The only exceptions are (Safek Tum'as Ohel, e.g.) if a k'Zayis of a Mes was thrown, or Taharos were thrown (perhaps) above Tum'as Mes, and anyone who is Metamei (Kelim made to sit or lie on) what is on top of it just like what is below it, i.e. a Zav or Zavah (they are Metamei what they move even without touching it).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IF THE <i>TUM'AH</i> IS ON SOMETHING THAT IS FLOATING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> If Tum'as Mes is on a Kli that is floating on water, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we consider it to be resting in a Kli?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we consider it to be floating on the water?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If you will say that it is like resting in a Kli, if it is on a dead (floating) Sheretz, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since Tum'as Mes is Metamei for seven days, and a Sheretz is Metamei only for one day, it is as if the Tum'as Mes is on a Kli;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we view them like one Tamei entity that is floating?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If you will say that we consider it to be resting in a Kli, if a Sheretz is on a Neveilah (an animal that died without slaughter), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since both of them are Metamei for one day, they are like one Tamei entity?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since the volumes needed to be Metamei are different (a k'Zayis of a Neveilah, and a lentil's volume of a Sheretz), is it as if the Sheretz is on a Kli?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If a Sheretz is on a Sheretz, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the volume to be Metamei is the same, we view them like one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since they are distinct, is it as if the top Sheretz is on a Kli?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> If you will say that it is considered to be on a Kli, if a Sheretz is on a dissolved Neveilah, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since it is dissolved, it is as if the Sheretz is floating on a liquid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is the Neveilah considered a food (and not a liquid)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #5:</span> If you will say that the Neveilah is considered a food, if the Sheretz is floating on semen, what is the law? (Is it considered a liquid? Or, since it comes from the body, is it like a food?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #6:</span> If you will say that it is like a food, what is the law if the Sheretz is floating on Mei Chatas (water mixed with ashes of the red heifer) (which is floating on plain water - Gra deletes this from the text, for in all of these questions what is on bottom is floating. Mei Chatas is thick, so perhaps it is not considered a liquid,)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This is not resolved.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN DOES THE LAW OF <i>TUM'AS</i> <i>HA'TEHOM</i> APPLY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> If a Nazir or an Oseh Pesach passed over Tum'as ha'Tehom on his seventh day of Taharah from Tum'as Mes, he is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tum'as ha'Tehom is not strong enough to uproot (a Nazir's count or an Oseh Pesach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If he went to immerse from Tum'as Mes, he is Tamei, for his Chazakah (status quo) was Tamei. If his Chazakah was Tahor, he is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Hamnuna):</span> I admit regarding a Tamei Nazir who did not yet shave that Tum'as ha'Tehom makes him Tamei. (I discussed a Tamei Nazir who already shaved.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> I agree that an Oseh Pesach is not lacking anything (he was sprinkled on and immersed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> His Taharah is incomplete until nightfall!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Nightfall comes by itself, so he is not considered lacking Taharah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Abaye later accepted this answer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (Korban Yoledes is brought for a birth or miscarriage.) If a woman miscarries after the 80 days of Taharah after giving birth to a girl, she brings another Korban Yoledes for the miscarriage. If she miscarried within the 80 days, one Korban Yoledes exempts both the birth and the miscarriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If she miscarried within 80 days, and had another miscarriage within the next 80 days (but more than 80 days after the birth), she must bring another Korban for the latter miscarriage!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> She brings "upon completion of her days of Taharah", not during them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> Because also the second miscarriage was before she was allowed to bring her Korban, her Korban also exempts the miscarriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does she (always) bring another Korban for a single miscarriage after 80 days (i.e. even if she did not immerse yet? Even without the miscarriage, even if she immersed that day,) she could not bring her Korban until the next day!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The sun sets by itself, so it is as if she can bring her Korban.</p>
