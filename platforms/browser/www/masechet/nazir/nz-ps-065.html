<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN ARE WE CONCERNED FOR A BURIAL SITE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one finds a Mes lying down, like normal, he may relocate it, taking its Tefusah (underlying soil) with it. The same applies if he finds two Mesim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he finds three Mesim between four and eight Amos apart, the area is assumed to be a burial site. He must check 20 Amos for more Mesim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If another Mes is found within 20 Amos, he must check another 20 Amos from there, for there is supporting evidence (that there are more).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he only found the one Mes, he would be allowed to move it with its dirt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah says 'if he found' to exclude a known Mes. 'Dead' excludes someone murdered. 'Lying' excludes sitting. 'Normally' excludes when the head rests between the thighs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Ula bar Chanina):</span> An incomplete Mes does not have the law of Tefusah, and it does not count towards establishing a burial site.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are all these cases excluded?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the Mes is a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If two Mesim are found, the head of each is by the feet of the other, they do not have the law of Tefusah, and do not join to establish a burial site.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If three Mesim are found, and one or two of them were known to have been buried there, they do not have the laws of Tefusah or a burial site.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yesheivav once found two known Mesim and one unknown Mes. He wanted to declare the area to be a burial site.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva ruled like above. It is a burial site only if all three were known or all unknown.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TEFUSAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He takes them and their Tefusos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Tefusah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "You will take me from Mitzrayim" (this is extra) - take (soil) from Mitzrayim with me.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much soil must be taken?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> All the ground-up soil underneath, and the depth of three fingers of virgin soil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok):</span> He takes the chips from the coffin and the clumps of dirt. He may discard what is certainly not from the deceased, but hides away what is doubtfully from the Mes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is definitely from the Mes joins to the quantity to be Metamei, i.e. the majority of bones of the body, or bones comprising most of the stature, or a spoonful of Rekev.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar holds like the following Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yochanan):</span> He takes the ground-up soil underneath, and three fingers' depth of virgin soil.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CHECKING THE AREA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He checks from there...</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">65b----------------------------------------65b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> If a man found a Mes and buried it elsewhere, he found another Mes and did the same, and he found a third Mes, he may not move it, and he need not return the first two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rava):</span> Since he was permitted to move the first two, he is permitted to move this one also.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This area should be established to be a burial site!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> They found an excuse to be Metaher Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he checked 20 Amos and did not find another Mes, what is the law? (Tosfos - must he check in other directions also, or until finding virgin soil? Rosh - does this prove that this area was not a burial site?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Menasya bar Yirmiyah):</span> It is a burial site. (Tosfos - one need not check more. The Rosh deletes the following question and answer from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> They found an excuse to be Metaher Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SAFEK TZARA'AS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> As long as a Nega (an appearance of Tzara'as) was not declared Muchlat, any Safek is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once a Nega was Muchlat, any Safek is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of the first law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "To be Metaher or Metamei" - the Torah puts Taharah first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, even after the Nega was Muchlat, a Safek should be Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Rav Yehudah's teaching answered a different question.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Baheres (a Nega in the skin) has a white hair:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the skin turned white before the hair did, this is a sign of (Muchlat) Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If the hair turned white before the skin, the Nega is Tahor (not Muchlat);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we do not know which turned white first, it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehoshua Keihah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'Keihah' mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> He ruled that it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps R. Yehoshua ruled that it is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "To be Metaher or Metamei" - the Torah puts Taharah first.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>REASONS FOR EMISSIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man had an emission (of Zivah, i.e. uncooked semen) before he was established to be a Zav, we check if any of seven factors may have caused the emission: eating or drinking (too much, or foods that induce emissions), carrying a heavy load, jumping, sickness, a sight, or thoughts;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he already is a Zav, we do not check. If a Zav sees (an emission) due to Ones (one of these factors), or if there is a Safek, or he had a seminal emission, it is Tamei, for there are Raglayim l'Davar (solid grounds to say this. If it is the third sighting, it obligates him to bring a Korban after he counts seven clean days and becomes Tahor. If it is a later sighting, it negates any clean days counted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>David hit Levi. It seemed that Levi would die. He improved, but later got worse and died. David is liable for murder;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Nechemyah exempts him, for there are Raglayim l'Davar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of laws (a) and (b)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nasan):</span> "Veha'Zav Es Zovo (a male or a female)" - after two flows, a man is equated to a woman, who becomes Tamei even from blood due to Ones (other factors).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> We check a man regarding his third emission, but not his fourth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana'im argue about whether or not we expound the word "Es":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer expounds it (to allude to another flow). He learns that after three flows, a man is equated to a woman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim do not expound it. They learn like above.</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
