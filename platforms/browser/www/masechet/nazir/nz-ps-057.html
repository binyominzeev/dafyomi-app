<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which law was a tradition, and which was (not a tradition, and was used) for the Kal v'Chomer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Possibility #1:</span> The tradition was that a Nazir shaves for a bone k'Se'orah. Tum'as Ohel of a Revi'is of blood was not a tradition.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Possibility #2:</span> The tradition was Tum'as Ohel of a Revi'is of blood. It was not a tradition that a Nazir shaves for a bone k'Se'orah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> A Nazir shaves for a bone k'Se'orah. This is a tradition from Sinai, so it cannot be used in a Kal v'Chomer to teach that he shaves also for a Revi'is of blood.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN IN DOUBT WHICH <i>NAZIR</i> IS <i>TAMEI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man told two Nezirim 'I saw that one of you became Tamei, but I do not know which', they shave and bring (collectively) the Korbanos of a Tahor Nazir and a Tamei Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One of them says 'if I was Tamei, Korbanos Nazir Tamei were mine, and Korbanos Nazir Tahor were yours. If I was Tahor, vice-versa.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They observe 30 more days of Nezirus, and bring Korbanos Nazir Tahor. They stipulate that these Korbanos are for the one who was Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since a third person saw them, why do we consider them to be Safek Teme'im?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn about Safek Tum'ah in a Reshus ha'Yachid (a private domain) from Sotah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>There, only two were present (she and the suspected adulterer). The law of Safek Tum'ah in a Reshus ha'Yachid (it is considered definite Tum'ah) applies only when at most two were present!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When there are three, we apply the law of Safek Tum'ah in a Reshus ha'Rabim (it is considered definitely Tahor)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> The observer saw, from afar, Tum'ah thrown between the two Nezirim (there were not three people together).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> I do not know which of you became Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This connotes that he never knew.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SHAVING WHEN IN DOUBT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They shave and bring Korbanos...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> Why may they shave (the second time)? The second shaving of the one who was Tahor is not for Nezirus, so he transgresses cutting the Pe'os (sideburns)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The case is, the Nezirim are women or children (who may cut their Pe'os).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Shmuel say that they can be men, and one does not transgress for Hakafas Kol ha'Rosh (cutting all the hair on the head, including the Pe'os)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Shmuel forbids Hakafas Kol ha'Rosh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mar Zutra - Mishnah):</span> If a Nazir became Safek Tamei (Mes), and he was a Safek Metzora Muchlat, he can eat Kodshim after 60 days. He shaves four times (twice for (Safek) Tzara'as, for (Safek) Nazir Tamei, and for Nazir Tahor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why may he shave four times? He transgresses Hakafah (if he was not a Muchlat or not Tamei Mes, some of these are unnecessary! The text of Rashi and Tosfos says 'he transgresses shaving (the beard), i.e. if he was not a Muchlat.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The case is, the Nazir is a woman or child (they are permitted to shave the beard and sideburns).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHO IS COMMANDED ABOUT THE <i>PE'OS</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> One who cuts the Pe'os of a child is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ada bar Ahavah:</span> Who cuts your children's Pe'os?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> Chovah (my wife) cuts them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ada:</span> She should bury her sons! (If you obligate a man who cuts a boy's Pe'os, also a woman is liable! Rav Huna disagreed (see below). Rosh - this was not a curse. Rather, he asked, is she not concerned lest she be punished, and will bury her sons?!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For the duration of Rav Ada's life, Rav Huna did not have children (from her) that survived.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Huna and Rav Ada both forbid Hakafas Kol ha'Rosh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna equates "do not round the corners of your head" and "do not destroy the corners of your beard." Whoever is commanded about the beard is commanded about the Pe'os;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since women are not commanded about the beard, they are not commanded about the Pe'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Ada holds that the verse equates the Makif (one who cuts Pe'os) and the Nikaf (one whose Pe'os are cut);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Whenever the Nikaf is liable, the Makif is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah does not punish children. Since a child is exempt, one who is Makif a child is exempt.</p>
