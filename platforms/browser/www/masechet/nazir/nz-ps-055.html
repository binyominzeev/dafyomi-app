<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE DECREE ON <i>CHUTZ</i> <i>LA'ARETZ</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about the decree on Chutz la'Aretz:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> One who enters Chutz la'Aretz in a box becomes Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, he remains Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yosi holds that they decreed on the soil, and Rebbi holds that they decreed on the air.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No, all agree that they decreed on the soil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi holds that an Ohel that is Zaruk (moving) is considered an Ohel (the bottom of the box shields from Tum'as Ohel of the soil), and Rebbi disagrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (in Tosfos) Objection (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> If a box full of Kelim was thrown over a Mes, the Kelim become Tamei. If the box was stationary, the Kelim remain Tahor. (This shows that he agrees that an Ohel Zaruk is not an Ohel!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Support (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> If a box full of Kelim was thrown over a Mes, the Kelim become Tamei. If the box was (carried by people or animals) on the ground, the Kelim remain Tahor. (This shows that he holds that an Ohel Zaruk is an Ohel.) (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Both hold that the decree was on the air;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi holds that Chachamim did not decree about entering Chutz la'Aretz in a box, since this is uncommon. Rebbi holds that they decreed even in such a case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one enters Chutz la'Aretz in a box, he is Tahor. If he enters in a wagon, boat or large ship with a mast, he is Tamei. (This is like R. Yosi.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #3:</span> They argue about whether or not we decree lest he stick his head or the majority of his body outside the box.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> If one enters Chutz la'Aretz in a box he is Tahor until he sticks out his head or the majority of his body.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DAYS OF ABSOLUTE <i>TZARA'AS</i> AND COUNTING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He (re-)starts counting...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This applies only to a small Nezirus. Regarding a long Nezirus, the days (of Sefirah and of Muchlat) count.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Sharbiya - Mishnah):</span> He begins counting immediately, and does not cancel previous days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If he was a Nazir for only 30 days, previous days are Batel, for he must grow 30 days of hair to complete Nezirus!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">55b----------------------------------------55b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it was a long Nezirus. The Mishnah says that he starts counting immediately (after Taharah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sharbiya):</span> Rav Chisda discusses a 'long Nezirus', i.e. when 30 days remained after the Tzara'as, e.g. a 50 day Nezirus and he became Muchlat after 20 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After shaving at the end of Tzara'as, he observes the 30 remaining days of Nezirus.</p>
