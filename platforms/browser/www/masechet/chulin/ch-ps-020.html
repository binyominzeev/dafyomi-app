<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SHECHITAH AND MELIKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Bnei R. Chiya - R. Yanai - Mishnah):</span> Anything Kosher for Shechitah is invalid for Melikah. Anything Kosher for Melikah is invalid for Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It teaches about moving the Simanim behind the spine. (It is Kosher for Shechitah, and hence invalid for Melikah. Since the Reisha teaches a Chidush, we can say that the Seifa was included just for parallel structure.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to both questions - Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> No. It teaches about a tooth or fingernail. (Rashi - when attached, these are Kosher for Melikah, and invalid for Shechitah. Others explain that when detached, they are Kosher for Shechitah and invalid for Melikah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Another Mishnah teaches this (15b or 68a)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to both questions - R. Yirmeyah):</span> It excludes Molich and Mevi (moving the knife or fingernail away and returning it), which is Kosher for Shechitah and invalid for Melikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like the opinion that Molich and Mevi is invalid for Melikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that it is Kosher for Melikah, what does the Mishnah teach?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Bnei R. Chiya must hold that Molich and Mevi is invalid for Melikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> The Mitzvah of Melikah is to (press the fingernail and) cut straight down into the neck. This is the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (R. Avin):</span> He holds that only this is Kosher, but not Molich and Mevi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If this is Kosher, all the more so, Molich and Mevi is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what does he exclude (through the words 'this is the Mitzvah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means that even this (cutting through pressing) is the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> Whatever is Kosher for Shechitah, correspondingly on the Oref is Kosher for Melikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Whatever is invalid for Shechitah is invalid for Melikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this teach?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It teaches that Ikur (uprooting the Simanim) disqualifies Melikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rami bar Yechezkeil taught that Ikur does not apply to birds!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It teaches that Melikah is invalid on the (back of the) head.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious. The Torah said "Mul (facing the) Oref"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Papa refers to the bottom of the back of the head (where it slants in. Alternatively, he cut on an incline until he reached the Simanim).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If the first third was Hagramah, and the last two thirds were proper Shechitah, it is invalid. (R. Yirmeyah teaches that the same applies to Melikah.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IKUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha):</span> Rami bar Yechezkel taught that Ikur does not apply to birds. This is like the opinion that the Torah does not require Shechitah of birds;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>According to the opinion that Shechitah (of birds) is mid'Oraisa, Ikur applies to birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> Just the opposite! If Shechitah is mid'Oraisa, we can say that a tradition from Sinai teaches that Ikur does not apply to birds;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even if a verse teaches that birds must be slaughtered like animals, many laws of Shechitah are only a tradition. Perhaps Ikur was a tradition;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Chachamim obligated Shechitah, presumably they would equate birds to animals for all laws of Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava bar Kisi):</span> Rami bar Yechezkeil taught that Ikur does not apply to birds, i.e. Melikah. Ikur disqualifies Shechitah of birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yirmeyah taught that whatever is Kosher for Shechitah, correspondingly on the Oref is Kosher for Melikah. We inferred that whatever is invalid for Shechitah is invalid for Melikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava bar Kisi argues with R. Yirmeyah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CUTTING THE NECKBONE BEFORE THE SIMANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> If the neckbone and most of the flesh were cut, the animal is a Neveilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> A Mishnah already teaches this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Melikah was done with a knife, if someone later eats the bird, he and the clothes he is wearing (when he swallows) become Teme'im (since the bird is Neveilah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If cutting the neckbone and most of the flesh would not make it a Neveilah, only a Treifah, Melikah with a knife would be like slaughtering a Treifah (since the Simanim are cut after the neckbone and most of the flesh);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This cannot be, for a slaughtered Treifah is not Neveilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We could explain the Mishnah even if cutting the neckbone and most of the flesh makes it only a Treifah. Melikah done with a knife makes a Neveilah, for it is not at all like Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it unlike Shechitah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> It is Chaladah. (Rashi - the knife is covered up in the neck when it cuts the Simanim; Tosfos - the Simanim are cut in the wrong direction, from back to front.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It is Derasah (he cuts by pressing, and not through Molich and Mevi).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Huna did not answer like Rava, for he holds that Molich and Mevi is Kosher for Melikah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rava did not answer like Rav Huna, for he holds that Chaladah is only when the knife is totally hidden, like a CHuLDAH (rodent) in a mousehole.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rava):</span> According to Ze'iri, what does Melikah accomplish? The bird is already dead before the Simanim are cut!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question (Abaye):</span> (Even without Ze'iri,) how do you understand Melikah of an Olah, in which both Simanim must be cut?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Cutting one Siman already kills the bird (it suffices for Shechitah, or Melikah of a Chatas). The second Siman is cut on a dead bird!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Cutting the second Siman is not part of the Melikah. It is to fulfill the Mitzvah of dividing (the head from the body), which applies after death.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, also the skin should be cut!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mitzvah of dividing applies only to what must be cut in Shechitah (i.e., the Simanim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Chachamim say that the Simanim must be totally cut for Melikah, whereas for Shechitah, it suffices to cut the majority of each Siman!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (Rava):</span> Rather, the Mitzvah of dividing applies only to those things that must be cut in Shechitah.</p></div>
