<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>EXPOSED LIQUIDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> This shows that we are more stringent about danger than about prohibitions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Three liquids are forbidden if they were exposed: water, wine and milk;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they are exposed for the amount of time it takes for a snake to come from a nearby hiding place and drink, one may not drink them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered a nearby place?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak brei d'Rav Yehudah):</span> It is to come from under the handle of the flask, and drink.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If they were exposed only for the time to come and drink, if a snake drank, one would still see it (for it had no time to return)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they must be exposed for the time of a snake to come, drink and return to its hole.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DOUBTS THAT ARISE AFTER SHECHITAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If after Shechitah, a nick was found in the knife, even if the knife was used to break bones the entire day (after the Shechitah, before it was checked), the Shechitah is invalid. We are concerned lest the nick came when the knife cut the animal's skin, before cutting the Simanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The animal is permitted. We assume that the nick came when cutting a bone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Rav Huna holds like he taught;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> An animal is forbidden (to eat) when it is alive. After death, we assume that it is still forbidden unless we know that it was slaughtered properly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, what is Rav Chisda's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A bone certainly can cause a nick. Perhaps the skin can. We attribute (the nick) to something certain, and not to something doubtful.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> A Tamei man immersed, and later found a Chatzitzah (obstruction) on his body. Even if he was working the whole day (after immersing) with the substance he found on his body, the Tevilah does not count, unless he is sure that there was no Chatzitzah when he immersed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Here, he certainly immersed, and we are unsure if there was a Chatzitzah, and we assume that what is doubtful occurred!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That case is different. We know that the man was Tamei. We leave him in his status quo.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Here also, the animal was forbidden before Shechitah. We should leave it in its status quo, and say that it was not slaughtered!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You cannot say that. It is slaughtered in front of us!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also here, the man immersed in front of us!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding the man, something (the Chatzitzah) suggests that the Tevilah was invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also regarding Shechitah, the blemish on the knife suggests that the Shechitah was invalid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the blemish is not on the party in question (the animal itself). Regarding Tevilah, the blockage is on the man himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Chisda - Beraisa):</span> If one slaughtered the Vesht, and then the Kaneh was uprooted, it is Kosher. If the Kaneh was uprooted before cutting the Vesht, it is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one found the Kaneh uprooted, and does not know whether this happened before or after cutting the Vesht, any Safek Shechitah is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do the words 'any Safek Shechitah is invalid' come to include?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They include our case (that Rav Huna and Rav Chisda argue about).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, they include when we are unsure whether he paused or pressed during the Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is that invalid, but (according to Rav Chisda) our case is not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, there was a problem in the animal itself. In our case, there is not. (The problem is only in the knife.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HOW DO WE RULE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Halachah follows Rav Huna when the knife was not used to cut bones afterwards. The Halachah follows Rav Chisda when the knife was used to cut bones afterwards.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we needed to say that the Halachah follows Rav Huna when the knife was not used to cut bones afterwards, this implies that Rav Chisda argues. To what does he attribute the blemish in the knife?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It became blemished through the neckbone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A case occurred in which Rav Yosef forbade 13 animals due to a blemish found in the knife after they were all slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This must be like Rav Huna. Also the first animal was forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #1 - Rejection:</span> It can be even like Rav Chisda. The first animal was permitted, and the rest were forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #2:</span> Indeed, it must be like Rav Huna;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Chisda is lenient to say that the knife became blemished on the neckbone. If so he should be lenient also to say that it became blemished on the neckbone of the last animal, and permit all of them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Rav Kahana required butchers to check their knives after every Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He holds like Rav Huna. If a blemish is found, this disqualifies the previous Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he can hold like Rav Chisda. Even if a blemish is found, we attribute it to the neckbone. The Shechitah was Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The knife must be checked to avoid invalid Shechitah of subsequent animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, (we check afterwards for the sake of subsequent Shechitos), we should require a Chacham to check the knife (just like a Chacham must check it before Shechitah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One witness is believed to testify about what is permitted and forbidden. (We trust the butcher to say that he checked it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, similarly, we should not require a Chacham to check the knife before Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Correct! R. Yochanan taught that the only reason we require the Chacham to check the knife is for the honor of the Chacham.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WE RELY ON CHAZAKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim say that when in doubt, we follow Chazakah (the status quo). What is the source for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> "The Kohen will leave the house (with Tzara'as), to the entrance. He will close (quarantine) the house for seven days."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps when he left, the plague got smaller, and it is now smaller than the size needed to quarantine a house!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We rely on Chazakah, and assume that the plague is still large enough!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> Perhaps the Kohen exited the house walking backwards, and saw the plague the whole time!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It says "he will leave the house." Walking backwards is not called 'leaving'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> If the plague is in back of the door, in any case he cannot see it after exiting!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he makes an opening in the door to see the plague.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> We do not make a window in a dark house to enable the Kohen to see the plague. (The same applies here.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava - to Answer #1):</span> It says "(the Kohen Gadol) leaves (the Kodesh ha'Kadoshim)", and a Mishnah says that he exits the way he entered. This shows that walking backwards is called 'leaving'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava - to Answer #2):</span> Perhaps we do not make an opening to see if a discoloration in the wall is truly a plague, but once a plague was seen, we make a window to see if it is still the proper size!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Question (against Rav Acha bar Yakov - Beraisa) Suggestion: Perhaps "the Kohen will leave the house" teaches that he returns to his own house, (and later returns,) and closes (the house)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "to the entrance";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "to the entrance" teaches that he stands in the doorway and closes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "From the house" teaches that he fully leaves the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>To fulfill both, he stands outside the doorway and closes it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"And he will close the house" teaches that even if he returned to his own house and closed, or closed it from inside the plagued house, it is quarantined. (Even though he cannot see the plague from his own house, he may assume it still has the required size, unlike Rav Acha!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, there is a line of people from plagued house to the Kohen's house, and they tell him that the plague still has the required size.</p></div>
