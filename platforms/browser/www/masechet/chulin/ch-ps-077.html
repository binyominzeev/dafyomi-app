<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CAN SINEWS HELP COVER A BONE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A break was covered by sinews.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> There is no concern. R. Yochanan holds that sinews are as good as flesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Sinews that harden (in a mature animal) are considered like meat regarding (eating) Korban Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Also, the Torah is concerned for the money of Yisrael. (Therefore, we should not be stringent.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> How can you be lenient, against the opinion of Reish Lakish - the question involves a Torah Isur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rava was silent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was Rava silent? He taught that the Halachah follows Reish Lakish against R. Yochanan in only three cases (not including this)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This case was not included, because R. Yochanan retracted to agree with Reish Lakish.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Don't ask me from that Mishnah (which says that the skin of the head is considered meat, even though it will later harden). An individual taught it. The Halachah does not follow it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A broken bone stuck out. A piece of it fell off. Abaye did not reach a conclusion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Mishnah says that if the majority of flesh remains, it is Kosher. It does not matter if part of the bone fell off.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (Ravina):</span> What is the law in the following cases? The surrounding flesh is scattered, or it is flattened out, or it is Mismasmes?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is 'Mismasmes'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> It is rotted flesh that a doctor scrapes away.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions:</span> If the flesh is punctured, or peeled off the bone, or cracked, or if the bottom third is missing, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to the last question - Ula):</span> Skin is like flesh. (If the skin is intact, even if the bottom third is missing, it is Kosher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps that is only when the skin is in its proper place. (Here, it is far from where it should be.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If the skin is like a ring (a large hole goes through), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> If the area is scraped with another bone, it will heal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It should not be scraped with iron, for this will make grooves and aggravate it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The cure works only if the bone is where the hole is.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A FETAL SAC</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughtered an animal and finds a fetal sac, if it does not repulse him, he may eat it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>It does not have Tum'as Nevelah, nor Tum'as Ochlim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one intended to eat it, it receives Tum'as Ochlim, but it is not a Nevelah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If a fetal sac partially left the womb (before Shechitah), one may not eat (any part of) it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A fetal sac indicates that there was a fetus, both in a woman and in an animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If an animal giving birth for the first time miscarried, and a fetal sac came out, it may be cast to dogs (it does not have Kedushas Bechor);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If a Korban miscarried a fetal sac, it must be buried;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It may not be buried at the fork in the road, nor may it be suspended in a tree, for these are Darchei ha'Emori (ways of idolaters.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "You will eat every animal" includes a fetal sac;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is even if part of it left the womb!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You will eat it", but not a fetal sac that partially left.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since a fetal sac always contains a child (albeit squashed), if part of it left, we must be concerned lest it was born (and Shechitah did not permit it). Why is a verse needed to forbid it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the verse is only an Asmachta.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It is not Metamei...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> If a donkey's hide was cooked for a long time, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he ask about? Whether he asks about Tum'as Ochlim, or Tum'as Nevelah, a Beraisa explicitly answers this!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">77b----------------------------------------77b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The skin and a fetal sac are not Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim, unless the skin was overcooked and one intended to eat the fetal sac.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Nivlaso" - (the meat of the carcass is Tamei,) but not the skin, bones, sinews, horns, or hooves.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Surely, these are not meat. The verse is needed only (to be Metaher from Tum'as Nevelah even) if they were cooked and seasoned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he asked about Tum'as Ochlim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Beraisa discusses other skins. Donkey skin is repulsive. Perhaps it is not Mekabel Tum'ah even after overcooking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the fetal sac (partially) left the womb (the entire sac is forbidden).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Elazar):</span> This applies only if there is not also a fetus. If there is also a fetus, we are not concerned that (there was a twin, and) the sac contains a (dissolved) fetus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Whether or not there is also a fetus, we are concerned lest there is a fetus in the sac.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yirmeyah taught that R. Elazar is more stringent than R. Yochanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Elazar):</span> This applies only if the sac is not tied to a fetus. If it is, we are not concerned lest the sac contains a fetus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Mishnah applies if there is not also a fetus. If there is also a fetus, whether or not it is tied to the sac, we are not concerned lest there is a fetus in the sac.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This version is like R. Yirmeyah's teaching (R. Elazar is more stringent than R. Yochanan.) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for R. Elazar - Beraisa):</span> If a woman miscarried the form of a animal or bird, and a fetal sac:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they are tied together, we are not concerned lest the sac contains a fetus (regarding Tum'as Yoledes);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they are not tied together, we are concerned lest (there was also a human fetus, and) the sac of the animal dissolved, and the human fetus in the remaining sac dissolved. We are stringent for both possibilities. (Rashi - we are also concerned lest the animal was the fetus of this sac and she is not a Yoledes. Tosfos - we are concerned for the stringencies of Yoledes Zachar and of Yoledes Nekevah.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE KEDUSHAH OF A BECHOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an animal giving birth for the first time miscarried (the fetus may be fed to dogs).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ika brei d'Rav R. Ami):</span> Most animals born are Kosher for Kodshim. The minority are not, i.e. Nidmeh (the child resembles a different species than the mother);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Half of all animals born are female (which do not get Kedushas Bechor);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since half of all firstborn animals are male, and some of them are Nidmeh, a minority receive Kedushas Bechor. (We assume that the fetus is from the majority.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kodesh animal miscarries, the fetus must be buried.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This is because most animals born are Kosher for Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not bury it...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> Anything done to heal is not (forbidden due to) 'Darchei (ways of) the Emori (Nochrim).' If it does not (have a logical or medical reason why it should) heal, it is Darchei ha'Emori.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> If a tree's produce falls off, one ties a ribbon around the tree and puts stones on it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We understand putting stones on it (to weaken it, so it will not cast down its produce), but there is no sound reason for the ribbon!</p></div>
