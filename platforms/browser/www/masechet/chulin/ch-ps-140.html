<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #5:</span> It says "uv'Anfohi Yeduran Tziparei Shemaya"! (Surely, Tamei and Tahor birds nest in this great tree!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tamei birds are included in the term "Tziparei Shemaya." They are not called (plain) Tzipor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Question #6 "(You may eat) Kol Tzipor Tehorah" implies that some Tziporim are Teme'im!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, some Tziporim are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are they forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They are Terefos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Another verse explicitly forbids Terefos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They were slaughtered to be Metaher a Metzora.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The following verse forbids them!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"V'Zeh Asher Lo Sochelu" includes the Shechutah (the bird slaughtered for Taharas Metzora).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is the Shechutah. The Torah forbids it with a Lav and an Aseh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Kol Tzipor Tehorah" excludes a Terefah, to forbid it with a Lav and an Aseh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the next verse alludes to the Shechutah, also this verse does.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #7:</span> "Shtei Tziporim Chayos" (are used to be Metaher a Metzora).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "Chayos" teach?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This teaches that they may be eaten (i.e. they are Tehorim). This implies that some Tziporim are Teme'im!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means that their limbs are Chayim (complete).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #8:</span> "(Shtei Tziporim Chayos) Tehoros" (are used for Taharas Metzora). This implies that some Tziporim are Teme'im!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, it excludes Terefos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> "Chayos" excludes Terefos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Partial answer:</span> According to the opinion that a Terefah can live, it does not exclude Terefos.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>According to the opinion that a Terefah cannot live, the objection remains!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael's teaching excludes Terefos!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> The Torah discusses Machshirim (things that permit) and atonements brought in the Mikdash, and Machshirim and atonements brought outside the Mikdash;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>In the Mikdash, the laws of Machshirim (Korbanos that complete the Taharah of Tamei people, allowing them to eat Kodshim) and atonements (Chata'os) are the same (they must be Kosher Korbanos). Also outside the Mikdash, the laws of Machshirim (birds of a Metzora) and atonements (the goat sent to Azazel on Yom Kipur) are the same;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Just like the goat cannot be Terefah, also birds of a Metzora.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It excludes birds from an Ir ha'Nidachas (a city that is burned because the majority of its residents served idolatry).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (One bird is slaughtered, and the other is Meshulachas (sent away).) For which do we need a verse to disqualify birds of an Ir ha'Nidachas?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is for the Meshulachas.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Reasoning alone excludes a bird from an Ir ha'Nidachas. If we sent it, someone might find it and eat it, not knowing that it is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the verse teaches that the Shechutah may not be from an Ir ha'Nidachas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> "Tehoros" teaches that after slaughtering one bird (for Taharas Metzora), we may not pair a third bird with the remaining bird to be Metaher another Metzora.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (If not for the verse,) what could we do with the remaining bird?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We could not slaughter it. It must be sent to be Metaher the first Metzora!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, one might have thought that we send it to be Metaher both Metzora'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Papa):</span> "Tehoros" excludes birds bought with money (or objects) of idolatry;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Hayisa Cherem Kamohu" - whatever you get from (buy with) idolatry is forbidden like idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we need the verse to disqualify such a bird from being the Shechutah, or the Meshulachas?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Surely, we cannot send it. Someone might find it and eat it, unaware that it is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it disqualifies it from being the Shechutah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Ravina):</span> "Tehoros" excludes a bird that killed a person.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If Beis Din sentenced it to die, we must kill it. Surely it cannot be used for a Metzora!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Beis Din did not sentence it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the verse disqualify such a bird from being the Shechutah, or the Meshulachas?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely it cannot be sent. It must be taken to Beis Din to fulfill "u'Viarta ha'Ra mi'Kirbecha"!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rather, it disqualifies it from being the Shechutah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>OTHER EXEMPTIONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Tamei bird sitting on Tahor eggs...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We understand why the Mitzvah does not apply to this. The Torah discusses a (mother that is a) Tzipor, and not a Tamei bird.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Tahor bird sits on Tamei eggs, why is there no Mitzvah to send it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We answer like Rav Kahana said (elsewhere). "Tikach Lach" teaches that the Mitzvah applies when you may take the eggs to eat, but not (only) for your dog.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did Rav Kahana say this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If the mother is Terefah, the Mitzvah applies. If the chicks are Terefos, there is no Mitzvah.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> "Tikach Lach", but not for your dog.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should equate the law of the mother to the chicks. Just like there is no Mitzvah when the chicks are Terefos, the same should apply when the mother is Terefah!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">140b----------------------------------------140b</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> A mother (on) a chick that is Terefah must be sent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It means, (even) a mother of a chick that (it, the mother) is Terefah must be sent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Hoshaya):</span> If a man slaughtered the minority of the Veshet (foodpipe) of chicks in a nest, must he send the mother?</p></div>
