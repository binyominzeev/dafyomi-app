<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE SHECHITAH OF KUSIM (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Conclusion):</span> Had R. Zeira not accepted the answer, he would have said that the decree was on unsupervised Shechitah, and they ate from supervised Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, R. Zeira accepted the answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they decree?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They decreed for the same reason that R. Meir did;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir sent R. Shimon ben Elazar to bring wine from a city of Kusim. An elder warned "put a knife in your cheek, if you value your soul" (i.e. don't drink their wine).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When R. Meir heard this, he decreed that wine of Kusim is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> He found Kusim worshipping a graven dove on Har Grizim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Meir generally is concerned for a minority. (Here, he forbids wine of all Kusim due to those who are idolators.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Also R. Gamliel and his Beis Din are also concerned for a minority, like R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the primary meaning of "put a knife in your cheek, if you value your soul"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It discusses a Talmid learning in front of his Rebbi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> "When you sit to combat the ruler (to learn from your Rebbi), contemplate what is in front of you. Put a knife in your cheek, if you value your soul" - ask a question only if you think that your Rebbi can answer. If not, refrain from asking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Avahu sent R. Yitzchak bar Yosef to bring wine from a city of Kusim. An elder warned him that the residents do not guard the Torah. When R. Avahu heard, he told R. Ami and Rav Asi. They decreed that Kusim are like Nochri in all respects.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did their decree affect?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It forbade the Shechitah and wine of Kusim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Gamliel and R. Meir already decreed about them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The previous decrees were not accepted. The decree of R. Ami and R. Asi was accepted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding what did they make them totally like Nochrim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> In an alleyway that opens to a courtyard in which a Kusi lives, one may not carry in on Shabbos. It does not help if he grants full rights of access to his premises to all. The only solution is if the members of the alley rent his property.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Yisrael Mumar that keeps Shabbos in public can grants rights of access to his premises to all in the alleyway, and this allows them to carry. If he desecrates Shabbos in public, it does not help if he allows access to his premises.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Yisrael can grant access. A Nochri must rent out his premises to permit carrying.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the Yisrael says, 'my property is acquired to you. It is Batel to you', this suffices. An act of acquisition is not needed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>COULD A TZADIK SIN WITH FORBIDDEN FOOD?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Zeira and Rav Asi lodged at an inn. They served them eggs that had been shriveled in wine. R. Zeira did not eat; Rav Asi ate.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Aren't you concerned lest they absorbed Demai (doubtfully tithed) wine?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Asi:</span> I did not think about that.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Zeira thought, can it be that mixtures containing Demai are forbidden, and Rav Asi mistakenly ate one?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Hash-m does not allow a pitfall to come even through animals of Tzadikim, all the more so through Tzadikim themselves!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Zeira found a source that indeed, such mixtures are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who buys wine to put into brine or a potion of wine and oil, or vetch to make brine, or lentils to make groats (minced lentils), he must tithe them if they are Demai, and all the more so if they are Tevel (definitely untithed)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If one buys the mixture itself, there is no obligation to tithe a mixture containing Demai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> One who gives his neighbor a dough to bake or a pot to cook, he need not worry that she leavened or spiced it with sourdough or spices of Tevel or Shemitah produce;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he told her to use her sourdough or spices, he must be concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There is different. Since he told her to use hers (she is like his Shali'ach to mix in Demai), it is as if he himself mixed in Demai. Therefore, he must tithe it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rafram):</span> Sourdough and spices are different. They are added (to ferment, or) for their taste, so they are not Batel.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WILL AN IGNORAMUS SWITCH SOMEONE'S FOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Why does the Beraisa permit?) We should be concerned lest an ignoramus switch one's food!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who gives to his mother-in-law (dough to bake) must tithe the dough he gives to her and the bread he receives, because she will switch it if it is spoiling.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah explained the reason there.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, we are concerned lest she switch because she wants her daughter to eat well, but she is ashamed to tell this to her son-in-law.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are we really not concerned (in general) lest an ignoramus switch one's food?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who gives to the inn-keeper (dough to bake) must Ma'aser the dough he gives to her and the bread he receives, because she is suspected to switch it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There also, she rationalizes her action. This Talmid should eat fresh, warm bread, and I will eat cold bread! (Rashi - she wants to benefit the Talmid. Tosfos - this is said incredulously. She feels that she should eat better than him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are we really not concerned (in general) lest an ignoramus switch one's food?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Version #1 - Tosfos - Mishnah):</span> The wife of a Chaver (fully observant man) may grind grain with the help of Le'ah (an ignoramus' wife) when Le'ah (knows that she herself) is Teme'ah, but not when she (thinks she) is Tehorah (for then, Le'ah will take some to eat, and make it Tamei);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, even when Le'ah is Teme'ah she may not help, lest Le'ah's friend Rachel (also an ignoramus' wife, who considers herself to be Tehorah) give Le'ah to eat (and Rachel will make the grain Tamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This shows that an ignoramus' wife will steal. All the more so, she is suspected to switch!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Version #2 - Rashi - (Mishnah):</span> Sarah, a Chaver's wife, may help Le'ah (an ignoramus' wife) to grind when Sarah is Teme'ah, but not when she is Tehorah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, even when Sarah is Teme'ah she may not, lest Le'ah give her to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This shows that an ignoramus' wife will steal (from her husband). All the more so, she is suspected to switch! (end of Version #2))</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> There also, she rationalizes her action. An ox is entitled to eat while threshing! (Also a person who helps is entitled to eat.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE STATUS OF BEIS SHE'AN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Zeruz testified in front of Rebbi that R. Meir ate a leaf of a vegetable from Beis She'an without separating Ma'aseros. Based on this, Rebbi declared that Beis She'an is exempt from Ma'aseros (except for grain, wine and oil).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi's family:</span> Your ancestors forbade this (to eat Tevel from Beis She'an). Will you permit it?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rebbi):</span> "(Chizkiyahu) ground up the copper serpent that Moshe had made, because Yisrael were serving it as idolatry." How is it that Asah and Yehoshafat eradicated all idolatry from the world, but not this serpent?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> You must say that his ancestors left room for him to aggrandize himself. Also, my ancestors left room for me!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>This teaches that if a Chacham says an innovative law, we do not Mezi'ach (separate him from) his teaching. Some say that we do not Mazni'ach (despise) his teaching. Some say, we do not Mazchi'ach it (attribute it to haughtiness).</p></div>
