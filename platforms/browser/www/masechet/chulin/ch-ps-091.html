<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHAT IS FORBIDDEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (and Answer #3 to Question d:1 - Rav Ashi):</span> The Beraisa discusses the fat surrounding the Gid ha'Nasheh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Mid'Oraisa, the fat around the Gid is permitted. Yisrael are Kedoshim, and they do not eat it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #3 (and Answer #4 - Ravina):</span> The Beraisa discusses the outer Gid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The inner Gid, close to the bone, is forbidden mid'Oraisa. One who eats it is lashed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The outer Gid, close to the flesh, is forbidden mid'Rabanan. One who eats it is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 4:</span>c - Beraisa) : If one ate a k'Zayis of each Gid, he receives 80 lashes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he gets 40 lashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We understand this if R. Yehudah is sure. However, if he is unsure, why is he lashed? He received Hasra'as Safek (no one could warn him that what he is about to eat is surely forbidden)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We know that R. Yehudah disqualifies Hasra'as Safek;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If we are unsure if Reuven is the son of David or Moshe, and Reuven strikes or curses David and Moshe, one after the other or at the same time, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he is liable only if he struck or cursed both at the same time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, R. Yehudah is unsure. Our Tana holds (like the following Tana) that R. Yehudah says that Safek Hasra'ah is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "You may not leave over (from the Korban Pesach) until morning. You will burn what is left over" - the Torah gives a Mitzvas Aseh after the Lav, to exempt from lashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yakov):</span> No. One is not lashed because this Lav is not transgressed through an action, rather, through inaction.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> If one ate two Gidim from two animals, he receives 80 lashes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah obligates only 40 lashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Surely, both are (right Gidim, and) forbidden. If one was a left Gid, the Tana would discuss the simpler case of the two Gidim of one animal!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah must be sure. If not, he would exempt from lashes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Yehudah obligate only 40 lashes?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, each Gid is less than a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one eats a Gid ha'Nasheh that is less than a k'Zayis, he is lashed;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehudah exempts.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE FIGHT WITH THE ANGEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did R. Yehudah decide that the right Gid is forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> "Ha'Yarech" connotes the special thigh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim explain that this is the Gid that extends throughout the entire thigh, i.e. the inner Gid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> "(The angel) wrestled with (Yakov)" - like a man who embraces a man. His right hand reaches around to the other's right thigh. (Presumably, the angel's right hand injured Yakov.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> The angel (was walking towards Yakov. He) appeared to Yakov like a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If one encounters a Nochri on the road, he should position himself so that the Nochri is on his right side.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Acha):</span> The angel (was going in the same direction as Yakov. He) appeared like a Chacham. (Yakov positioned himself so the angel would be on Yakov's right side, to honor him);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If one walks to the right side of his Rebbi, he is boorish.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Chachamim forbid both Gidin. They say that the angel came from behind Yakov, and hit him on both thighs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from "He'avko (he wrestled) with him"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They explain like R. Yehoshua ben Levi, that the Avak (dust) went up from their feet to the Kisei ha'Kavod. (Rashba - this indicates that they fought about fundamentals of our belief. Their fight will persist until the Kisei will be complete, in the end of days.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> It is called the Gid ha'Nasheh because Nashah (it was dislocated) from its place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> "Slaughter and prepare" - (Yosef instructed Menasheh to) show (to his brothers) the slaughtered neck of the animal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"And prepare" - remove the Gid ha'Nasheh in front of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is like the opinion that Gid ha'Nasheh was forbidden before the Torah was given.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "And Yakov remained alone" - he remained to take small flasks.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that Tzadikim are more careful about their money than their bodies.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is because they are careful not to steal. (They fear to wax poor, lest they be temted to steal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "A man wrestled with him until the dawn" teaches that a Chacham should not go out alone at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> We learn from "Bo'az will winnow" (and stay in the granary. He would not go out alone at night.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">91b----------------------------------------91b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> We learn from "va'Yashkem Avraham ba'Boker." (Even though he was accompanied, he waited until morning. All the more so a Chacham should not go out alone at night!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> We learn from "Lech Na Re'e Es Shelom Achecha" (during the day, when one can see.).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>YAKOV'S DREAM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We learn from "The sun shone for him (so he could travel)."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Akiva):</span> why does it say "the sun shone for him"? It shines for the whole world!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> Previously, the sun had set early for him. Now, it rose early for him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Yakov... came to Charan... he encountered the place" - when he reached Charan, he regretted that he did not pray where his father and grandfather had prayed (at the Akeidah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He decided to return. Immediately, he miraculously encountered the place.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>After he prayed, he planned to resume traveling. Hash-m wanted him to spend the night there, so he made the sun set prematurely.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> It says "he took from the stones of the place", and it says "he took the stone"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> All the stones of the area gathered. Each asserted that Yakov should rest his head on it. They all fused together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He dreamed. A ladder was set on the ground" - the ladder was 8000 Parsa'os wide.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Angels were ascending and descending" - two were ascending and two descending. It follows that the ladder was wide enough to hold four (where they crossed);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Its (an angel's) body is like the Tarshish Sea", which is 2000 Parsa'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The angels ascended and gazed at Yakov's image on Hash-m's Merkavah. They descended and gazed at Yakov's image;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Yakov was in danger (because they were jealous). Therefore, "Hash-m stood over him."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Hash-m was like a father blowing a bellows so his son will not be hot. It would be forbidden to say this if not for the verse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "The land you are sleeping on (I will give to your seed)" is a very small promise!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> Hash-m folded up all of Eretz Yisrael under Yakov, and promised that it would be as easy to conquer as the four Amos under Yakov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>"(The angel) said 'send me, for dawn has come.'"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Yakov:</span> Are you a thief or kidnapper (Rashi; Tosfos - dice-player), therefore you are afraid to come out by day?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">The angel:</span> I am an angel. This is the first time it is my turn to sing (to Hash-m).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>This supports Rav Chananel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chananel):</span> Three groups of angels sing. One says "Kadosh". The next responds "Kadosh". The third responds "Kadosh Hash-m Tzevakos."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Yisrael are dearer to Hash-m than the angels. Yisrael sing constantly to Hash-m;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Opinions vary how often (any one) angel sings - once every day, or week, or month, or year, or seven years, or Yovel cycle, or only once.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Yisrael say Hash-m's Name after only two words - "Shma Yisrael, Hash-m... ";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Angels only say His Name after three words - "Kadosh, Kadosh, Kadosh, Hash-m Tzevakos" (this is unlike Rav Chananel.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Angels may not sing above until Yisrael sing below - "when the morning stars (Yisrael) sing together, (then) all angels will resound".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Chananel):</span> Rather, one group of angels says "Kadosh", the next responds "Kadosh, Kadosh", and the third responds "Kadosh, Kadosh, Kadosh, Hash-m Tzevakos."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also angels say His Name after two words - "Baruch Kevod Hash-m mi'Mekomo"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Ofanim say that, but not the regular (ministering) angels.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Once angels have permission to say His Name (after saying "Kadosh, Kadosh, Kadosh"), they no longer need to say three words before it.</p></div>
