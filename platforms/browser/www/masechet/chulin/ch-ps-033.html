<p class="dedicationbox">CHULIN 31-43 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE CONSEQUENCES OF CUTTING THE SIMANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> This is no proof that R. Zeira retracted. Perhaps he asked according to Rava, even though R. Zeira himself disagrees! (R. Zeira holds that the animal is Kosher (Rashi; Tosfos - Tereifah) no matter where the wound is.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> We may derive from Reish Lakish's law that a Yisrael may eat intestines, but a Nochri may not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because for a Yisrael, the Shechitah is necessary to permit the animal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Shechitah is not needed for a Nochri. It depends only on whether the animal is dead. (Once the Veshet is cut, we view the intestines as if they were removed). Therefore, for him, the intestines are forbidden, like Ever Min ha'Chai (a limb from a living animal), even after the animal later dies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> I thought to ask that that we never find something permitted to a Yisrael and forbidden to a Nochri!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>I did not ask, for Rav Acha gave a good reason why this is an exception.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> There is a way to eat meat taken from an animal before it died. After Shechitah, cut a piece from the place of Shechitah, salt it well and rinse it well. It is permitted after the animal dies, to Yisraelim and Nochrim. (This is unlike Rav Acha, who says that since Shechitah does not apply to Nochrim, it is Ever Min ha'Chai for them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This Beraisa supports Rav Idi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> It is very healthy to eat meat taken from an animal before it died. One cuts a piece from the place of Shechitah, and salts and rinses it well. After the animal dies it is permitted to Yisraelim and Nochrim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BLOODLESS SHECHITAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughtered a Behemah, Chayah or bird, and no blood came out, it may be eaten with Tamei hands, since the meat was not Huchshar (no liquid come upon it);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon says, Shechitah is Machshir the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> This implies that if blood came out, it may not be eaten with Tamei hands. Why is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tamei hands are only a Sheni l'Tumah (second-degree Tumah). They would not be Metamei the meat, for Chulin cannot become a Shelishi l'Tumah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the Mishnah discusses Chulin meat?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah includes Chayos, which cannot be Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Regarding Kodshim, we would not say they are Kosher if no blood came out. We must put the blood on the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Regarding Kodshim, even if blood came out, it is not Machshir;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> "You will spill (the blood) on the ground like water" teaches that only blood that is spilled like water is Machshir. (This excludes blood of Kodshim, which is collected and thrown on the Mizbe'ach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Regarding Kodshim, Chibas ha'Kodesh (a stringency of Kodshim) is Machshir the meat without any liquid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> The Mishnah discusses Chulin meat bought with money of Ma'aser Sheni. The Tana argues with R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Anyone who must immerse mid'Rabanan:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he touches Kodshim, it becomes Tamei. (If it touches other Kodshim, it disqualifies them). If he touches Terumah, it is Pasul. (It is Tamei, but it cannot disqualify other Terumah). Ma'aser Sheni is permitted to him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, Ma'aser Sheni is forbidden to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> Chachamim forbid him to eat Ma'aser Sheni. They do not say that he may not touch it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah says that the meat may be eaten with (i.e. using) Tamei hands. The case is, one with Tamei hands feeds it to a Tahor person! (Even Chachamim would permit this regarding Ma'aser Sheni, even if it was Huchshar.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TUM'AH OF HANDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah discusses hands that are a Rishon (first degree) l'Tumah, according to R. Shimon ben Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Hands are never a Rishon (l'Tumah) regarding Chulin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, they can be a Rishon regarding Chulin, and a Sheni regarding Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It cannot be that they become a Rishon regarding Chulin, but not regarding Terumah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means that they can become a Rishon even regarding Chulin. They can become a Sheni regarding Terumah, but not for Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can hands really become Rishon l'Tumah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> If one entered his hands into a house stricken with Tzara'as, they become a Rishon;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Chachamim say, they become a Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>All agree that partially entering is not considered entering. R. Akiva decrees that the hands are like the body would be if (the majority of) the body entered. Chachamim decree that his hands become like regular unguarded hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav Papa say that the Mishnah is R. Akiva?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva said that they are a Rishon only regarding Terumah. perhaps he does not say so regarding Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if R. Akiva says that they are a Sheni only regarding Chulin, he holds that they are Metamei the meat, for he holds that Chulin can become a Shelishi!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On that day (that R. Eliezer ben Azaryah was appointed Nasi), R. Akiva expounded "any earthenware Kli... Yitma (food inside becomes Tamei)".</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It does not say 'Tamei', rather "Yitma", to show that a loaf inside, which is a Sheni, can Metamei other food (make a Shelishi).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps he said so only regarding Tum'ah mid'Oraisa, but not for Tum'ah mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>CHULIN TREATED LIKE KODESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Elazar):</span> The Mishnah discusses Chulin Al Taharas (i.e. that one guards from Tum'ah like) Kodesh. It is unlike R. Yehoshua;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If one eats food that is a Rishon, Sheni or Shelishi l'Tumah, he becomes Tamei like the food he ate;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, if he ate a Rishon or Sheni, he becomes a Sheni. If he ate a Shelishi, he becomes a Sheni regarding Kodesh, but not regarding Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Shelishi he ate is Chulin Al Taharas Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Yehoshua discusses Chulin Al Taharas Terumah, but not Chulin Al Taharas Kodesh, for the latter cannot become a Shelishi.</p></div>
