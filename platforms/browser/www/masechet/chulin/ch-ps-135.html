<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>REISHIS HA'GEZ DOES NOT APPLY TO KODSHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reishis ha'Gez (first shearings) applies in Eretz Yisrael and in Chutz la'Aretz, whether or not the Mikdash stands. It applies to Chulin, but not to Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>There is a stringency of Matanos over Reishis ha'Gez. Matanos apply to cattle and flock, to a large or small number of animals, whereas Reishis ha'Gez applies only to sheep, and only to a large quantity:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai say, one who shears two sheep must give - "u'Shtei Tzon";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, one who shears five sheep must give - "v'Chamesh Tzon Asuyos";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Dosa ben Hurkanus says, he must give only if (each of) the five sheep yield(s) the weight of two (Rashi - one) and a half Manos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Chachamim say, he is liable for any amount (of wool).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One must give to the Kohen shearings that will weigh five Sela'im of Yehudah (which equals ten Sela'im in Galil) after they are cleaned, in order that the Kohen can make a small garment;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Titen Lo" - it must be a proper gift.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If he dyed the wool before giving it, he is exempt. If he merely cleaned it, he must give it. (This is not considered a change.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If one buys wool from (Rambam; Rashi - attached to) a Nochri's sheep, he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If Shimon buys wool attached to Reuven's sheep:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Reuven kept some for himself, he is liable; if not, Shimon is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Reuven had two kinds of sheep, some dark and some white, and he sold wool only of/on the dark ones, or if he sold only wool of/on the males, but not of the females, Reuven and Shimon both give.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why doesn't Reishis ha'Gez apply to Kodshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Tzoncha" (yours), and not Hekdesh's flock.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If not for this verse, we would obligate Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may not shear them - "v'Lo Sagoz Bechor Tzonecha"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That applies only to Korbanos. The verse exempts flock of Bedek ha'Bayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar taught that one may not shear or work with Kodshim of Bedek ha'Bayis!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only mid'Rabanan;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since mid'Oraisa one may shear them, if he does, he must give to a Kohen. (The verse teaches this is not so.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The wool is Hekdesh. He could not give it to a Kohen!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He could redeem it and then give it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that does not require Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah (to stand up the animal for evaluation before redemption) for Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to the opinion that requires Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah, how can we answer? (One cannot stand up the wool after it is detached!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Mani bar Patish):</span> The case is, the owner was Makdish his animal to Bedek ha'Bayis, excluding for its shearings;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that Reishis ha'Gez applies to such sheep. The verse exempts.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same applies if he made his animal a Korban, excluding its shearings! (Why did we say that the verse is needed only for Bedek ha'Bayis?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One may not shear a Korban, for this weakens it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same applies to Bedek ha'Bayis. Why may he shear it?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, one was was Makdish an animal to Bedek ha'Bayis, excluding its shearings and the weakness resulting from shearing. (He stipulated that he may shear it, even though this weakens it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same applies if he made his animal a Korban, excluding its shearings and the resulting weakness!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In a Korban, the Kedushah spreads, and the animal becomes fully Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> Regarding Korbanos, if one says "the leg of this animal is an Olah," the entire animal is an Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Even R. Meir argues (and says that only the leg is Kadosh) only when he was Makdish a non-vital limb. If he was Makdish a limb vital to life, all agree that the entire animal is Kadosh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> The case is, one was Makdish only the shearings of his animal to Bedek ha'Bayis;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> When he shears such sheep, he must redeem some of the wool and give it to a Kohen;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Gez Tzoncha Titen Lo" - the Torah commands only when you can give immediately after shearing, but not when you must redeem it in between.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE EXEMPTION OF PARTNERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rava learn from "Tzoncha"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Reishis ha'Gez applies to sheep of partners;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Ila'i exempts.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Ila'i's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Tzoncha" excludes sheep of partners.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Chachamim say, this exempts (only) partnership with a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Ila'i's source to exempt partnership with a Nochri?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha of the verse excludes this - "Reishis Degancha," but not a partnership with a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">(Implied question:</span> Why don't Chachamim learn like R. Ila'i?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They do not learn from there, because "Reishis" (written before "Gez") interrupts.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Ila'i learns from there, because the "Vav" ("v'Reishis") joins them.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">135b----------------------------------------135b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against R. Ila'i):</span> The Torah should not interrupt, and it would not need to join them!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Anwer:</span> The Torah interrupted because they are different. Terumah (Reishis Degancha) has Kedushah, but Reishis ha'Gez does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Chachamim do not learn like R. Ila'i, because they obligate taking Terumah from produce owned jointly with a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If a Yisrael and Nochri are partners in a field, all the produce is a mixture of Chulin (produce exempt from Terumah and Ma'aseros) and Tevel.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, the Yisrael's share of the produce is Tevel, and the Nochri's share is Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>These Tana'im argue only about whether we may rely on Bereirah (to say that the produce each partner takes really was his share), but all obligate produce owned jointly with a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Ila'i excludes any partnership, with a Yisrael or with a Nochri, from "Tzoncha."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Partnership with a Nochri is excluded because it is not exclusively "Tzoncha (your flock)." Similarly, partnership with a Yisrael is not exclusively "Tzoncha (yours, i.e. singular)"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim exclude only partnership with a Nochri, for he is exempt from the Mitzvah. (They hold that "Tzoncha" applies also to jointly owned flock.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>PARTNERS ARE LIABLE EVERYWHERE ELSE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> In the following cases, one might have thought that R. Ila'i exempts partners (Yisraelim). Really, he admits that they are liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Partners (in a field) need not take Terumah, because it says "Degancha", and not of partners;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Terumoseichem" obligates partners.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Degancha"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Degancha" excludes partnership with a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Partners (in a dough) need not take Chalah, because it is called Reishis, just like Reishis ha'Gez;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Arisoseichem" obligates partners.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even without "Arisoseichem," why would we learn from Reishis ha'Gez to exempt? We should learn from Terumah to obligate! (When there are two ways to learn, we adopt the stringent way.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, they are liable even without "Arisoseichem";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Arisosechem" teaches that the quantity of flour that is liable is the daily allotment of Man in the Midbar (the volume of 43 and a fifth eggs).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Partners (in a field) need not leave Pe'ah, because it says "Sadcha", but not of partners;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Uv'Kutzrechem" obligates partners.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Sadcha"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes partnership with a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Bechor of a jointly owned mother has no Kedushah, because it says "bi'Vekarcha uv'Tzoncha", but not of partners;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "U'Vechoros Bekarchem v'Tzonchem" teaches that it is Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "bi'Vekarcha uv'Tzoncha"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes partnership with a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Partners (in a house) need not affix a Mezuzah, because it says "Beisecha", but not of partners;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Lema'an Yirbu Yemeichem" obligates partners.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Beisecha"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Beisecha" teaches that a Mezuzah is placed on the right doorpost. (We read this like "Bi'asecha", the way one enters a house, with his right foot first.)</p></div>
