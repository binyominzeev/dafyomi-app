<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba, citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one ate Chelev of a living Terefah Behemah, he is Chayav (lashes) twice;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami (and R. Avahu), citing R. Yochanan):</span> He is Chayav three times.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, the animal became Terefah during birth (or before);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Ami holds that l'Evarim Omedes, so all three Isurim (Chelev, Ever Min ha'Chai, and Terefah) take effect simultaneously (at birth);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Chiya bar Aba holds that Lav l'Evarim Omedes, so only Chelev and Terefah take effect at birth;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>When the Chelev is later removed, the Isur Ever does not take effect, since it is already forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> All hold that Lav l'Evarim Omedes. They argue about whether the Isur Ever is Chal on the Isurim of Chelev and Terefah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Ami holds that it is. R. Chiya bar Aba holds that it is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> All hold that l'Evarim Omedes; the case is, it became Terefah after birth;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about whether the Isur Terefah is Chal on the Isur Ever Min ha'Chai.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Ami says that it is, just like it is Chal on the Isur Chelev;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Torah teaches that the Isurim of Nevelah and Terefah are Chal on Chelev (even though it is already forbidden).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Chiya bar Aba disagrees. They are Chal on Chelev, for Chelev has a leniency, i.e. the Chelev of a Chayah is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">103b----------------------------------------103b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Ever Min ha'Chai is never permitted, so the Isur Terefah is not Chal on it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>EVER MIN HA'CHAI THAT WAS DIVIDED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Dimi) Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If an Ever Min ha'Chai was cut, and then one ate it, is he liable?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> No.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If he put it whole in his mouth, and then divided it (he did not swallow it whole), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ravin):</span> If Ever Min ha'Chai was cut, and then one ate it, he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If he put it whole in his mouth, and then divided it, R. Yochanan is Mechayev, and Reish Lakish exempts.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan is Mechayev, because he enjoyed swallowing a k'Zayis (the Shi'ur to be liable);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish exempts. To be liable, a k'Zayis must enter his stomach together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Reish Lakish, how is one ever liable? (Surely, he chews before swallowing!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> A small bone (of the upper joint of the leg) can be swallowed whole.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Even if he divided it before putting it in his mouth, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though it was not connected, we do not consider it as if he only ate half.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> When one must eat a k'Zayis to be liable, food stuck between the teeth is not included;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is included.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Both agree that food stuck between the teeth is not included;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about food stuck in the palate. R. Yochanan includes it, for his throat tasted the food;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish excludes it, for his stomach did not benefit.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FOOD THAT WAS REGURGITATED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Asi, citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one ate half a k'Zayis of forbidden food (Rashi - Ever Min ha'Chai), regurgitated it, and ate a different half k'Zayis, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because he had the pleasure of swallowing a k'Zayis (in all.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar, of R. Asi):</span> If he ate half a k'Zayis of forbidden food, regurgitated it, and ate it again, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was R. Elazar unsure about?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he was unsure whether regurgitated food is considered digested (and is no longer forbidden), he should have asked about eating a k'Zayis of regurgitated food!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If he was unsure whether liability depends on swallowing or benefit of the stomach, he should have known this from R. Asi's law (above)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar had no doubt. R. Asi had forgotten his learning, and R. Elazar was helping him to remember.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He asked, why do you discuss eating a different half k'Zayis? You should teach about eating the same half k'Zayis again, to teach two laws!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>We would hear that regurgitated food is not considered digested, and that the criterion is pleasure of swallowing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Asi did not respond.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> Chacham of the generation! You yourself said in front of R. Yochanan 'he enjoyed swallowing a k'Zayis' (and he is liable for this).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not cook any kind of meat with milk, except for meat of fish and grasshoppers;</p></div>
