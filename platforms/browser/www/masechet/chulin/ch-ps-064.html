<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SIMANIM OF EGGS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we rely on his words? We should inspect the eggs!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Simanim of (Tahor) fish are just like Simanim of eggs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be! The Torah says that fish must have fins and scales!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Simanim of fish innards are just like Simanim of eggs;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Simanim of Tahor eggs is that one end is spherical, and the other end is pointed. If both ends are spherical, or both are pointed, they are Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If the egg white is on the outside, and the yolk is on the inside, they are Tahor. If it is vice-versa, they are Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>If the white and yolk are mixed together, they are eggs of a Sheretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, the eggs are cut. We do not know their full shape.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We can check the yolk and white!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to both questions):</span> The case is, the yolk and white are beaten together in a bowl.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We may not buy such eggs from a Nochri!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may not sell eggs of a Treifah to a Nochri, unless they are beaten in a bowl. Therefore, we may not buy beaten eggs from a Nochri (lest they are Treifah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Zeira):</span> The Simanim to distinguish Tamei eggs from Tahor are not mid'Oraisa, so we do not rely on them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> If the Simanim were mid'Oraisa, we would be able to resolve the eight doubtful species (62b), through inspecting their eggs!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we may not rely on the Simanim, why were they taught?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If they have the Simanim of Tahor eggs, we may trust even a Nochri if he says that they are a particular Tahor species. We may not rely on the Simanim alone, for raven eggs resemble dove eggs (and perhaps other Tamei eggs resemble Tahor eggs).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>EGGS OF SHERATZIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the white and yolk are mixed together, they are surely eggs of a Sheretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make? Whether they are of a Sheretz or a Tamei bird, we may not eat them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ukva bar Chama):</span> If a baby Sheretz started forming (and died), and there was a hole in the shell, one who touches the egg becomes Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Ravina):</span> Perhaps they are snake eggs (which resemble Sheretz eggs, but are Tehorim! Indeed, it is important to know that they are Safek Teme'im. However, the Beraisa says that they are surely Sheretz eggs!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> If a baby started forming and one (was warned and) ate it, he is lashed for eating a Sheretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One is lashed for eating a developing bird egg, even if it is Tahor!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Every Sheretz that swarms on the ground" includes chicks that did not yet open their eyes.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">64b----------------------------------------64b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Isur is only mid'Rabanan. One is not lashed for it mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Gi'ulei Beitzim (Rashi - eggs that were cooked with (and absorbed taste from) Tamei eggs; Tosfos - eggs that left the bird prematurely) are permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>One who is not particular (about what he eats) may eat unfertilized eggs that a hen sat on;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>If a drop of blood is found, the blood is discarded and the egg is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> This is only if the blood is found on the knot (of the egg white).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Dostoy, father of R. Aftoriki):</span> This is only if the blood is found on (the knot of) the egg white. If it is found on the yolk, the entire egg is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is because the blood spread throughout the egg.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Gavihah):</span> This law was said in front of Abaye, but reversed (the law of blood found on the white and yolk). Abaye corrected it to our version.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TAMEI EGGS ARE FORBIDDEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> "Bas ha'Ya'anah" forbids eggs of a Tamei bird;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We cannot say that only the young females are forbidden. Rather, it refers to eggs of a Tamei bird.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps 'Bas ha'Ya'anah' is the name of the bird, so we may not expound it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the name is Ye'enim - "ka'Yenim ba'Midbar."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "v'Evel ki'Vnos Ya'anah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to an ostrich mourning over its young.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "will dwell there Bnos Ya'anah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to an ostrich that dwells with its young.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "will honor Me... u'Vnos Ya'anah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This cannot mean eggs, for they cannot praise Hash-m!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah sometimes writes "ha'Ya'anah", and sometimes "Bas ha'Ya'anah";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since "Bas ha'Ya'anah" is written as two words, it refers to two things (the eggs and the birds).</p></div>
