<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DOES MEAT ON THE SKIN COMBINE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Alal... (if a k'Zayis is gathered in one place, it has Tum'as Nevelah. Rashi - also, one who eats it is liable.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This is only if he (the one who flayed the animal) gathered them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If two pieces of meat are on the skin, and each is half a k'Zayis, the skin is Mevatel them. (They are not like Nevelah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to which Tana (in the Mishnah 124a) is this teaching?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is unlike R. Yishmael. He holds that the skin is not Mevatel the meat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It cannot be like R. Akiva. He explicitly says that the skin is Mevatel the meat! (Surely, Rav Huna did not merely teach the Mishnah. If he wanted to teach that the Halachah follows R. Akiva, he should have explicitly said so.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Really, he holds like R. Yishmael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yishmael admits that the skin is Mevatel meat that comes off the knife when flaying the animal (since he leaves the meat there). That Mishnah discusses when a Chayah bit the animal, and some meat stuck to the skin. No person was Mevatel it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If a k'Zayis of Alal is gathered in one place, one is liable for it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This is only if he (the flayer) gathered it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Granted, if R. Yishmael holds that skin does not Mevatel meat, even if the meat came off a knife, then Rav Huna explains R. Yehudah like R. Yishmael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of objection:</span> However, if R. Yishmael admits (to R. Akiva) that skin is Mevatel meat that comes off a knife, R. Yehudah is not like either of these two Tana'im! (They hold that it is Batel. Even if he gathers it, it is not Nevelah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, Rav Huna holds like R. Akiva.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is his Chidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that R. Akiva said that skin is Mevatel meat only if it came off a knife;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Huna teaches that R. Akiva says this even if it came from a Chayah's bite.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We learn this from R. Akiva's words. He attributes the Bitul to the skin.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HUMAN SKIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following skins are (Tamei) like the flesh:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Skin of man, domestic pigs, the hump of tender (young) camels, and the head of tender calves;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding all animals, skin of the feet, womb, a fetus, and under the tail;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Skin of an Anakah (a porcupine, hedgehog or beaver?), praying mantis, lizard, and a slug.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah includes also (the skin of) a wild pig, but excludes a lizard, for it is like a rat. (Its skin is not Tamei.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Regarding all non-human skins, if it was tanned or trampled enough for tanning, it is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yochanan ben Nuri says, the skin of all eight Tamei Sheratzim is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara - Ula):</span> Mid'Oraisa, human skin is Tahor. Chachamim decreed that is Tamei, lest people make mats from their parents' skin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mishnah):</span> Regarding all non-human skins, if it was tanned or trampled enough for tanning, it is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Mid'Oraisa, tanned human skin is Tahor. Chachamim decreed that it is Tamei lest people make mats from their parents' skin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to Version #1, Ula surely agrees that tanned human skin is Tamei only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to Version #2, Ula holds that untanned human skin is Tamei mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ANIMAL SKINS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The skin of domestic pigs...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah includes skin of a wild pig because he he holds that it is soft. The first Tana holds that it is hard.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The hump of a tender camel...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long is it considered tender?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula citing R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> It is tender as long as it has not borne a burden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If it is old enough to bear a burden, but it has not done so, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Abaye):</span> If it is not old enough to bear a burden, but it did, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>These questions are unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Reish Lakish did not know how long is it considered tender. R. Yishmael bar Aba cited R. Yehoshua ben Levi's answer. Reish Lakish showed his gratitude.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>R. Zeira did not know how long is it considered tender. Ravin bar Chinena cited the above answer. He did not think that R. Zeira heard him, so he repeated it. R. Zeira scolded him for trying to show off his knowledge.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows the difference between great people of Eretz Yisrael (Reish Lakish) and the most pious of Bavel (R. Zeira).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The head of a tender calf...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long is it considered tender?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> It is tender for one year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is tender as long as it is nursing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did Ula mean that it is one year provided that it is nursing, and R. Yochanan said that it is as long as it is nursing (even past a year);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">122b----------------------------------------122b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Or, did Ula mean that it is one year even if it ceased nursing, and R. Yochanan said that it is one year only if it is still nursing?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan said "as long as it is nursing" (he increases the time), not "provided that it is nursing" (to diminish the time).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHICH SKINS ARE LIKE FLESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> Is the skin of the head of a tender calf Metamei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> You taught to us the Mishnah that the skin of the head of a tender calf is like the flesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The Mishnah is like an individual. The Halachah follows Chachamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If an Olah was slaughtered with intention to burn in the wrong place (i.e. not on the outer Mizbe'ach) the skin under the tail, the Korban is Pasul, but one who eats it is not Chayav Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he intended to burn it after the allotted time (that day), the Korban is Pigul, and one who eats it is Chayav Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Eliezer ben Yehudah says, Pasul and Pigul apply also to (improper intent to eat or burn) skin of the feet, skin of a tender calf's head, and skins that are Tamei like the flesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This comes to include skin of the womb in a female Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(The first Tana does not include the head of a tender calf, because he holds that it is not like the flesh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Skin of the feet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered skin of the feet?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It includes only the skin of the feet (up to the ankle).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina):</span> It includes all the skin up to the (lower) knee.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The skin of an Anakah...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ha'Teme'im" includes the skins (of Sheratzim. They are Tamei like the flesh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies to all eight Sheratzim listed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (It applies only to) "Eleh".</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Eleh" refers to all of them!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> "L'Minehu (and others in this species)" separates. ("Eleh" refers only to what is written after "l'Minehu".)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Mishnah should list also a mole, for also this is after "l'Mineihu"!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon bar Yitzchak):</span> Rav is considered a Tana. He argues with the Mishnah and includes a mole.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim (the first Tana) argue?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like R. Yehudah, who judges based on the feel of the skin (Rashi - to decide which skins are like the flesh; Tosfos - to decide to which skins "ha'Teme'im" refers).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span><p>They argue with R. Yehudah about a lizard. (Chachamim hold that its skin is like flesh.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>WHEN IS TRAMPLING METAHER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any skins that were tanned...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They are Tahor only if they were trampled on.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Chiya):</span> If a donkey's ear was used to patch a box, it is Tahor. (Rashi - similarly, placing skins where they will be trampled should suffice to be Metaher them! Tosfos - if our Tana agreed to this, he should have taught this case. It is a bigger Chidush!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An ear need not be trampled to patch a box. For other uses, trampling is required. (Tosfos - both Chidushim are equal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered "trampled enough for tanning"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> It is the time to walk four Mil (one Mil is 2000 Amos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu citing Reish Lakish):</span> Four Mil is the Shi'ur for the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kneading (Rashi - One who was hired to knead a dough b'Taharah must walk four Mil to immerse Kelim (without extra compensation); Tosfos - one who wants to hire someone to knead his dough should walk four Mil to get someone who will do this b'Taharah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Prayer (one must walk four Mil in order to pray with a Tzibur - Rashi;Tosfos - in order to immerse from Tum'as Keri before praying);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Washing the hands (one must walk four Mil in order to get water to wash before eating).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Eibo said this, and not R. Avahu. He included a fourth case, trampling skins (in our Mishnah).</p></div>
