<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>GIVING A LEG TO A NOCHRI (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> One may send only a whole leg, but not a piece with the Gid inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (In this place) they do not announce in the meat market when an animal is found to be Terefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, one may send even a piece, for a Yisrael may never buy from a Nochri (lest it is a Terefah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (In this place) they announce when an animal was found to be Terefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, one should not send even a whole leg, lest the Nochri cut it and a Yisrael will buy a piece!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can explain the Mishnah in either place;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Where they announce, we are not concerned lest the Nochri cut it and a Yisrael will buy a piece, for one can recognize the way Yisraelim cut meat to remove the Gid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In a place where they do not announce, Chachamim forbid Reuven to send a piece to a Nochri (without removing the Gid), lest another Yisrael see (and assume that it is permitted), and buy it from the Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Alternatively, it is forbidden because due to deception. (The Nochri thinks that Reuven gave him something that Reuven himself would eat.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may not deceive people, even Nochrim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Shmuel did not say this explicitly. It was inferred from something he said;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel was on a ferry. He asked his servant to pay the ferryman. He was disturbed by the way his servant did this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was he upset?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> His servant gave the ferryman a Terefah chicken under the pretense that it was Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Shmuel told him to give the ferryman Anafka (undiluted wine), and he gave him diluted wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make whether or not Shmuel explicitly forbade deceiving?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps he was upset for a different reason;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to Abaye, perhaps Shmuel was upset that his servant was keeping around a Terefah chicken. Perhaps someone would come to eat it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to Rava, perhaps he was upset that his servant did not give Anafka, like he was told.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DECEPTION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One should not insist that his friend Reuven eat by him, if he knows that Reuven will refuse;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He should not insist that he wants to give him a gift, if he knows that Reuven will not accept;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one opens barrels of wine in honor of a guest, and he already agreed to sell them to a grocer, he must inform the guest. (Usually, opening a barrel of wine causes a loss, for the wine will not last long. In this case, there is no loss. The grocer will sell it quickly.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One should not give an empty flask to a guest and offer him to anoint;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If these are done to honor the guest in front of others, it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ula visited Rav Yehudah, and Rav Yehudah opened barrels that he had sold to a grocer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav Yehudah informed Ula.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav Yehudah loved Ula so much that he would have opened them even if they were not sold.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should not go to a mourner's house with a half-empty flask, nor should he fill it with water, for he deceives him (he thinks that it is full of wine);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may do this to honor the mourner in front of many people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not sell a sandal made from the hide of a Nevelah under the pretense that it is from a slaughtered animal, for two reasons:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is deception;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is dangerous. (Perhaps the Nevelah was bitten by a snake. The venom might damage the wearer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>One should not send a barrel of wine with oil floating on top.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> A man once received such a barrel. He invited guests (for he thought that he had oil);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When he saw that he had no oil to serve them, he killed himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (according to Avos d'R. Noson):</span> A man once received such a barrel. (He was told that it is wine.) He invited guests to drink.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When he saw the oil at the top, he thought that there was a mistake, and that he had no wine to serve them. He killed himself. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>A guest may not give his portion to the host's children without permission.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Once, Ploni invited three guests at a time of famine. Each gave his meager portion to Ploni's son. Ploni saw his son eating one of them and holding the other two. He hit him, and the son died. His mother then took her own life, and Ploni did the same.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHAT ONE MAY GIVE TO A NOCHRI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sends a thigh to a Yisrael, he need not remove the Gid. If he sends a piece, he must remove it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he sends to a Nochri, in either case he need not remove the Gid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We do not sell Nevelos or Terefos to Nochrim for two reasons;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is deception;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Perhaps they will resell it to a Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One should not give money to a Nochri to buy meat for two reasons;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">94b----------------------------------------94b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps he will take the meat and not pay the money;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Perhaps the butcher will give him a Terefah or Nevelah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa permits sending a thigh or a piece to a Nochri without removing the Gid. What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is a place where they announce (when there is a Terefah in the market).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since they did not announce today, Yisraelim might buy meat from Nochrim. One should have to remove it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is a place where they do not announce.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The next clause forbids selling Nevelos or Terefos to Nochrim for two reasons - deception, and lest they resell it to a Yisrael. What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be a place where they do not announce, for there Yisraelim never buy meat from Nochrim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is a place where they announce.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> One should not give money to a Nochri to buy meat for two reasons. Perhaps he will take the meat without paying, and lest the butcher give him a Terefah or Nevelah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is a place where they announce.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, we need not worry lest they give to him a Terefah, since there was no announcement today!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is a place where they do not announce.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are the Reisha and Seifa in places where they don't announce, and the middle clause is in a place where they do?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Correct!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The entire Beraisa is in a place where they announce;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In the Reisha and Seifa, there was an announcement that day. In the middle case, there was not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> The entire Beraisa is in a place where they do not announce;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The middle case is a decree, lest a Yisrael (Reuven) see a Nochri buy meat from a Yisrael. Reuven will assume that it is Kosher. He might buy the meat from the Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they announce when there is a Terefah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> They say, there is meat for the Nochrim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't they say 'there is a Terefah for the Nochrim'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, they would not buy it (since they know that it is unfit for us).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The text we announce deceives them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, they deceive themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mar Zutra bar Rav Nachman was traveling. He encountered Rav Safra and Rava.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Mar Zutra:</span> You did not need to come so far to greet me!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Safra:</span> Really, we didn't know that you were coming. Had we known, we would have come further to greet you!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava (to Rav Safra):</span> Why did you say that? It will make him feel bad.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Safra:</span> If not, we would have tricked him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> No, he tricked himself.</p></div>
