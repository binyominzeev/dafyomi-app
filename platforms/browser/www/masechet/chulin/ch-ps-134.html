<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen told a Yisrael "I sell my animal to you, except for the Matanos," Matanos need not be given.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #1):</span> If a Kohen sold his animal to a Yisrael "on condition that I get the Matanos," the Yisrael may give to any Kohen he wants.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Saying "except" is not like saying "on condition that";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Except" limits the sale. "On condition that" does not limit the sale!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (to Beraisa #1 - Beraisa #2):</span> If a Kohen sold his animal to a Yisrael "on condition that I get the Matanos," he gets the Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> This Tana holds that "on condition that" limits the sale (the Matanos were never sold). Tana #1 holds that it does not limit the sale.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven bought the innards of Shimon's cow (by weight, he gives the stomach to a Kohen, and does not pay for its weight).</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav holds that they can be stolen. Rav Asi disagrees. (Tosfos - now, we explain like Rashi did. Rav allows the Kohen to claim from either. Rav Asi says that he can claim only from Reuven.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav):</span> Matnos Kehunah can be stolen. (He said so explicitly. We did not need to infer it from his explanation of the Mishnah);</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SAFEK MATANOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> If a Nochri converted, and he has a slaughtered cow:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was slaughtered before he converted, he is exempt from Matanos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was slaughtered after he converted, he is obligated;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara - Reish Lakish) Inference:</span> If we are unsure, he is exempt. We are lenient;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #2):</span> If grain was found in an anthole in a place that was not yet harvested, the landowner (Reuven) keeps it. (Leket is only what falls during harvesting);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was found in an anthole in a place that was already harvested --</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>What rests on top must be left for the poor. (Tosfos - perhaps it is Leket);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Reuven keeps what is inside the holes. (Presumably, ants brought it there before the harvest);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir says, even what is inside must be left for the poor, because Safek Leket is considered Leket. (Rashi - our anonymous Mishnah (#1) should be like R. Meir! Tosfos - even Chachamim are stringent about a Safek, when it is on top.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Mishnah #2 is an individual's (R. Yehudah ben Agra's) opinion. The proper version is like our Mishnah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah ben Agra citing R. Meir):</span> Safek Leket is considered Leket; the same applies to Shichechah and Pe'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> No matter who taught Mishnah #2, he has a powerful support!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> Question: What is the meaning of "Oni va'Rash Hatzdiku"?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot mean to vindicate the poor - "v'Dal Lo Sehedar b'Rivo"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, give to him what you were entitled to keep (if not for this verse).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Chazakah is that Leket must be left from the grain, but (until the Nochri converts) the cow is exempt from Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri converted, and he has a dough:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was kneaded before he converted, he is exempt from separating Chalah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was kneaded after he converted, he must separate Chalah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If we are unsure, he must separate.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> One may not eat without separating Chalah. We must be stringent about a Safek Isur. Matanos are only a monetary privilege of the Kohen. One need not give them due to Safek.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> There are eight such doubts (whether something happened before or after conversion). We are stringent in four (cases of Isurim), and lenient in four (cases involving only money):</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If we are unsure whether a woman gave birth before or after she converted, she must bring a Korban. (she may not eat Kodshim before bringing it);</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>If we are unsure whether a firstborn donkey was born before or after the owner converted, he may not benefit from it until he designates a Seh to redeem it;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>If we are unsure whether a firstborn calf or Seh was born before or after the owner converted, it is a Safek Bechor. He must wait for it to get a blemish, and then he may eat it.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">134b----------------------------------------134b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In these four doubts we are lenient:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If we are unsure whether sheep were sheared or an animal was slaughtered before or after the owner converted, he need not give shearings/Matanos to a Kohen;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If we are unsure whether a (firstborn) boy was born before or after his mother converted, he need not be redeemed;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>When a convert specifies a Seh to redeem a firstborn donkey (like above), he need not give the Seh to a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ravin):</span> Reish Lakish asked a contradiction between Mishnah #2, which obligates leaving Safek Leket, and a Beraisa that exempts.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Terumah is different, because it is Tovel (forbids eating the produce until it is separated).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Matanos are not Tovel, yet one may not eat them for free in the absence of Kohanim!</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rif (Beraisa):</span> Even in a place where people are Moleg calves, one may not be Moleg the Zero'a, for this harms the skin. (The Torah obligates us to give the skin to a Kohen). (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>In a place where people flay the head, one must give the jaw with its skin;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>If no Kohen is around, he sets aside the value of the Matanos and eats them (lest they spoil), and gives the money to the first Kohen he finds.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Matanos to a Kohen are different, for the Torah obligates one to give them.	(This suggests another answer to Question (c).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Terumah is different, for the Torah obligates one to give it.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHICH PARTS ARE GIVEN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Zero'a is given. This is (the upper two bones of the foreleg,) from the lower knee to the shoulder;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The same is cooked and given to a Kohen from Eil Nazir;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava taught (regarding Gid ha'Nasheh) that "ha'Yerech" denotes the special (right) thigh. Similarly, "ha'Zero'a" is the special (right) Zero'a.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One must give the Chelev on and in the stomach.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> Kohanim are generous. They allow Yisrael to keep the Chelev on and in the stomach.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If not for their generosity, Yisraelim would have to give it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Expounders explain that the Matanos correspond to Pinchas' actions to kill Zimri and Kozbi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Zero'a is for taking a spear in his hand. (Surely, it was his right hand). The jaw is for praying. The stomach is for stabbing them through their stomachs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> "Shok ha'Yamin" - the right hind leg (of a Shelamim is given to the Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the Zero'a of Kodshim (of Eil Nazir) is the right Zero'a?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Titenu" (in the Parshah of Shok) is extra, to teach about the Zero'a of Kodshim.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa is R. Chanina ben Antigonus, who permits Shechitah above the Pikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Hagramah (cutting the Simanim outside the proper place) is invalid Shechitah;</p></div>
