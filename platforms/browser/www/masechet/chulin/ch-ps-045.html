<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HOLES IN THE KANEH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If the Kaneh is riddled with holes, like a sieve, if the combined size is the majority of the width, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah - Mishnah):</span> If a skull has a long thin hole, or small holes, if the combined area is the area of a drill bit, (it is considered incomplete, so) it does not have Tum'as Ohel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that small holes join up to the size of a single hole (which would inhibit Tum'as Ohel);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Also in the Kaneh, small holes should join up to the size of an Isar (a coin) to make it Tereifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The questioner did not realize that Rav Yehudah discusses punctures without Chisaron (no tissue of the Kaneh is missing);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> If there are holes with Chisaron, if the total area is like an Isar, it is Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the punctures are without Chisaron, if they join up to the majority of the width of the Kaneh, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> If a strip was removed from the Kaneh, if its total area is like an Isar, the animal is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak bar Nachmani):</span> If it is riddled with holes like a sieve, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Holes with Chisaron join to the size of an Isar. Punctures without Chisaron join up to the majority of the width of the Kaneh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law regarding birds?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Nachmani):</span> One cuts off the area surrounding the holes. If this covers the majority of the opening of the Kaneh, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If a piece of the Kaneh is cut but still attached (like a swinging door), if an Isar could go through (widthwise), it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If it is cracked (lengthwise), if one Chulya (ring; Rashi - three rings) on each end remains intact, it is not Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and R. Yonason):</span> As long as the crack does not extend to either end, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Yosef):</span> The entire Kaneh is valid for Shechitah, from the big (top) ring until the branching of the lungs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The bottommost ring is where the animal can bend its neck when it grazes, as long as one does not pull the Kaneh from its normal place.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanina):</span> If the animal stretches out its Kaneh by itself, is this Kosher for Shechitah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> If one pulled the Kaneh and slaughtered, it is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Kaneh was punctured below the chest, the law of lungs applies. (A puncture of any size makes it Tereifah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Chazeh (chest) of a Shelamim (that is given to Kohanim) is what faces the ground, from the neck until the Keres;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One (Rashi; Tosfos - two) ribs from each side are also given.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the membrane around the brain is punctured (it is Tereifah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav and Shmuel):</span> Even if only the outer membrane is punctured, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav and Shmuel):</span> It is Tereifah only if the inner membrane is (also) punctured.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> There are similar membranes surrounding the testicles.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> This applies to the part of the brain in the skull (a puncture of any size makes it Tereifah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>From where it leaves the skull towards the spinal cord, the law of the spinal cord applies (it is Tereifah only if the majority is cut).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered 'leaving the skull'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Nachmani):</span> There are two bean-shaped glands where the neck joins the skull. Within the glands (towards the brain) is like the brain. Outside them is like the spinal cord;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is even with the glands, I am unsure.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Presumably, it is like the brain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Yirmeyah found these glands in a bird.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TEREIFOS OF THE HEART</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the heart was punctured, reaching to the interior.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Does this mean to any interior chamber, or only to the innermost chamber?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> R. Shimon says, only if (the lung) is punctured to the branches;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Tachlifa):</span> This means to the central branch.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is no proof. That Mishnah says 'to the place of the branches, the place to which all branches flow;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Our Mishnah says 'to its interior.' (Perhaps) this means even a small chamber!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Any puncture in Kaneh ha'Lev (this will be explained) makes it Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is Tereifah only if the majority is cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Kaneh ha'Lev?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Yitzchak):</span> It is Chelev on the ribs (Rashi; Ra'avad - Chelev of the heart, chest and Kaneh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, cutting this does not make it a Tereifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, it is a branch of fat between the lungs that connects to the heart (Rambam - the artery from the heart to the lungs).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> There are three major Kanim - one (artery) emanating from the heart, one (the windpipe) from the lungs, and one from the liver (that returns blood from the body to the heart. The Rambam says so. Some explain that this is also Rashi's opinion. The simple reading of Rashi is incompatible with what is found through dissection.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The branch that goes to the lungs is like the lungs (any puncture makes it Tereifah). The branch to the liver is like the liver (if anything remains, it is not Tereifah). Rav and Shmuel argued (above) about the branch to the heart.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar bar Chiya):</span> No. The branch that goes to the lungs is like the liver. The branch to the liver is like the lungs. Rav and Shmuel argued about the branch to the heart.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TREIFOS OF THE SPINAL CORD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the spinal cord was broken...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If the majority of the spinal cord was snapped, it is Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yakov says, even if it was punctured. (it is Tereifah)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A case occurred, and Rebbi ruled like R. Yakov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah is not like R. Yakov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What majority does Rebbi require?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav):</span> It is the majority of the 'skin' (outer membrane) of the cord.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rav):</span> It is the majority of the interior.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Version #2 surely admits that if the majority of the skin is cut, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Version #1, if the majority of the interior is cut, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Niyuli taught that only the skin matters. The interior makes no difference.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Noson bar Avin was checking for the majority of the skin and of the interior.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav:</span> The interior makes no difference.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> If the cord became so watery that it flows, or Nismasmes (so soft that it cannot stand), it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If it cannot stand due to its weight, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Bei Rav):</span> If the cord became Nismasmes, it is Tereifah; if it was Nismazmez (part of the interior flowed out), it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> If the interior of the cord was Nismazmez, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The text of the Beraisa should say 'Nismasmes'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Levi saw a man bang his head, Levi lamented, 'His brain was Nismazmez'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He lamented that the man will die.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> No, he lamented that the man cannot have children.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How far down does this law of the spinal cord apply (that cutting the majority makes it Tereifah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It applies until between the branches.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>Rav Dimi bar Yitzchak wanted to show where this is.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In a fat animal, he could not show this precisely without tearing it out.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In a thin animal, the hip pressed the flesh into the cord, and the cord was not recognizable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He cited what Shmuel said, 'until the first (area between the branches), if the majority is cut, it is Tereifah. At the third, it is Kosher. I do not know the law of the second.'</p></div>
