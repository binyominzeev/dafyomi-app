<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE INTENT OF A MINOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Aba:</span> R. Yochanan had no doubt about mere intent (it has no effect, like the Mishnah clearly says);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He was unsure about intent recognized through his actions, e.g. if an Olah was in the south part of the Azarah, and he took it to the north (where it must be slaughtered) and slaughtered it.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Does this prove that he intended to slaughter it like a Korban?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, perhaps he just did not find room to slaughter in the south?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan already taught the law of intent recognized through actions!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven took his produce up to the roof so the mites will leave it, and dew came on it, since he did not intend for it to get wet, it is not Huchshar (able to receive Tum'ah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he wanted it to get wet, it is Huchshar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If a Cheresh, lunatic or minor took it up, even if he intended, it is not Huchshar.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If he flipped the produce over so the other side will get wet, it is Huchshar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was unsure if it takes effect mid'Oraisa or mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Version #2 - Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - (R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan) Question: Does the action of a minor take effect?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Ami):</span> He should ask whether a minor's intent takes effect!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Surely, he knew the Mishnah that teaches that a minor's intent has no effect. The same Mishnah teaches that his actions take effect!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was unsure if his actions take effect mid'Oraisa or mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> His actions take effect mid'Oraisa; his intent has no effect, even mid'Rabanan;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When his intent is recognized through actions, this has effect only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel):</span> What is the source that if Kodshim are slaughtered without intent, they are Pesulim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> "He will slaughter the bull" teaches that when slaughtering, he must intend for the bull.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel):</span> I knew that. I ask what is the source that if he did not, b'Di'eved, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> "You will slaughter it willingly" - you will slaughter it knowingly. (The extra verse teaches that b'Di'eved, it is Pasul.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SHECHITAH OF A NOCHRI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri slaughters, the animal is a Neveilah, and it has Tum'as Masa (one who moves it becomes Tamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> It is Neveilah, but one may benefit from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is our Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya b'Rebbi Aba):</span> It is not like R. Eliezer. He holds that (we assume that) a Nochri is always thinking about idolatry. (His Shechitah is for the sake of idolatry).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> The Mishnah says that if a Nochri slaughters, the animal is a Neveilah, but if a priest (of idolatry) slaughtered, the animal is (assumed to be) an offering to idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>From our Mishnah, we derive the same law that a Beraisa teaches;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a priest (of idolatry) slaughters, the animal is an offering to idolatry;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>His bread is forbidden like bread of Kusim; his wine is Yayin Nesech (a libation to idolatry); if he wrote Seforim (of Torah, Nevi'im or Kesuvim) they are like the prophecies of idolaters; his produce is (assumed to be) Tevel;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Some say, his children are Mamzerim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>The first Tana holds that he does not allow his wife to have relations with others.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri slaughters, the animal is a Neveilah (but one may benefit from it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We should be concerned lest he is a priest!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> There are not priests among the Nochrim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We see that there are!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, most Nochrim are not priests.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Nachman holds like R. Chiya bar Aba.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Nochrim in Chutz La'aretz are not true idolaters. They merely continue the customs of their ancestors.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef bar Minyomi):</span> There are not priests among the Nochrim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding what law was this taught?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It was taught regarding Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We forbid Shechitah even of a Yisrael who is a priest to idolatry, and all the more so of a Nochri priest!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We do not push him into a pit when the opportunity arises.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We push even a Yisrael who is a priest to idolatry, and all the more so, a Nochri priest!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2: (Rav Ukva bar Chama):</span> We accept Korbanos from him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "From you" connotes not from all of you, to exclude a Mumar. "From you (Yisrael)" teaches that within Yisrael there is a distinction (from whom we take Korbanos), but not among Nochrim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the verse teaches that we take Korbanos from Tzadikim within Yisrael, but not from the wicked, but we do not take from any Nochri!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> (The repetition) "Ish Ish" includes Nochrim, to teach that they may vow and bring Nedarim and Nedavos like Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TUM'AH OF ITEMS OFFERED TO IDOLS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It has Tum'as Masa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious. Every Neveilah has Tum'as Masa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah teaches that this animal has Tum'as Masa. This implies that another case has Tum'as Ohel, i.e. something offered to idolatry, according to R. Yehudah ben Beseirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah teaches that Shechitah of a Nochri has only Tum'as Masa. It does not have Tum'as Ohel, even if it was slaughtered to idolatry. This is unlike R. Yehudah ben Beseirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah ben Beseirah) Question:</span> What is the source that something offered to idolatry has Tum'as Ohel?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "They clung to Ba'al Pe'or, and ate of the Korbanos to the dead" equates idolatry and the dead;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like a corpse has Tum'as Ohel, also offerings to idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SHECHITAH WITHOUT SEEING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughters at night, or if a blind person slaughters, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> 'If one slaughters' is b'Di'eved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> One may slaughter anytime, and anywhere, by day or at night, on the roof or the head of a ship.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It is permitted at night by the light of a torch.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi):</span> In the Mishnah, the case of at night resembles the other case, i.e. a blind person, who cannot see;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In the Beraisa, the case of at night resembles the other case, i.e. by day, when he can see.</p></div>
