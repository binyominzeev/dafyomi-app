<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MULTIPLE LASHES FOR MULTIPLE TRANSGRESSIONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one ate two Gidim from two animals, he receives 80 lashes;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he gets only 40 lashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he was warned, ate one, was warned, and ate the other, R. Yehudah would agree that he gets 80 lashes!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he ate them together, with only one Hasra'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the first Tana?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is not Chachamim of Sumchus. They obligate only 40 lashes even in a case of Gufim Muchlakim, and all the more so here!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is Sumchus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, he was warned separately before eating each;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Above we said that also R. Yehudah should obligate 80 lashes. This assumed that each Gid was a k'Zayis;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is not the case.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one eats a full Gid that is less than a k'Zayis, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he is liable only if he eats a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN ONE MUST BE CONCERNED FOR OSO V'ES BENO?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are four times when one who sells an animal must tell the buyer if he sold its mother or child to be slaughtered that same day: Erev Simchas Torah, Erev Pesach, Erev Shavu'os, Erev Rosh Hashanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Gelili adds Erev Yom Kipur in Galil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if the mother or child was sold the previous day, he need not tell the buyer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah admits that if the mother was sold to a Chasan and the child to his Kalah, he must inform the latter buyer, for surely they intend to slaughter on the same day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>At these four times, one who paid for meat from an animal (to be slaughtered) can force the butcher to slaughter it, even if the animal is expensive and only a small amount of meat was bought;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, if the animal dies, the buyer loses what he paid (since he acquired part of the animal).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>At other times, one cannot force the butcher to slaughter it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, if the animal dies, the butcher suffers the loss himself. (The animal still belongs to him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If the seller didn't say anything, the buyer may slaughter on the day he buys.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah says...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he say 'the mother to the Chasan and the child to the Kalah'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that it is proper that the Chasan prepare more than the Kalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> At these four times...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The buyer only gave money. How did he acquire part of the animal without Meshichah (pulling it to his property?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> The case is, he did Meshichah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, we should always force the butcher to slaughter, and the buyer should lose if the animal died!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Shmuel bar R. Yitzchak):</span> Really, the buyer did not do Meshichah. Rather, someone else acquired on behalf of the buyer (without being asked to do so);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>At the four times, it is a Zechus (advantageous) to buy meat. Therefore someone else can acquire for the buyer, even if the buyer did not request it in advance. (It is valid only if the buyer consents when he finds out);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>At other times, it is a Chov (disadvantageous) for the buyer. The acquisition works only if the buyer requested in advance.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Elazar):</span> At these four times, Chachamim lifted their enactment, and allowed money to acquire (meat):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Mid'Oraisa, money acquires Metaltelim. Chachamim said that Meshichah works (and not money), lest a fire erupt in the seller's premises, and the seller will be sloth to save what he sold.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN THE DAY STARTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Regarding Oso v'Es Beno,) the day starts at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Zoma says, it says "one day", regarding creation and Oso v'Es Beno;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like the days of creation start at night, also regarding Oso v'Es Beno.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Zoma):</span> Oso v'Es Beno is written in the Parshah of Kodshim. For Kodshim, the day starts in the morning;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that also for Oso v'Es Beno, the day starts in the morning. Therefore, it says "one day", like it says regarding creation, to teach that it starts at night.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">83b----------------------------------------83b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi says, "one day" refers to a special day that must be announced;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is the source that one who sells an animal at one of the four times must tell the buyer if he sold its mother or child.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK KISUY HA'DAM</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>KISUY HA'DAM OF KODSHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kisuy ha'Dam (the Mitzvah to cover blood of Shechitah) applies in Eretz Yisrael and Chutz La'aretz, when the Mikdash stands and when it does not,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It applies to Chulin, but not to Kodshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It applies to fowl and Chayos, whether or not they belong to the Shochet;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It applies to a Koy, because we are in doubt if it is a Chayah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One may not slaughter a Koy on Yom Tov. If it was slaughtered, we do not do Kisuy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why doesn't it apply to Kodshim (i.e. Melikah of Korbanos ha'Of, which is in place of Shechitah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It does not apply due to R. Zeira's law:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> "He will cover it in earth" teaches that earth must be put below (so the blood falls on it) and above (after the blood fell).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This cannot be done for Melikah (which is done on the Mizbe'ach)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the earth will be left permanently on the Mizbe'ach, it will be Batel to (and considered part of) the Mizbe'ach, and the Mizbe'ach will be too big - "ha'Kol bi'Chsav mi'Yad Hash-m Alai Hiskil"! (Hash-m specified the size of everything in the Mikdash.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If the earth will be removed later, it would be considered an interruption between the blood and the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if the blood cannot be covered from below, it can be covered above!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yonason ben Yosef):</span> If a Chayah was slaughtered and a Behemah was slaughtered over it (and its blood fell on the Chayah's blood), no other cover is needed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a Behemah was slaughtered and a Chayah was slaughtered over it, the (Chayah's) blood must be covered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Dam Kodshim cannot be covered from below, there is no Mitzvah to cover it above;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> If a Minchah could have been mixed, mixing is not Me'akev. If it could not have been mixed (e.g. it is too big), mixing is Me'akev (so it is Pasul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should scrape the blood off the Mizbe'ach, and then cover it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Blood that spurted far away and blood on the knife must be covered.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One must scrape the blood off the knife to cover it. Likewise, we should scrape the blood off the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
