<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TO WHOM WE GIVE MATANOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If a Kohen denies that Hash-m commanded about the Avodah, he gets no share in Kodshim - "ha'Makriv... Lo Tihyeh... l'Manah."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches only that he must admit to Holachah (bringing the blood to the Mizbe'ach). What is the source that he must admit to the other 15 Avodos, i.e.:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>(Regarding a Minchah) putting on oil, mixing (the oil and the flour), breaking it into fine pieces, salting, Tenufah (waving), bringing close to the Mizbe'ach, taking a Kometz;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Haktarah (burning on the Mizbe'ach), Melikah (cutting a bird's Simanim with the fingernail), Kabalah (receiving blood of Shechitah), sprinkling blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Giving a Sotah to drink, beheading Eglah Arufah, Taharas Metzora, and giving Birkas Kohanim in and outside the Mikdash?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mi'Bnei Aharon" includes all the Avodos of Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A Kohen who admits to all the Avodos has a share of Kodshim, even if he is not fluent in them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> One may not eat the veins in the jaw (because they are full of blood). If a Kohen does not know to remove them, we do not give to him the jaw.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We give to him. He will not eat forbidden blood!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he roasts the jaw, the blood will flow out;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he cooks it, the blood will come out when he cuts the veins and salts the meat!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>KOHANIM SHOULD NOT GRAB MATANOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Is it proper to grab Matanos (from children bringing them to Kohanim) to show appreciation of the Mitzvah, or is this a disgrace?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is wrong. "V'Nasan" (teaches that Yisre'elim give to him) - he should not take by himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye (who was a Kohen):</span> I used to take by myself. After I heard the above teaching, I stopped taking, but I would ask for Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "Va'Yitu Acharei ha'Botza" - Shmuel's sons would ask for Ma'aser (and the verse denounces this)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> After I heard this, I stopped asking, but I would take if people gave to me.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The modest Kohanim would refrain from taking (Lechem ha'Panim. When the Berachah in the Lechem ha'Panim ceased, there was not enough for all the Kohanim. The gluttonous Kohanim would grab it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> After I heard this, I stopped taking. I take only on Erev Yom Kipur, so people will know that I am a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Giving Birkas Kohanim would suffice to publicize that he is a Kohen!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Abaye could not give Birkas Kohanim. (Rashi - he was busy teaching, and could not go to the Beis ha'Keneses at that time. Aruch - digestive problems prevented him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If a Kohen knows a poor Chacham, he may authorize the Chacham to receive (and eat) Matanos on his behalf.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Kohen is popular and many people give to him, the Matanos may be given directly to the Chacham.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Rava and Rav Safra visited Mar Yuchna. He slaughtered a choice calf for them. Rava asked his (Rashi - Mar Yuchna's; Magen Avraham - Rava's) attendant, who was a Kohen "let us take the jaw on your behalf, so we can eat it with mustard." (Rashi - Rava was a Kohen, but he held (like Abaye) that a Kohen should not request Matanos. Tosfos - Rava was not a Kohen.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>The servant agreed. Rava ate, but Rav Safra did not. Rav Safra was shown in a dream "worn out clothing on a cold day... v'Shar ba'Shirim Al Lev Ra" (it does not help to teach people who do not understand).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Safra (to Rav Yosef):</span> Was I shown this because I did not follow your teaching?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> No. I said only that a Kohen may choose to give to a Chacham, but surely this servant was afraid to refuse!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Also, I permit only a poor Chacham. That was not the case here!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Safra:</span> If so, why was I shown this verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> It was to rebuke Rava.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rava have the dream?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was estranged from Heaven (due to what he did).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What is the simple meaning of the verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> It does not help to teach an improper Talmid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One who teaches an improper Talmid falls to Gehinom. It says "...Te'achlehu Esh... Yera Sarid b'Ahalo";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Sarid" refers to Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Teaching an improper Talmid is like throwing a rock at the idol Markulis. (He intends to destroy it. He does not realize that through this, he serves it!) "Like tying a rock in a slingshot (something that will not last), so is Nosen li'Chesil Kavod (giving honor, i.e. Torah, to a fool)."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A SIMAN THAT MATANOS NEED NOT BE GIVEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Yisrael is a partner with a Kohen or Nochri in an animal, he must make a Siman (so people will know why he does not give Matanos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is a Siman really needed when a Nochri is a partner?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> One who joins with a Kohen must make a Siman;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One who joins with a Nochri or slaughters Pesulei ha'Mukdashim (a blemished Korban) need not make a Siman.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">133b----------------------------------------133b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa discusses when the Nochri sits in the store. (People realize that he owns a share.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, it similarly discuss a Kohen who sits in the store. Why is a Siman needed?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People may think that the Kohen is there to buy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Likewise, people may think that the Nochri is there to buy!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Beraisa discusses when the Nochri sits by the money box.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, it similarly discuss a Kohen who sits there. Why is a Siman needed?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People may think that the Kohen merely guards the money.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Likewise, people may think that the Nochri merely guards the money!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is unlikely that a Yisrael would trust a Nochri with his money.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> A Nochri screams about the price. People realize that he owns a share. (A Kohen is quiet.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one slaughters Pesulei ha'Mukdashim, he need not make a Siman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Pesulei ha'Mukdashim are sold and slaughtered in the market. The meat may be weighed. (This is just like Chulin. People will not know it is exempt from Matanos!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The Beraisa discusses a Korban that one sells from his house (a blemished Bechor or Ma'aser).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE EXEMPTION OF PARTIAL OWNERSHIP</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If a Kohen owns part of the head, Zero'a or intestines, this exempts from the corresponding Matanah (jaw, Zero'a or stomach);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chiya bar Rav):</span> Even if he is a partner in one of these, this exempts from all the Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Chiya bar Rav - Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen sold (most of) his animal to a Yisrael, and said "the head remains mine. The rest is yours," even if the Kohen retained one part in 100 of the head, it is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he said "the Zero'a (or intestines) remains mine. The rest is yours," then even if he retained one part in 100, it is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> In each case, he is only exempt from the Matanah from which the Kohen kept a part.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he is exempt from all the Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> If so, the Beraisa should say that he is exempt from all the Matanos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen sold his animal to a Yisrael, and said "the head remains mine. The rest is yours" then even if the Kohen retained one part in 100 of the head, the Yisrael is exempt from giving the jaw. He must guve the other Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chiya bar Rav is refuted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The following Beraisa misled Chiya;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Twenty-four Matanos were given to Aharon and his sons. We learn them from a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If one observes them, it is considered that he observed every Klal Perat u'Chlal in the Torah, and the covenant of salt regarding Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Ten Matanos are (given and eaten) in the Mikdash - Chatas Behemah and Chatas ha'Of, Asham Vadai (brought for a definite transgression) and Asham Taluy (brought if one is unsure if transgressed a Lav of Kares), Shalmei Tzibur (two lambs brought on Shavuos), the (leftovers) of the Log of oil that a Metzora brings, Shtei ha'Lechem (the two loaves brought on Shavuos), Lechem ha'Panim, the leftover part of Menachos, and the Omer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Four Matanos are (given/eaten) in Yerushalayim - Bechor of Tahor animals, Bikurim, certain parts of Kodshim Kalim (Chazeh v'Shok of a Todah (or Shelamim), Zero'a of Eil Nazir, and one of each kind of bread accompanying Todah or Eil Nazir), and the skin of Kodshim. (Tosfos asked why skin of Kodshim is considered a Matanah in Yerushalayim. It is given in the Azarah, but one may take it anywhere! Rashi - we call a Matanah 'of the Mikdash' only if it becomes Pasul if taken outside.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Ten Matanos are given in all parts of Eretz Yisrael - Terumah, Terumas Ma'aser, Chalah, Reishis ha'Gez, Matanos (foreleg, jaw and stomach), Pidyon ha'Ben, redemption of firstborn donkeys, Sedeh Achuzah (Ploni inherited a field that his ancestors received in the days of Yehoshua, he was Makdish it, Shimon redeemed it, and Ploni did not buy it back before Yovel), Sedeh Cherem (one declared his ancestral inheritance 'Cherem'), Gezel ha'Ger (one stole from a convert, swore to deny it, and repented after the convert died without heirs).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Chiya bar Rav assumed that since Matanos are counted like one, they are like one. (If one is exempt from one, he is exempt from all);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is wrong. Portions of Todah and Eil Nazir are independent, but they were counted like one because they are similar. The same applies to Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Kohen sold the head of his animal to a Yisrael, and kept the rest for himself, must the jaw be given to a Kohen?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it depends on the part that must be given, it belongs to a Yisrael, so it should be given;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it depends on the main part of the animal, it belongs to a Kohen, so Matanos need not be given.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri or Kohen asked a Yisrael to shear his sheep, he is exempt from Reishis ha'Gez;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Yisrael bought the wool on the sheep of a Nochri or Kohen (and sheared it himself), he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In this respect, Matanos are more stringent than Reishis ha'Gez.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Regarding Matanos, it depends on the part that must be given.</p></div>
