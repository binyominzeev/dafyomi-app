<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "He became an officer to the angel and prevailed. He cried and begged to him" - who was over whom?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "You have become an officer with (over) angels" - Yakov became the officer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "He cried and begged to him" - who cried to whom?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "(The angel) said 'send me'" - the angel cried to Yakov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> "You have become an officer with angels and men" - the angel hinted to Yakov that two leaders will descend from him, the Reish Golah in Bavel, and the Nasi in Eretz Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This was a hint of exile.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE MEANING OF THE WINE STEWARD'S DREAM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> "There were three shoots on the vine (in the dream)" - these represent three wealthy influential Yisraelim in every generation;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One or two are in Eretz Yisrael, and the others are in Bavel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The shoots represent three angels appointed over the Nochrim who advocate for Yisrael in every generation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> "Vine" represents this world. "Three shoots" are Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov. "It was like budding, its blossoms arose" refer to the Matriarchs. "Its clusters ripened with grapes" are the Shevatim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Hash-m does not show (in a dream) what has already happened, rather what will happen!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, "vine" represents Torah. "Three shoots" are Moshe, Aharon, and Miryam. "It was like budding, its blossoms arose" is the Sanhedrin. "Its clusters ripened with grapes" are Tzadikim in every generation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> It is better to explain like R. Elazar ha'Modai, for then everything is in one place;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Elazar ha'Modai says, "vine" is Yerushalayim. "Three shoots" are the Mikdash, king, and Kohen Gadol. "It was like budding; its blossoms arose" are young Kohanim. "Its clusters ripened with grapes" are the Nesachim (wine offerings).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Levi explains all of them to allude to Matanos to Yisrael from Hash-m;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Vine" is Torah. "Three shoots" are the well, the cloud and the manna. "It was like budding... " are Bikurim. "Its clusters... " are Nesachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> "Vine" is Yisrael. "Three shoots" are the three festivals. "It was like budding" - the time has come for Yisrael to be fruitful and multiply. "Its blossoms arose" - the time came for Yisrael to be redeemed. "Its clusters... " - the time came for Mitzrayim to drink the poisonous cup.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> 'Cup' is mentioned three times in the dream. These refer to three calamities that will strike Mitzrayim - in the days of Moshe, in the days of Paro-Neko, and what it will suffer with all Nochrim in the future.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Yisrael is compared to a vine;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The branches are working men. The clusters are Chachamim. The leaves are ignoramuses. The small branches are empty people (who lack Torah and Mitzvos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> The cluster must pray for the leaves. Without the leaves, there would not be clusters.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Va'Ekreha Li b'Chamishah Asar Kasef" - 'va'Ekreha' means, I acquired.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>'Chamishah Asar' refers to the 15th of Nisan, on which Yisrael were redeemed from Mitzrayim. 'Kesef' refers to Tzadikim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>"Chomer Se'orim (30 Sa'im of barley) v'Lesech (15 Sa'im of) Se'orim" refer to the 45 Tzadikim on whom the world stands.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are there 30 in Bavel and 15 in Eretz Yisrael, or vice-versa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Ekchah Sheloshim ha'Kesef va'Ashlich Oso Beis Hash-m" - the 30 are in Eretz Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "If it is good in your eyes, give my wages (return my Tzadikim). If not, my wages will be taken, Sheloshim Kesef" are 30 righteous Nochrim on whom the rest of the world stands.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> These are the 30 Mitzvos that the Nochrim accepted on themselves. They keep only three. (Maharav Ransborg gives references discussing the 30 Mitzvos):</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH GIDIM ARE FORBIDDEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Gidim of birds are permitted (because birds have no Kaf, i.e. an end to the thigh bone).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They have a Kaf!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, their Kaf is not round.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If a bird has a round Kaf, what is the law? If an animal's Kaf is not round, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Does it depend on each particular case, or on the species in general?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>These questions are unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>CHELEV OF THE GID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Gid of a fetus is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> All agree that its Chelev is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which Chelev does Shmuel refer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be of the fetus. Tana'im argue about this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The Gid of a fetus is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah permits it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> They argue about a live, fully developed fetus. The opinions of R. Meir and R. Yehudah correspond to their opinions about a Ben Peku'ah. (R. Meir requires it itself to be slaughtered. It is like an independent animal; R. Yehudah says, it is permitted with its mother's Shechitah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He refers to Chelev of the Gid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They argue about this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One must dig out the Gid ha'Nasheh and also remove its fats;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it suffices to skim off the fat on top.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel meant that they agree that mid'Oraisa it is permitted. R. Meir forbids it mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The fat of the Gid is permitted.  Yisrael are stringent not to eat it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Beraisa is R. Yehudah, but R. Meir forbids mid'Oraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> One must dig out all branches of the Gid ha'Nasheh. Its fat is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This Beraisa is like R. Meir, who requires digging it out, and it permits the fat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Shmuel bar Marsa):</span> The Torah forbids only the small branches of the Gid (they are soft, but the essence of the Gid is like a bone.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Even though the Gid has no taste, like wood, one who eats it is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Presumably, Ula is correct, for Rav Asi taught that strands of Chelev are forbidden, but one is not Chayav Kares for eating them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because the Torah forbids Chelev, and not strings;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Similarly, the Torah forbids the Gid, and not the branches!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>STRANDS OF CHELEV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Strands of Chelev are forbidden, but one is not Chayav Kares for eating them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Strands of Chelev in the kidney are forbidden, but one is not Chayav Kares for eating them;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rebbi and R. Chiya argue about whether Chelev in the groove in the kidney is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rabah and R. Yochanan would dig out all of it. Rav Asi would remove only what covers the kidney.</p></div>
