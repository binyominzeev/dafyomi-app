<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN IS A BUTCHER BELIEVED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A butcher (Reuven) said to Shimon 'had you been friendly with me, I would have given you from a fattened ox I slaughtered yesterday.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> I ate from the best part of it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> Where did you get a part?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> I got from a Nochri who bought it from you.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> I slaughtered two fattened oxen yesterday. He bought the Terefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rebbi):</span> Just because Reuven acted improperly (he sold a Terefah to a Nochri meat vendor), we will not forbid people to buy today from Nochrim (since most of the butchers are Yisraelim)! (Rashi; Tosfos - just because Reuven acted improperly (he sold a Terefah without announcing), we will not forbid people to buy from other Nochrim!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This is consistent with another teaching of Rebbi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> When the butchers in the meat markets are Yisraelim, meat found in a Nochri's hand is assumed to be Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rebbi):</span> Just because (Reuven) wants to annoy Shimon (by pretending to have sold a Terefah without announcing), we will not forbid people to buy today from Nochrim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If not that Reuven were trying to annoy Shimon, we would forbid people to buy today from Nochrim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> When the butchers in the meat markets are Yisraelim, meat found in a Nochri's hand is assumed to be Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This case (if Reuven really sold a Terefah) is different, for we know that there is Terefah meat in the market.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MEAT THAT WAS NOT WATCHED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Meat that was (at least for a moment) unsupervised is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> When the butchers in the meat markets are Yisraelim, meat found in a Nochri's hand is assumed to be Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Meat found in a Nochri's hand is different. (We are not concerned lest ravens switched it with meat from a place where most butchers are not Yisraelim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If nine stores in the city sell slaughtered meat and one sells Nevelah, and one is not sure from which he bought, the meat is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If meat is found, we follow the majority.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The meat was found in a Nochri's hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If meat was found in a city:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the majority of butchers are Yisraelim, we assume that it is Kosher. If not, it is Nevelah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If cooked meat is found, we follow the majority of meat eaters.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps here also, the meat was found in a Nochri's hand!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, if it were cooked, we would not follow the majority! (Surely, he cooked it, so it is forbidden.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it was found in a Yisrael's possession, it is permitted. If it was found in a Nochri's hand, it is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Levi saw a person drop the meat. (He could not tell whether the person was a Yisrael.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If meat was found outside Yerushalayim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Whole limbs are assumed to be Nevelah (they are cast whole into the wasteheap). Pieces are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps here also, the finder saw a person drop the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, we would not assume that a whole limb is Nevelah. (It was not meant for the wasteheap!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav explains that the Seifa does not permit pieces to be eaten;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Seifa says only that pieces are not considered Nevelah. (They are not Metamei. One who eats them is not lashed, but one may not eat them, since they were not under constant watch);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Levi):</span> One may eat pieces.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Rav's law was not said explicitly, it was derived from something he said.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav saw a man washing a head in the river. It fell in. The man took a basket and scooped out two heads.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">95b----------------------------------------95b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We do not know from whom the other head fell, so both are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> Perhaps also the other head was permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> It is more likely that it was forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make whether or not Rav explicitly said his law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps Rav said this only in a city where most butchers are Nochrim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> Rav said that forbidden meat is more common.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav, how is one allowed to eat meat?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It was watched from Shechitah until it was eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is wrapped and sealed, or there is a special Siman on it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rabah bar Rav Huna would cut his meat on three corners.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>NICHUSH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav went to visit his son-in-law. The ferry was coming towards him. He considered this to be an omen that he would have a good day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>At the house, he looked through a crack in the door and saw hanging meat. Rav knocked, and everyone came. Only Rav kept watching the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav:</span> (If not for me) would you feed my grandchildren Isur (forbidden food)?! Rav did not eat from the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav kept watching it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Answer #1:</span> He did not eat it, for this would be like Nichush (to fulfill the omen that he would have a good day).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav taught that Nichush is forbidden only if it is like that of Eliezer ("if she will give water to me...") and Yonason (ben Sha'ul, "if they will say 'come up', we will go")! (I.e. one says what he will do if the Siman he requests is fulfilled, and if it is not.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Radak (Shmuel 1:</span>14) - Answer #1: He did not eat it due to Nichush (everyone had neglected the meat. This was a bad omen.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav taught that only a Nichush like that of Eliezer and Yonason is reliable! (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Rav would eat only at a meal that is a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rav would decide (whether to go) based on the ferry (if it came to greet him. Maharsha - this is not Nichush, for he did not say that he acts based on this.) Shmuel would decide based on verses. (I.e. he would open a Sefer Torah to see the verse that comes up - see Shiyurei Berachah on Birkei Yosef YD 179:6.) R. Yochanan would ask a child which verse he is learning. (Rashi; Rambam - a good Siman would make them happy, but they would not act upon it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>When Rav was alive, R. Yochanan would address letters to him 'to our teacher in Bavel.' After Rav died, he would write (to Shmuel) 'to our colleague in Bavel'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel wanted to show that also he was a Rebbi to R. Yochanan in some respect. He sent to him the calculation of (the equinoxes, which determines) which years should be leap years for the next 60 years.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> That is mere calculations!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Shmuel sent him 13 camels laden with (Tosfos - 13 scrolls of) Safek Terefos (Rashi - alternatively, the Safek (Tamei or Tahor) birds of Perek ha'Terefos (62b).)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> He is a Rebbi to me. I will visit him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yochanan asked a child 'what verse are you learning?' The child replied "and Shmuel died." R. Yochanan did not go. (Kesef Mishnah - this is unlike Nichush that the Rambam forbids, for he asked about something in the past, i.e. whether or not Shmuel already died. Beis Yosef - it is forbidden only if one explicitly says that he acts according to the omen.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Really, Shmuel had not died. Hash-m did not want R. Yochanan to exert himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Even though we don't act based on omens, we may act based on Simanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> We may only act on it if it worked three times - "Yosef is missing, and Shimon is missing. If you will take Binyamin (every affliction will come upon me)."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SIMANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (Rav Huna):</span> If meat on a string was not watched, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Obviously it is a Siman (that it is the same meat. It is permitted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Huna):</span> Meat on a string is a Siman (it is permitted, even if it was not watched.) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>On Erev Yom Kipur, ravens dropped livers and kidneys.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> They are permitted. Most meat slaughtered today is Kosher. (This is one of the days on which Yisre'elim slaughter many animals.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Chiya bar Avin lost the end of the intestines. He did not have a Siman, but he recognized it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> They are permitted to you.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Chanina Chuza'ah lost a back of meat. He did not have a Siman, but he recognized it. Rav Nachman permitted the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Noson bar Abaye lost a ball of Techeles thread. He did not have a Siman, but he recognized it. Rav Chisda permitted him to use it (for Tzitzis).</p></div>
