<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE ARGUMENT ABOUT THE KOY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Regarding Kisuy and Matanos, the Tana'im discuss a Koy born from a male deer and a female goat;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All are unsure whether we are concerned for the seed of the father;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say that a partial Seh is a Seh. R. Eliezer disagrees.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Regarding Oso v'Es Beno, they discuss any child of a deer and goat;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the mother is a deer, Chachamim forbid (slaughtering the child and the child's child on the same day. Perhaps we are concerned for the seed of the father, and it is a half-goat.) R. Eliezer permits. (Even if it is a half-goat, it is not forbidden);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the mother is a goat, Chachamim give lashes (for slaughtering the child and its child on the same day, since it is at least a half-goat), and R. Eliezer does not. (He admits that it is forbidden, for perhaps it is a full goat.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>QUESTIONABLE CHAYOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A Koy is a species unto itself. Chachamim were unable to decide if it is a Chayah or Behemah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> A Koy is a wild ram (Tosfos - this is a Chayah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Each holds like a different Tana;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Koy is a wild ram;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Some say, it is the child of a male goat and a female deer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yosi says, it is a species unto itself. Chachamim could not decide if it is a Chayah or Behemah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, it is a Behemah. A certain family grew great flocks of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Forest goats are Kosher for Korbanos. (They are considered goats.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds like R. Yitzchak.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> The Torah lists only 10 Kosher animals. Since forest goats are not listed among the Kosher Chayos, they must be (Behemos, i.e.) goats.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> "Wild goat and deer" (in the verses that list the Kosher animals) are Peratim (specific terms). "Every animal" is a Klal (general term);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>From a Prat and Klal, we include more things!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah meant to include more species, it would not have listed so many Peratim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2: (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> Perhaps the forest goat is Ako (one of the Kosher Chayos that we do not recognize)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3: (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Perhaps it is Te'o or Zemer (other Kosher Chayos)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanan):</span> Ameimar permitted Chelev of the forest goat. (He is sure that it is a Chayah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Aba brei d'Rav Minyamin bar Chiya):</span> Are forest goats Kosher for Korbanos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna bar Chiya):</span> Chachamim and R. Yosi argue only about a wild ox (this is the Arame'ic translation of Te'o). All agree that forest goats are goats;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A wild ox is a Behemah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, it is a Chayah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim learn from its Targum 'Torbela (ox of the forest)';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yosi says, since it is listed among the Chayos, it is a Chayah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1: (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> Perhaps the forest goat is Ako!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2: (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Perhaps it is Te'o or Zemer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanan):</span> Ameimar permitted Chelev of the forest goat. (He holds that it is a Chayah.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SHECHITAH THAT DOES NOT PERMIT THE MEAT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughters...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> The Mishnah is not like R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says that if (a mother and son of) Kodshim are slaughtered outside, the first Shochet is Chayav Kares, both Shochtim are lashed, and both animals are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon holds that improper Shechitah (i.e. it does not permit the meat) is not considered Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since the first Shechitah is not Shechitah, the second animal was a Kosher Korban when it was slaughtered outside. Also the second Shochet should get Kares!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">80b----------------------------------------80b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Mishnah says that if Chulin are slaughtered inside, the second Shochet is lashed, and both animals are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>According to R. Shimon, the first Shechitah is not Shechitah. The second Shochet should not be lashed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The Mishnah says that if Kodshim are slaughtered inside, the first Korban is Kosher, the second is Pasul, and the second Shochet is lashed;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>According to R. Shimon, Shechitah of Kodshim is an improper Shechitah (since it does not permit the meat. Zerikah (throwing the blood) permits it). Also the second Korban should be Kosher, and the Shochet should not be lashed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>All these show that the Mishnah is not like R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Shechitah of Kodshim is considered proper Shechitah, for it helps to permit the meat;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one did Nechirah (cut or tore the Simanim lengthwise), Zerikah would not permit the meat. If one slaughtered, Zerikah permits the meat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Oshaya teaches that is not considered proper Shechitah (since it does not permit the meat immediately, or because Shechitah alone does not permit).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>LASHES FOR TRANSGRESSING OSO V'ES BENO</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the Mishnah mention lashes for slaughtering a Korban too early (when the latter Shechitah is a Korban, for one may not slaughter it until the next day)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "An ox or Seh that has an oversized limb... " teaches that one who offers any Pasul Korban transgresses "it will not be accepted."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah mentions lashes only for Oso v'Es Beno, but not for other Isurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Mishnah mentions lashes for Shechutei Chutz!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If both were Kodshim and slaughtered outside, the first Shochet is Chayav Kares, and both are lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The second is lashed for Oso v'Es Beno, but the first is lashed for Shechutei Chutz!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah mentions lashes for other Isurim only if there are no lashes for Oso v'Es Beno.</p></div>
