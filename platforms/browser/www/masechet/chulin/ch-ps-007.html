<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE PROOF THAT BEIS SHE'AN IS NOT IN ERETZ YISRAEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Yehudah, son of R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> Can you say that Beis She'an is not part of Eretz Yisrael?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Menasheh did not dispossess (the Kena'anim living in) Beis She'an"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon ben Elyakim taught that Olei (the exiles who returned to Eretz Yisrael from) Bavel (in the days of Ezra) refrained from being Mekadesh (giving Kedushas Eretz Yisrael to) many cities that were conquered by Olei Mitzrayim (those who entered with Yehoshua);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Kidush was temporary. (It ended with the first Churban.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They left many cities without Kedushah, to help support the poor in Shemitah. (Since they did not get Kedushah, one may work the land in Shemitah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> R. Meir only ate a leaf. Even if Beis She'an was part of Eretz Yisrael, one need not tithe before a casual eating!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> He ate from a bundle of vegetables;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Vegetables that are normally bundled, once they are bundled one cannot eat them before taking Ma'aseros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Perhaps R. Meir forgot to tithe it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Zeira):</span> Hash-m does not allow a pitfall to come even through animals of Tzadikim, and all the more so through Tzadikim themselves!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Perhaps he designated that the tithes take effect on produce he had elsewhere!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> A Chaver is not suspected of that. He always separates the tithes near the food being tithed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Perhaps he mentally declared the tithes to take effect on part of the vegetable, and ate the other part!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> A great man testified about this. Surely he gave all the pertinent details, lest we learn the wrong law from it! (It seems that this is a second answer to all of R. Yirmeyah's questions.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>R. PINCHAS BEN YA'IR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir was going to redeem captives. He came upon a river and asked it to split.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">The river:</span> We both go (or flow) to do the will of our Maker. It is doubtful if you will succeed. I will certainly succeed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir:</span> If you do not split, I will decree that water will never flow in you!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The river split for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir:</span> There is a man with me carrying wheat for Matzos. Also this is a Mitzvah. Split also for him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The river split also for the man.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir:</span> There is a man who was travelling with us. It is improper that we should abandon him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>The river split also for the man accompanying them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir is greater than Moshe and Yisrael (when they left Mitzrayim). The water split only once for them, but it split three times for R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps here also, it split only once! (He merely requested that they should also be able to pass through safely.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir is as great as Moshe and Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>They arrived at an inn. The innkeeper put barley before R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir's donkey. It would not eat.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He sifted the barley, but still it would not eat. He picked out stray matter mixed in. It did not eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir:</span> Perhaps you didn't tithe it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They tithed it, and the donkey ate.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir:</span> This poor animal goes to do the will of Hash-m, and you give to it Tevel?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really obligatory to tithe food for animals?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one buys Demai for planting, for animals, flour for tanning, oil for lighting or anointing Kelim, there is no need to tithe it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan taught that this applies only if it was initially bought for these purposes, but if it was initially bought for human consumption, and later he reconsidered, they must be tithed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one buys food to eat, and later decides to feed it to an animal, he must tithe it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rebbi heard that R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir was coming. He went out to greet him, and offered to give him to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir:</span> I consent! Don't think that I vowed not to eat from Yisrael. Yisrael are Kedoshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>I usually do not eat from others, for some who offer want to give, but do not have the means;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Others have the means, but do not really want to give - "do not eat from a stingy person... he tells you to eat, but he is insincere."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>You, Rebbi, are sincere, and have the means! I am rushed now, but I will eat with you on my way back.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>When he returned, he entered Rebbi's premises and saw white mules.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir:</span> I cannot eat with one who keeps the angel of death (damagers) in his home!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi heard this. He rushed to apologize - 'I will sell them!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir:</span> "Do not put a stumbling block before the blind"! (Whoever buys from you will transgress.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> I will declare them ownerless!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir:</span> You may not, for then they will damage even more!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> I will cut off their hooves, so they cannot damage.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir:</span> You may not cause pain to animals!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> I will kill them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir:</span> You may not, due to 'Bal Tashchis' (wasting money)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p>Rebbi kept trying to get him to agree to eat. A mountain grew between them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> If Hash-m does this Tzadik's will (not to eat from others) like this in his lifetime, how much the more so, after his death!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE MERIT OF TZADIKIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chama bar Chanina):</span> Hash-m does the will of Tzadikim after their death more than in their lifetime.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"They were burying a man... they cast him into Elisha's grave. The man revived and got up in his feet."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps he did not revive in Elisha's merit, but rather to fulfill the Berachah (that he requested) of Eliyahu - "twice the spirit of Hash-m that was on you, should be on me."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> If so, the man would have lived longer. A Beraisa teaches that he did not even reach his house.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, when did Elisha revive another person, to fulfill the Berachah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He cured Na'aman's Tzara'as. A Metzora is considered like dead - "do not let our sister be like a Mes."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> White mules are called Yemim, because fear of them (Eimasam) is on people.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> No one ever asked me about a wound from a white mule, and Chai (he survived).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We see that people survive such wounds!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (R. Chanina):</span> No one ever asked me about a wound from a white mule, and Chaysah (the wound healed).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We see that such wounds heal!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They do not heal when the end of the mule's feet are white. R. Chanina discusses such mules.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> "There is nothing other than Hash-m", even witchcraft.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A woman was trying to weigh the earth under R. Chanina's feet (in order to harm him through witchcraft). He let her, because the verse says that witchcraft will not work.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught, witchcraft is called Keshafim, for it weakens the Heavenly assembly (MaCHchiSHim FaMalya)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chanina is different. Because his merit is so great, witchcraft cannot affect him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> One does not stub his finger, unless this was decreed above - "the steps of man are prepared by Hash-m"; "a man does not understand his way".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The blood that comes from a man stubbing his finger atones like the blood of a burnt-offering.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is when he stubs his right thumb, before it healed from the last time he stubbed it, when he was on his way to do a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir never blessed on bread that was not his. From the day he matured, he never benefited from a meal from his father.</p></div>
