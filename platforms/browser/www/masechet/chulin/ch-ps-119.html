<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The bones are Yados. Rav holds like Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The bones are Shomrim. Rav holds like Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yochanan explains that the bones are Yados. he holds like Chachamim. (Rashi - he must explain this way; Tosfos - he could also say that the bones are Shomrim, like Chachamim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If a femur (thigh bone) holds a k'Zayis of meat, the entire bone brings Tum'ah and is Metamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Others say, if there is even k'Ful of meat, the bone conducts Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will Rav establish the Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the bone is a Yad (the meat is on it), why do Others say that k'Ful of meat is enough?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the bone is a Shomer (the meat is inside), why does R. Yehudah require a k'Zayis?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The bone is a Yad. Rav holds like R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The bone is a Shomer. Rav holds like Others.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Yochanan holds like Others. The bone is a Shomer. (The law is true also if it is a Yad. We will explain why we prefer to establish the case to be a Shomer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Others require k'Ful of meat. R. Yochanan holds that Shomrim apply even to less than this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, Others don't require k'Ful. Since R. Yehudah specified a quantity, they also did.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rava):</span> Presumably, the Beraisa discusses a Shomer, since it mentions the femur, which always has marrow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Others require k'Ful. This is the minimal quantity for Shomrim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is not a minimal quantity.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Others say 'if there is even k'Ful...'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since R. Yehudah specified a quantity, they also did.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHOMRIM OF SMALL FOODS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against R. Chanina - Mishnah - R. Eliezer ben Azaryah):</span> A bean pod is Tahor (does not conduct Tum'ah. A Shomer is not needed, since beans can be cleaned if they get dirty);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A pea pod is Tamei (conducts Tum'ah like a Shomer), because people want Mishmushan (to touch the peas through the pods, for peas cannot be cleaned if they get dirty).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(Peas are smaller than beans. The Reisha of this Mishnah says that even if one pea remains, the pod is Tamei!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We answer like Rav Acha brei d'Rava said (elsewhere). The stalk is Tamei like a Yad. (It holds many pods, at least a k'Zayis of food in all. The Mishnah never called it a Shomer. That was merely our understanding.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah is Metamei because people want Tashmishan (to use the stalks, i.e. to move the peas).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Al Kol Zera Zeru'a Asher Yizare'a" discusses the way people plant, in which the wheat, barley or lentils are still in their shells. (Even though a lentil is smaller than a bean, the shell is a Shomer!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The law of Shomer applies to a Briyah (something complete like it was created) of any size.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">119b----------------------------------------119b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Oshaya):</span> Can two Shomrim join to the food inside to comprise the Shi'ur of k'Beitzah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If one Shomer guards the other, the outer Shomer does not have the law of a Shomer!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> The innermost of the three outermost shells of onions joins (to k'Beitzah) whether or not it has a hole;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>The middle shell joins only if it does not have a hole;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>The outer shell does not join even if it has no hole.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Shomer was cut into two pieces.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since each piece does not protect the food on the other side, they are not considered Shomrim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, since each piece protects the food on its side, they are considered Shomrim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah - R. Eliezer ben Azaryah):</span> A bean pod is Tahor. Pea pods are Tamei, because people want Mishmushan. (Therefore, the pods are Shomrim. Even though each pod is less than k'Beitzah, they join to comprise the Shi'ur, even though each pod does not protect peas in another pod!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> (The Mishnah does not say that pods join, rather, it teaches that) the stalk is Tamei like a Yad.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is Tamei because people want Tashmishan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Al Kol Zera Zeru'a Asher Yizare'a" discusses the way people plant, the wheat, barley or lentils are still in their shells. (Even though a shell does not protect seeds in another shell, they join to be a k'Beitzah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Just like Rav Acha brei d'Rava answered (above), that the stalk is Tamei like a Yad, we can say that the stalk is a Shomer on all the ears.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, the lower blades of grain protect the higher ones. (If a shell would fall off, the one above it would fall off);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>However, the higher blades do not guard the lower ones! (Even so, they are considered Shomrim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they are all at the same height on the stalk. (If any one was removed, the others could fall out.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Could the grain at one height have the volume of an egg?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes, for example the wheat in the days of Shimon ben Shetach. (It was as big as kidneys of an ox.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Here also, the wheat is like wheat in the days of Shimon ben Shetach (each kernel is the volume of an egg, they need not join).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>IS HAIR A YAD OR A SHOMER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - (Beraisa):</span> (There were two bones from a Mes. Each held half a k'Zayis of flesh.) If part of each bone without the flesh was brought into a house, the house is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Yehudah ben Nekusa says, they cannot join to be a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> A bone is a Yad, but a hair is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even hair is a Yad.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> If skin (of a Nevelah) holds a k'Zayis of meat, one who touches a strand of meat or a hair opposite the meat becomes Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The hair is Metamei because it is a Yad.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is a Shomer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1A - Question:</span> Can there be a Shomer (hair) for a Shomer (the skin)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Hair is rooted in the skin. If the hair was removed, there would be a hole, and the meat would rot. (Therefore, hair itself is a Shomer for the meat.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> If so (there are holes in hide when the hairs are removed), how can we write Tefilin? We (expound "u'Chsavtam" to) require Kesivah Tamah (a pure writing, without holes in the parchment)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We answer like Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael taught, that we are not concerned for any hole that the ink passes over. (I.e. no hole will be seen in the letter.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The hair is a Yad;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Ila'a taught that when there are many strands at the top of a sheaf, each is a Yad, because one can take the sheaf by grasping many strands together. Similarly, when there are many hairs, each is a Yad, because one can take the skin with the meat by grasping many hairs together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where was R. Ila'a's law taught?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> Strands at the top of sheaves bring Tum'ah and are Metamei, but they do not join for Shi'ur Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What can the strands be used for? (Why are they Yados?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ila'a):</span> The case is, there are many strands at the top of a sheaf. (One can take the sheaf through holding all the strands.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1B - Support:</span> Presumably, the hair is a Shomer. One hair cannot serve like a Yad!</p></div>
