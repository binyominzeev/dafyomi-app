<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WE FOLLOW A MAJORITY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to follow the majority?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious! It is "after the majority, to tilt (the verdict)"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches to follow a majority d'Isa Kaman (in front of us, i.e. it can be counted). E.g. nine of the 10 stores in the city sell Kosher meat, and we found meat, and do not know which store it came from. Alternatively, we follow the majority opinion of judges on a Sanhedrin;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The question was, what is the source to follow a majority d'Leisa Kaman (a statistical majority), e.g. that a boy or girl is not a Seris or Ailonis (one who will not develop like a normal male/female)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> We learn from the head of an Olah - "you will dissect the Olah into its (designated) sections", but you do not cut its sections into smaller pieces.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since we may not cut open the head, we cannot check if the membrane around the brain is pierced, which would make it a Treifah. (We must rely on the majority of animals, which are not Treifah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps one tears the skull, but leaves it connected, in order to check!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is forbidden only to cut a section into separate pieces.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar brei d'Ravina):</span> We learn from the Isur to break a bone of the Korban Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since we may not cut the head (at all), we cannot check if the membrane around the brain is pierced, which would make it a Treifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, we rely on the majority of animals, which are not Treifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps we put a hot coal on the skull to burn through, in order to check!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The prohibition of breaking bones does not apply to sinews, nor to burning a bone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> We learn from the Alyah (tail, of a sheep of a Chatas or Shelamim, which is offered intact on the Mizbe'ach).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We cannot check if the spinal cord was cut (which would make it a Treifah). We must rely on the majority!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we cut the Alyah towards the bottom. If the spinal cord was cut there, the animal is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "by the Atzeh (spine)", i.e. near the kidneys, the place of Etzah (counsel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps one tears the Alyah, but leaves it connected, in order to check!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is forbidden only to cut it into pieces.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>(PARTIALLY) SUCCESSFUL ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Sheshes brei d'Rav Idi):</span> We learn from Eglah Arufah (a calf beheaded for atonement when a murdered corpse is found).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"You will break its neck", but it should remain whole, so we cannot check if it was Treifah. We must rely on the majority!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it makes no difference if it is Treifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> It says "atonement" regarding the calf, similar to Korbanos. (Therefore, a Treifah calf is invalid.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rabah bar Rav Shilo):</span> We learn from the Parah Adumah - "He will slaughter... he will burn" - just like it is slaughtered whole, it is burned whole;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since it is burned whole, we cannot check if it was Treifah. We must rely on the majority!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it makes no difference if it is Treifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Torah calls it 'Chatas'. (Therefore, a Treifah is invalid.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> We learn from the goat sent to Azazel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "The two goats" teaches that they must be the same. We/ should be concerned lest one is Treifah!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we rely on the majority of goats that are healthy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it a problem if one (the one sent to Azazel) is Treifah? (Why should we say that they must be the same regarding this?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The lottery is valid only if both are Kosher to be offered to Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we check both!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> Before the goat is halfway down the mountain, it is torn into many pieces. (We cannot tell if there were internal defects when it was alive.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #7 (Rav Mori):</span> We learn from the death penalty for one who strikes a parent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest it is not his father!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even if a married woman has extramarital relations, most of the time she has relations with her husband. Therefore, we assume that she became pregnant through her husband.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we cannot rely on the majority, and the Torah says to kill the son only when we are sure, e.g. the parents were locked together in a jail cell, and no one else could have had relations with the mother!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No one can guarantee that she did not have relations with anyone else. (Perhaps the jail warden opened the cell...)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #8 (Rav Kahana):</span> We learn from the death penalty for a murderer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest the victim was a Treifah, and the murderer is exempt!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We rely on the majority of people, who are healthy (not Treifah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is wrong, and really, we must check that the victim was not Treifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That would be a disgrace to the corpse!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we do so, since this may save the life of the murderer!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even so, we cannot check if there already was a hole where the murderer stabbed him. We must rely on the majority.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #9 (Ravina):</span> We learn from Edim Zomemim (witnesses who testified about something they were not present to see). The Torah says "you will do to him Ka'asher Zamam (like he plotted) to do to his brother." If they tried to obligate Ploni death, we kill them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest Ploni is Treifah! (Killing a healthy witness for plotting to kill a Tereifah is not "Ka'asher Zamam.")</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We rely on the majority of people, they are healthy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we check that the one they testified about was not Treifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - b'Rebbi):</span> If Ploni was not killed, the plotting witnesses are killed (even though we cannot check for internal Treifos). If Ploni was killed, the plotting witnesses are not killed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #10 (Rav Ashi):</span> We can learn from Shechitah itself!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah permits eating what was slaughtered. We should be concerned lest there was a hole where the knife cut!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we rely on the majority of animals, which are healthy.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A PARTIAL REJECTION OF THE ANSWERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Kahana or Rav Simi):</span> All these proofs discuss cases in which there is no alternative. Then, we follow the majority. Perhaps when there is an alternative, we do not follow the majority!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> If you would not distinguish, according to R. Meir, who is concerned for the minority, it should be forbidden to eat meat (lest the animal had a hole where it was slaughtered)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Meir indeed forbids eating meat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Torah commands us to eat Korban Pesach and Shelamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> R. Meir follows the majority when there is no alternative.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Likewise, perhaps Chachamim follow the majority only when there is no alternative! (We have no source to follow the majority when there is an alternative. Rashi - a tradition from Sinai says that we follow the majority.)</p></div>
