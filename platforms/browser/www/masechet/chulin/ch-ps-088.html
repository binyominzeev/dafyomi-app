<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>FLUIDS THAT ARE TAMEI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All fluids of a Mes (corpse) are Tahor, except for its blood. If it appears red, it is Metamei b'Ohel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> Fluids of a Tvul Yom (one who immersed today; he is partially Tamei until evening) are like liquids that he touches. They are not Metamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The fluids of all other Temei'im (Tamei beings), whether they have a light or severe Tum'ah, are like fluids that they touch, i.e. a Rishon l'Tumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The only exception is fluids that are Avos (sources of) Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'Light' Teme'im refers to Sheratzim and Zavim, and 'severe' Teme'im are Mesim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, light Teme'im are Sheratzim, and severe Teme'im are Zavim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Chachamim decree Tum'ah on fluids of a Zav, but not of a Mes?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim wanted to distance people from Tum'ah, so they decreed about a Zav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>People stay far from a Mes even without a decree.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHICH BLOOD MUST BE COVERED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Blood that spurted, and is on the knife...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "V'Chisahu" teaches that blood that spurted or is on the knife must be covered;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, when is this? It is if there is no other blood. If there is other blood, he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> "And you will cover it" teaches that all the blood must be covered, including blood that spurted and blood left on the place of Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, this is only if Dam ha'Nefesh (the blood that leaves when an animal dies) was not covered. If it was covered, he need not cover the other blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana holds that "Damo" connotes all the blood; R. Yehudah holds that even some of it is called "Damo"; R. Shimon ben Gamliel holds that "Damo" refers to its special blood, Dam ha'Nefesh. <span class="note">(<span>Note:</span> 'The first Tana' refers to the first Tana of both Beraisos. Alternatively, R. Yehudah explains the first Tana of Beraisa #1, and 'the first Tana' refers to the first Tana of Beraisa #2 - Tosfos.)</span></p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WITH WHAT MAY WE COVER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may cover the blood with fine manure, fine sand, plaster, or ground up pottery, bricks or cork;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One may not cover with coarse manure or sand, nor with bricks or cork that were not ground up;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One may not cover with a Kli;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, we may cover only with things in which vegetation grows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Version #1 - Question:</span> What is considered fine sand?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This is sand that a potter does not need to crush.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> What is considered coarse sand?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This is sand that a potter must crush.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the two versions?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about sand that needs (to be crushed,) and does not need (a Kli). It can be crushed by hand. (Rashi - this is fine according to Version #1, and coarse according to Version #2. Rosh - the Rif learns oppositely.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one fulfills "v'Chisahu" using rocks, or putting a Kli over it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "be'Afar" (earth).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include fine manure or sand, pulverized rocks or pottery, stubble of flax, sawdust, plaster, crushed bricks or cork?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">88b----------------------------------------88b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "v'Chisahu" (before "be'Afar". This implies that one may cover with anything.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one may cover with coarse manure or sand, ground up metal, bricks or cork that were not ground up, flour, or bran!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "be'Afar".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are the former materials allowed, and not the latter?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Only types of earth are allowed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should say that "v'Chisahu" is a Klal (general term), and "be'Afar" is a Prat (specific term). From a Klal u'Frat we include only the Prat, i.e. earth!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Mari):</span> The Prat was needed to understand the Klal. (We would not have known that the blood must be absorbed in the covering (Rashi; Tosfos - that the blood must be covered also from below);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>In all such cases, we do not expound Klal u'Frat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> We may cover only with something in which we can plant seeds, and they will grow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> That is a boorish thing to say!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> What is wrong with it? I taught this to him. I derived it from a Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man in the desert or on a ship has no earth, he may grind up a gold coin or burn a garment to cover the blood with the fragments or ashes. (This shows that desert sand is invalid because seeds will not grow in it. Ran - in the She'altos' text, Rava brings this to show that Chachamim disagree with R. Shimon ben Gamliel. They allow gold, even though nothing grows in it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Ashes (of a garment) are allowed, because (in a verse) ashes are called earth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why may pulverized gold be used?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> This is also called earth - "earth of gold".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>EARTH AND ASHES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> We may cover only with earth;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Beis Hillel says, also ashes are valid, since they are called earth - "me'Afar Sereifas (ha'Chatas)".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> Ashes are called Afar Sereifah, but not (plain) earth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Also the following materials were allowed - crushed coals, eye powder, and stubble that is extracted from a grinder;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Some allow even orpiment (a yellow dye).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> In the merit that Avraham said "I am earth and ashes", his descendants merited two Mitzvos, ashes of the Parah Adumah, and earth in the water that a Sotah drinks.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rava omit earth of Kisuy ha'Dam?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Mitzvah does not give special benefit (more than standard Mitzvos. Rava's Mitzvos are Metaher and permit a woman to her husband.)</p></div>
