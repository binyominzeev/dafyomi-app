<p class="dedicationbox">CHULIN 31-43 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE SIZE OF A KNIFE FOR SHECHITAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rava checked an arrow for R. Yonah bar Tachlifa. R. Yonah shot it at a bird, and thereby slaughtered it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it cut through Chaladah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He could see that the feathers were cut. This shows that it was not Chaladah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One who slaughters a bird must cover the blood!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he covered it afterwards.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One must put earth underneath before slaughtering!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> It does not say 'he will cover it Afar (earth)', rather, "b'Afar (in earth)" to teach that one must put earth below and above the blood!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yonah designated all the earth of the valley to be the lower cover for the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he slaughtered and chopped off the head...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The knife must extend the length of the neck and further.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must it extend a second neck's length past the neck, or is any amount past the neck enough?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If he slaughtered and chopped off two heads, if the knife extends one neck's length, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'one neck's length' mean in the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It means exactly one neck's length.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">`	Rejection:</span> It cannot be that one neck's length suffices for two animals, but we need more than one neck's length for one animal!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it means one neck's length beyond the two necks of the animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Also R. Zeira meant that it must extend a neck's length beyond the neck.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This applies when he cut in only one direction...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Menasheh):</span> The Mishnah discusses a razor without protrusions at the ends.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Avya):</span> May a needle be used to slaughter?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Menasheh):</span> No, for it tears.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha):</span> May a cutter's needle be used?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Menasheh):</span> The Mishnah says 'of any size' to include this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This comes to include a cutter's needle.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it includes a razor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah explicitly permits a razor!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah clarifies what it said. We permit a knife of any size, i.e. a razor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> Presumably, this is correct. If the Mishnah permitted a cutter's needle, it would not need to permit a razor!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it must teach a razor. One might have thought that we decree to disqualify a razor, due to razors with protrusions. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHECHITAH WITHOUT INTENTION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a knife fell and slaughtered, even if it slaughtered properly, it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"You will slaughter and you will eat" - what you slaughter you may eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> This is only when it falls by itself. Had one made it fall, it would be a valid Shechitah, even though he had no intention!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is our Tana, who does not require intent to slaughter?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is R. Noson.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ushaya Ze'ira - Beraisa - R. Noson):</span> If one threw a knife to stick it in a wall, and it slaughtered on the way, the Shechitah is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ushaya Ze'ira):</span> The Halachah follows R. Noson.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava established another Stam Mishnah like R. Noson. Why did he need to do so twice?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Cheresh (deaf-mute), lunatic or minor slaughtered with others looking on, it is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is this Tana, who does not require intent to slaughter?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is R. Noson.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We could not learn from one to the other;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>From the Beraisa, we know only that R. Noson is Machshir when the person intended to make an incision of some kind. We would not know that he is Machshir when he threw the knife down without intent to cut;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>From our Mishnah, we know only that R. Noson permits what a person with Da'as (understanding) slaughtered. We would not know that he permits what a Cheresh, lunatic or minor slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>INTENT NEEDED FOR TAHARAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> If a Nidah was immersed unwillingly, she is permitted to her husband, but forbidden to eat Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> She is forbidden even to her husband.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Rav permits her to her husband, even though relations with a Nidah is Chayavei Kerisus. All the more so he should permit her to eat Terumah, for which there is only Misah b'Yedei Shamayim (for eating it b'Tum'ah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Her husband is Chulin. Immersion for Chulin does not require intent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If a wave containing 40 Sa'im of water separated from the sea and fell on a person and on Kelim, they are Tehorim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like the Kelim had no intent to become Tehorim, also the person!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The case is, he was waiting for such a wave to fall on him;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Kelim are like the man. Just like he must intend to become Tahor, he must also intend for them to become Tehorim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he was waiting for such a wave to fall on him, surely he becomes Tahor. Why must the Mishnah teach this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we decree lest he immerse in a channel of rainwater (without 40 Sa'im in one place/ The channel is not considered to be connected.) Alternatively, perhaps we should decree to disqualify Tevilah in the end of the wave that touches the ground, lest one come to immerse Kelim in the middle of the wave in mid-air. The Mishnah teaches that there is no such decree.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that we may not immerse in a wave in mid-air?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> We may immerse in waves that reached that ground, but not in waves in mid-air, for we do not immerse in air.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> If Peros fell into an irrigation channel, and Reuven's hands were Tamei and he stuck his hands in and removed the Peros, his hands become Tehorim and the Peros are not Huchshar. (Peros can receive Tum'ah only if they became wet, and liquid willingly came on them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he wanted to wash his hands, his hands become Tehorim and the Peros are Huchshar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If a man immersed with intention to eat Chulin in Taharah, he becomes Tahor for Chulin, but he may not eat Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that intention is required even for Chulin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> (Intent is not needed for Chulin.) The Beraisa teaches that even though he (had intent and) became Tahor for Chulin, he may not eat Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If a man immersed without intention, it is as if he did not immerse.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is as if he did not immerse at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> No. It is as if he did not immerse for Ma'aser, but he became Tahor for Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rava doubted the validity of these answers until he found a Beraisa supporting Rav Nachman.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man immersed without intent, he is Tahor for Chulin, but he may not eat Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> This Beraisa refutes R. Yochanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> R. Yochanan holds like another Tana, i.e. R. Yonason ben Yosef:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yonason ben Yosef) Question:</span> Why does it say "the garment will be washed (immersed) a second time"? We already knew that this is the second time!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This equates the second washing to the first. Just like the first washing requires intent ("v'Tzivah ha'Kohen v'Chivso"), also the second.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like the first washing requires the Kohen's intent, also the second!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "It will become Tahor", even without the Kohen's intent. (Another's intent suffices.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> R. Yochanan said that the Halachah always follows a Stam Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a knife fell and slaughtered, even properly, the Shechitah is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It is invalid because it fell. Had he cast it down it would be Kosher, even though he had no intent!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of our Mishnah, who says that no intent is needed for Shechitah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is R. Noson.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even R. Yonason ben Yosef agrees that Shechitah (of Chulin) needs no intent. We infer this from the Halachah that Shechitah of Kodshim needs intent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim (who argue with R. Noson) infer that (for Chulin) intent to slaughter is not required, but intent to cut is required.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Noson's reasoning is better than Chachamim's;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "you will slaughter", but not 'you will cut'. If we need intent, we should need intent to slaughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of a Nidah immersing against her will?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rachel forcibly put Leah in a Mikveh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, Rachel's intention would suffice. Leah may even eat Terumah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A healthy woman can permit a deaf, insane, or blind woman to eat Terumah. (She checks her for Dam Nidah, and immerses her at the proper time.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Rather, according to R. Noson, she fell from a bridge. According to Chachamim, she entered the water to cool off and fell in all the way.</p></div>
