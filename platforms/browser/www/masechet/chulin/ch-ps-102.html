<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> They both learn from "do not eat the blood, for the blood is the soul. Do not eat the soul with the flesh (i.e. do not eat the flesh while it still has its soul)";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah and R. Elazar hold that the verse discusses everything whose blood is forbidden. This includes Teme'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim expound, "do not eat the soul with the flesh", rather, eat the flesh alone (after its soul departed). The verse discusses animals whose flesh is permitted, i.e. Tehorim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Yehudah need a verse to teach that the Isur applies to Teme'im? Ever Min ha'Chai is forbidden even to Bnei No'ach. Such an Isur is Chal Al Isur (like he holds about Gid ha'Nasheh)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he does not need a verse. R. Yochanan explains R. Elazar's source that the Isur applies to Teme'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> "Do not eat the blood, for the blood is the soul. Do not eat the soul with the flesh" applies to Behemos, Chayos and birds, both Tehorim and Teme'im, i.e. everything whose blood is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim expound "do not eat the soul with the flesh", rather, eat the flesh alone. The verse discusses things whose flesh is permitted, i.e. Tehorim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir says, it applies only to Behemos Tehoros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Shmuel):</span> R. Meir learns from a previous verse "from your cattle and flock" that this applies only to Behemos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> The Tana'im argue only about Yisrael, but all agree that Bnei No'ach are commanded also about Teme'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support #1 (Beraisa):</span> Bnei No'ach are commanded about Ever Min ha'Chai of Teme'im just like of Tehorim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Bnei Yisrael are commanded only about Tehorim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> The correct text of the Beraisa says Teme'ah and Tehorah. The singular form indicates that these apply only to a Behemah. This is like R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> The correct text of the Beraisa says Teme'im and Tehorim. The plural form indicates that this applies to Behemos, Chayos and birds. This is like Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Support #2 (Rav Shizbi - Mishnah):</span> The following apply to a Tamei bird:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who eats Ever Min ha'Chai is not lashed. Shechitah does not permit it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To whom does this apply?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot apply to a Yisrael. Obviously, slaughtering it does not permit it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It applies to a Ben No'ach (Shechitah does not permit it while it is still quivering. It is forbidden like (limbs of) a living animal until it dies. Kesef Mishneh - 'the Mishnah says 'he is not lashed', i.e. Beis Din does not punish (kill) him. The Mishnah used the expression we normally use to teach this regarding Yisrael. A Nochri is never lashed!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mani bar Patish):</span> The Reisha says that Ever Min ha'Chai does not apply to a Tamei bird (it exempts from lashes). The Seifa says that it does apply!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mani bar Patish):</span> The Reisha applies to Yisraelim. The Seifa applies to Bnei No'ach.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE QUANTITY FOR WHICH ONE IS LIABLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> To be liable for eating Ever Min ha'Chai, one must eat a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because the Torah forbids 'eating' it. This always connotes a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Amram - Mishnah):</span> One who eats Ever Min ha'Chai (of a Tamei bird) is not lashed. Slaughtering it does not permit it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to Rav, it is a Chidush (that he is not lashed for a Tamei bird) only if he eats a k'Zayis. If he ate a k'Zayis, he is lashed for eating a Tamei bird!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We answer like Rav Nachman said (elsewhere). He ate a limb that is a k'Zayis. The amount of flesh was less than a k'Zayis. (The rest was bones and sinews, which are not forbidden in Tamei species.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">102b----------------------------------------102b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Rav taught that if one eats a (whole) live Tahor bird he is liable, no matter how small it is;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was dead (Nevelah), he is liable only for a k'Zayis;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding a Tamei bird, whether alive or dead, he is liable no matter how small it is.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also (in Rav's first law), the entire bird was a k'Zayis. The flesh was less than a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If one eats a (whole) live bird less than a k'Zayis, he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Elazar bar Shimon obligates.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Elazar b'Ribi Shimon:</span> One is liable for eating one limb. All the more so, he is liable for the whole bird!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>If he choked it and ate it, all agree that he is liable only for a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav):</span> They argue only about whether a living being l'Evarim Omedes (since it will ultimately be dissected into limbs, Ever Min ha'Chai already applies):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Elazar holds that l'Evarim Omedes. Rebbi does not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When Ever Min ha'Chai applies, both obligate for less than a k'Zayis!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The whole bird was a k'Zayis. The flesh was less than a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would we ever find a bird without a k'Zayis of flesh, but one limb alone has a k'Zayis of flesh, bones and sinews?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sharbiya):</span> Yes! He discusses a Kalanisa (a very lean bird).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> If he choked it and ate it, all agree that he is liable only for a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Kalanisa is Tamei. Rav obligates for a Tamei bird of any size, dead or alive!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he discusses a Tahor bird that resembles a Kalanisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Rebbi holds that intention to eat makes a difference, if one intended to dissect and eat the limbs of a bird less than a k'Zayis, but then ate it whole, he would be liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Do we ever find that Reuven is liable for eating something (i.e. if he had such intent, but ate it whole), but Shimon (who had no such intent) would be exempt for it?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Yes! The law of each person depends on his intention.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If R. Elazar b'Ribi Shimon holds that intention to eat makes a difference, if one intended to eat a bird (less than a k'Zayis) after it dies, and ate it alive, he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Do we ever find that Reuven is exempt for eating something (i.e. if he had such intent, but ate it alive), but Shimon (who had no such intent) would be liable for it?!</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FLESH OF A LIVING ANIMAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Do not eat the soul with the flesh" forbids Ever Min ha'Chai. "Do not eat torn meat in the field" forbids Basar Min ha'Chai (flesh of a living animal) and Basar Terefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Do not eat the soul with the flesh" forbids Ever Min ha'Chai and Basar Min ha'Chai. "Do not eat torn meat in the field" forbids Basar Terefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one ate Ever Min ha'Chai and Basar Min ha'Chai, R. Yochanan is Mechayav twice, and Reish Lakish is Mechayav once;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he ate Basar Min ha'Chai and Basar Terefah, R. Yochanan is Mechayav once, and Reish Lakish is Mechayav twice;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one ate Ever Min ha'Chai of a Terefah, R. Yochanan is Mechayav twice, and Reish Lakish is Mechayav once;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All agree that these are learned from different verses. Why is Reish Lakish Mechayav only once?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Both are Mechayav twice if he eats Ever Min ha'Chai and Basar of a different Terefah animal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about Ever Min ha'Chai of a Terefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The case is, it became Terefah during birth (or before);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan holds that l'Evarim Omedes, so both Isurim take effect simultaneously (at birth);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish holds that Lav l'Evarim Omedes, so only the Isur Terefah takes effect at birth;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>When a limb separates later, the Isur of Ever Min ha'Chai does not take effect, since the animal is already forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Neither holds that l'Evarim Omedes. They argue about whether Ever Min ha'Chai is Chal on Terefah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan says that it is. Reish Lakish says that it is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Both hold that l'Evarim Omedes. The case is, it became Terefah after birth;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about whether or not the Terefah is Chal on Ever Min ha'Chai.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yochanan says that it is. Reish Lakish says that it is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> The case is, a limb was torn off the animal, making it Terefah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan holds Lav l'Evarim Omedes (so Ever Min ha'Chai and Terefah are Chal simultaneously);</p></div>
