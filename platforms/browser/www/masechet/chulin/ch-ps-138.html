<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE AMOUNT OF SHEARINGS THAT IS LIABLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Abaye:</span> We can defend one of the opinions you cited.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1A:</span> R. Yochanan himself holds (like he said above) that the Kohen gets five (even if the Yisrael only keeps one). He said in R. Yanai's name that the Kohen gets only one part in 60 (even though this is less than five, even according to the Shi'ur of R. Dosa).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav contradicts himself. Above, he said a Maneh and a half! (A 60th of this is less than a Sela.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav discusses a Maneh of 40 Sela'im, so a Maneh and a half is 60 Sela'im. The Kohen gets a Sela.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (our text) Abaye:</span> We can solve one of the difficulties in your teaching.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We can resolve the contradiction in R. Yochanan. He himself holds (like he told Isi) that 60 are liable. He said in R. Yanai's name that six are liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Versions #1B and 2) Question:</span> Rav contradicts himself. Here he says that 60 are liable. Above, he said a Maneh and a half!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav discusses a Maneh of 40 Sela'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(All versions) Question:</span> Would the Tana really call 40 Sela'im a Maneh?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An unfinished pouch is not Mekabel Tum'ah, even if pomegranates would not fall out;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If it was finished and then tore, it receives Tum'ah if pomegranates would not fall out;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, it receives Tum'ah if it can hold balls of woof threads, each a fourth of a Maneh of 40 Sela'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (One must give shearings that will weigh five Sela'im after they are cleaned.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Yisrael need not clean them, just he must give enough so that after the Kohen cleans them, he will have five Sela'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In order that the Kohen can make a small garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> "La'amod Leshares" - it must suffice to make a garment a Kohen serves in, the Avnet (belt).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it must suffice to make the (Kohen Gadol's) Me'il (coat)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You may assume only the smallest amount, but nothing more than this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it must suffice to make a wool cap!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Kohen Gadol wore a wool cap. The Tzitz rested on it, to fulfill "v'Samta Oso Al Pesil Techeles."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Hu u'Vanav" - it must suffice for a regular Kohen as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Wool is not needed for the Avnet of a regular Kohen!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is not difficult according to the opinion that a regular Kohen's Avnet is unlike the Kohen Gadol's Avnet on Yom Kipur (which is pure linen). Rather, a regular Kohen's Avnet includes wool;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, according to the opinion that it is the same, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The wool suffices for the Avnet of the Kohen Gadol. Also regular Kohanim wear Avnetim, albeit theirs are not of wool.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DOES THE MITZVAH APPLY IF HE SOLD THE SHEEP?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he dyed the wool before giving it, he is exempt...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If he sold each sheep after shearing it (before shearing the next), he must give Reishis ha'Gez;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Noson bar Hoshaya):</span> He is exempt, for when he has five shearings, he does not own the sheep (it is not "Tzoncha").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one buys wool from (Rambam; Rashi - attached to) a Nochri's sheep, he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he bought the sheep themselves (to shear them), he would be liable (even though after shearing each, it reverts to the Nochri; when he shears the last sheep, he no longer owns the previous ones)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda, on behalf of R. Noson):</span> The case is, the Nochri sold the sheep to the Yisrael for a period of time (longer than needed to shear them all).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon buys wool attached to Reuven's sheep (if Reuven retained for himself, he is liable. If not, Shimon is liable.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is our Tana, who holds that if the seller retains for himself, he is liable?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Yehudah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Levi buys trees in Yosef's (grain) field, he must leave Pe'ah on each tree.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, this is only if he bought all the trees;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If Yosef retained trees, he leaves Pe'ah (Rashi - from his grain) on behalf of all the trees.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> You yourself explained that R. Yehudah's law is only if Yosef started harvesting before he sold (for then he was already obligated to leave Pe'ah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps here also, Reuven sold the sheep after he started shearing them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Regarding Pe'ah, it says "uv'Kutzrechem Es Ketzir Artzechem" - once he starts, he must leave Pe'ah on the whole field;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>There is no obligation for Reishis ha'Gez until he shears all five sheep!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Our Tana is the Tana of the following Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven bought the innards of a cow from a butcher, he gives the stomach to a Kohen, without deducting from the price;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Reuven bought by weight, he gives the stomach to a Kohen, and does not pay for its weight.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">138b----------------------------------------138b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We conclude that one does not sell (Rashi; Tosfos - buy) Matanos that must be given to a Kohen. The same applies to Reishis ha'Gez!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Therefore, if the seller retained sheep, he must give the full amount;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>If he sold all the sheep, the buyer has the Kohen's portion.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK SHILU'ACH HA'KAN</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN THE MITZVAH APPLIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shilu'ach ha'Kan (sending the mother bird) applies in Eretz Yisrael and in Chutz la'Aretz, whether or not the Mikdash stands. It applies to Chulin, but not to Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Kisuy ha'Dam applies to Chayos and birds, whether or not they are Mezuman (owned by the Shochet). This is a stringency over Shilu'ach ha'Kan, which does not apply to Mezuman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered not Mezuman?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Geese or chickens that nested in an orchard are not Mezuman;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One is exempt if they nested in his house, and from sending domestic doves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>One is exempt from sending a Tamei bird, even if it is on Tahor eggs, or a Tahor bird sitting on Tamei eggs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Eliezer obligates sending a male Korei sitting on eggs;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Chachamim exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Avin or R. Meisha):</span> In all these Perakim (from the 10th onwards) it says that the Mitzvah applies in Eretz Yisrael and in Chutz la'Aretz. There was no need to teach this, except for Reishis ha'Gez (and Perek Ha'Zero'a, regarding Matanos);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There, it was necessary to say this, to exclude the opinion of R. Ila'i, who exempts in Chutz la'Aretz. (It was taught in the other Perakim for parallel structure.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of R. Avin and R. Meisha):</span> In all these Perakim it says whether or not the Mikdash stands. This was needed only for Oso v'Es Beno;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since it is written in the Parshah of Kodshim, one might have thought that it applies only when we can bring Kodshim. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avin and R. Maisha):</span> In all these Perakim, the words "in Chulin and in Kodshim" are neeeded, except for Gid ha'Nasheh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Obviously, Gid ha'Nasheh applies also to Kodshim. Should the Isur vanish because he was Makdish the animal?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We established the Mishnah to teach about offspring of Kodshim! (It is a Chidush that the Isur of the Gid takes effect, since the fetus is forbidden before the Gid is formed.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We established it like this only to explain the Mishnah's Chidush that it applies to Kodshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We can say that it was taught merely for parallel structure! (We can say that the Mishnah discusses Chulin that was made Hekdesh, and it is no Chidush.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It applies to Chulin, but not to Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are Kodshim exempt?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Shale'ach Teshalach" discusses a bird that you are commanded to send away, but not Kodshim (which you should bring to the Gizbar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Likewise, the Mitzvah does not apply to a bird that killed a person. Such a bird should not be sent. It should be taken to Beis Din to be stoned!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Beis Din sentenced it to die, they would have killed it. How was it found?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Beis Din did not sentence it. The finder must bring it to Beis Din to fulfill "u'Vi'arta ha'Ra mi'Kirbecha."</p></div>
