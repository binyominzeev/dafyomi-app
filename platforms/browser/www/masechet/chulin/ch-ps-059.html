<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one eats three measures of Chiltis before his meal, his skin will come off.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Avahu:</span> I ate one measure. Had I not been in water, my skin would have come off - "Chachmah gives life to Chachamim".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Ingesting the wrong combination of eggs, nuts, pits and honey in summer (before the meal) can uproot the heart.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A deer whose hind legs were cut was brought before the Reish Galusa. Rav checked the juncture of the sinews and ruled that it is Kosher. He planned to eat from it lightly roasted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> You should be concerned lest a snake bit it (on a leg that was cut off)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav:</span> How can we check for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Shmuel instructed to put it in the oven (to fully roast it). It started crumbling.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> "No mishap will occur to a Tzadik."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav:</span> "No secret is withheld from you."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SIMANIM OF KOSHER SPECIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Torah gives Simanim that show which animals and Chayos are Tahor, but does not give Simanim for birds;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim gave Simanim for birds. Any bird that is Dores is Tamei. (Here, Dores does not mean to poison through scratching. Rashi - it holds its food in its claws while eating; R. Tam (61A) - it eats its prey before it dies.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a bird has an extra toe, and a crop, and the stomach peels off, it is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok says, any bird that divides its claws (when perching on a stick) is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a Chagav (grasshopper or locust) has four legs and two extra forelegs, and four wings that cover the majority (of the body), it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi says, it must be called Chagav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Fish that have Senapir and Kaskeses are Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it must have two Kaskesin and one Senapir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kaskeses are fixed in the body (scales). Senapir is what it uses to swim (fin.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> The Simanim of Tahor animals are "the hooves are split..." - any animal that chews the cud surely has no upper teeth, and it is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is not always true. A camel chews the cud and has no upper teeth, but it is Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A camel has two upper teeth (or tooth-like protrusions. Tosfos - this answer is incomplete. It does not answer for rabbits. Later, the Gemara asks about rabbits. Rashba - we currently understand the Beraisa to say 'any animal that chews the cud and has no upper teeth is Tahor'. This answer is complete.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> A young camel (chews the cud and) does not have any upper teeth (and it is Tamei)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Rabbits and Shafanim chew the cud, have upper teeth and are Teme'im! (Some identify Shafan with a hare, rock-badger, or a kind of woodchuck.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #3:</span> The Torah does not say that Taharah depends on upper teeth!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to all questions):</span> The Beraisa means that if an animal has no upper teeth, it surely chews the cud and has split hooves, so it is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must we look for teeth to know about the hooves? One can see whether the hooves are split!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This rule is needed when the hooves are cut off. It suffices to check the mouth.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If one finds an animal in the wilderness whose hooves are cut off, he checks the mouth. If there are upper teeth, it is Tamei. If not, it is Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He may rely on this only if he knows that the animal is not a camel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Camels have two upper teeth, the rule works for camels!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he must know that it is not a young camel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Just like young camels are exceptions to the rule, perhaps there are more exceptions!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "The camel, for it chews the cud" - the Torah lists all the Tamei animals that chew the cud. All others that chew the cud are Tehorim. (Chazal knew that any animal without upper teeth chews the cud. Seemingly, we should be concerned for exceptions to this rule, for the Torah did not teach it! Perhaps it is impossible to chew food sufficiently without upper teeth, unless it has been partially digested in a stomach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If one finds an animal on the road whose mouth is cut off, he checks the hooves;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they are split, it is Tahor. If not, it is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He may only rely on this if he knows that the animal is not a pig.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Just like pigs are exceptions, perhaps there are more exceptions!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "The pig, for it has split hooves" teaches that pigs are the only Tamei animals with split hooves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If one finds an animal in the wilderness whose hooves and mouth are cut off, he checks the flesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it tears lengthwise and widthwise, it is Tahor. If not, it is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He may only rely on this if he knows that the animal is not an Arod (wild ass?).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Just like the Arod is an exception, perhaps there are more exceptions!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We have a tradition from Moshe from Sinai that there are no other exceptions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where does he check the flesh?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He checks under the tailbone.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SIMANIM OF NON-DOMESTICATED ANIMALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> These are the Simanim of Chayos...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Interjection):</span> Chayos have the same Simanim (of Taharah) like domestic animals!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> The Beraisa gives the Simanim to distinguish Chayos from Behemos. The difference is that Chelev of Chayos is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">59b----------------------------------------59b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> These are the Simanim of Chayos, whose Chelev is permitted - any animal with horns and hooves;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Dosa says, it suffices if it has horns. Hooves is not a sufficient Siman by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Keresh (giraffe?), even though it only has one horn, (its Chelev) is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The rule is not reliable. Goats have horns and hooves, but their Chelev is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The horns must grow in shells (to be a Siman).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not true. An ox has shelled horns, but its Chelev is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Having grooved horns is a Siman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Goats have grooved horns, but their Chelev is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The horns must branch out. (Tosfos - they must be straight, but bent at the end.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A deer is a Chayah, but its horns are not like this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Having such horns is a sure Siman that it is a Chayah. If not, the horns must be shelled, grooved and pointed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The grooves must be very close to each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The argument about goats of Karkuz depended on this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>The Reish Galusa had a goat of Karkuz. He stored up its Chelev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Achai:</span> The Chelev is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav Shmuel brei d'R. Avahu (permitted it and) ate some of the Chelev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> The Halachah follows Rav Shmuel. Even so, due to respect for Rav Achai, one should not permit the Chelev in front of Rav Achai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even though a Keresh has one horn, its Chelev is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SPECIAL CREATIONS OF HASH-M</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A Keresh is the deer of Bei Ilai. Tigras is the lion of Bei Ilai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> There are nine Amos between the sides of a lion of Bei Ilai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> A deer of Bei Ilai is 16 Amos long.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Kaiser:</span> Your G-d is compared to a lion. Valorous men can kill lions!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Chananyah:</span> He is compared to a lion of Bei Ilai.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Kaiser insisted on seeing this lion, above R. Yehoshua's protests. R. Yehoshua asked Hash-m to bring the lion.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>When the lion was 400 Parsah away, it roared. All the pregnant women miscarried, and the walls fell down. When the lion was 300 Parsah away, it roared; people's teeth fell out, and the Kaiser fell off his chair. He asked R. Yehoshua to ask Hash-m that the lion return to its place.</p></div>
