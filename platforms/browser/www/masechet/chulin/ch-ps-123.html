<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> Four Mil is the Shi'ur in the direction one was going, but one need not backtrack even one Mil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> If he can obtain them by backtracking less than one Mil, he must do so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TUM'AH AND YADOS FOR SKIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a troop of soldiers on the way to war entered a house, the contents are Tamei, because a troop always carries skins of heads (for witchcraft).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is not surprising. Kings put on their heads the skin of R. Yishmael's head.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one flays any animal to make a mat:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he only flayed the amount needed to hold (grip) the skin, this can transmit Tum'ah (like a Yad; one opinion in Tosfos says, like a Shomer).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he flays to make a water pouch, it is Tamei (like a Yad or Shomer) until the chest;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he flays from the legs, the entire skin is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yochanan ben Nuri says, the skin on the neck is not connected regarding Tum'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Chachamim say, all the skin is Tamei until he finishes flaying.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the law after flaying enough to hold the skin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> All the flayed skin is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Asi):</span> The last Tefach flayed (the Tefach adjacent to where the skin is still attached) is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one flays more than enough to hold the skin, one who touches the flayed skin is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This includes the last Tefach flayed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it excludes the last Tefach flayed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The skin opposite (still on) the flesh is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The last Tefach flayed is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. "Skin opposite the flesh" includes the last Tefach flayed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one flays any animal to make a mat, the amount needed to hold the skin, this is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The last Tefach flayed is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, only two Tefachim have been flayed. Rav Asi's law applies only when more has been flayed. (Then, the last Tefach is useful.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One Tefach is needed to hold the skin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> Two Tefachim are needed to hold the skin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution (Abaye):</span> Beraisa #1 discusses a double Tefach (it equals two regular Tefachim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A double Tefach is needed to hold the skin.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BREAKING A KLI TO MAKE IT TAHOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man was ripping a Tamei cloak to be Metaher it, once he rips the majority, it becomes Tahor. (Tosfos - this is retroactive, from when he started tearing.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> This is only if it is a Tevul Yom. (It was immersed today. Even if it were not torn, it would be fully Tahor tonight);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since he was willing to immerse it (even though this is bad for it), we are not concerned lest he not tear the majority.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he did not immerse it, we decree that he must tear it fully to be Metaher it, lest he not tear the majority.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rabah):</span> We must decree that tearing the majority is not Metaher on the day it became Tamei, lest people will think that Kelim become fully Tahor through immersion on the same day!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">123b----------------------------------------123b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rabah):</span> R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Shimon forbids severing the Simanim of Olas ha'Of during Melikah. We cut only the majority;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He does not decree (Tosfos - that he must cut a large majority) lest he not cut the majority!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to Objection #1 - Rav Yosef):</span> People will see that the majority was torn and understand that this was Metaher it, and not the immersion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to Objection #2 - Rav Yosef):</span> Kohanim (who do Melikah) are zealous. We need not decree lest they not cut enough.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he flayed only the amount needed to hold the skin, it is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he flayed more, it is Tahor. We do not decree lest he flay only the amount needed (and mistakenly think that it is Tahor)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Tum'ah mid'Oraisa, we would make such a decree;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah discusses only Tum'ah mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, we can say that the Tum'ah is mid'Rabanan regarding a Tahor animal, e.g. the man is Tamei mid'Rabanan;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, the Mishnah discusses also a Tamei animal. It is (a Nevelah, which is) Tamei mid'Oraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah does not discuss Tamei species, rather, a Terefah of a Kosher species, which is Tamei mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Terefah is not Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It can be, like Shmuel's father taught;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel's father):</span> If a Terefah Kodesh animal was slaughtered, it is Tamei mid'Rabanan.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> (This is because it is hard to flay Sheratzim.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Rather, regarding a camel, the skin on the neck is not connected;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a piece is big enough, it is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Tearing the majority is Metaher only for a cloak;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Skin is strong (it can be sewn together like before), so it remains Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Also regarding skin, tearing the majority is Metaher, for it is not strong.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Less than five Tefachim is Tahor. We do not say that since it is strong, we consider it to be connected!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avin):</span> Each piece flayed is considered disconnected, for it will not be joined to the meat again.</p></div>
