<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DO MOST WHO SLAUGHTER KNOW THE LAWS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If Reuven saw Shimon slaughter from the beginning until the end, he may eat from the Shechitah. If not, he may not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Reuven knows that Shimon knows the laws of Shechitah, why must he see the entire Shechitah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he knows that Shimon does not know the laws, obviously he must see the entire Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Reuven is unsure whether Shimon knows the laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We should say that most people who slaughter know the laws! (It should be permitted, even if Reuven did not see the Shechitah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a slaughtered chicken was found in the market, or if Levi told a Shali'ach to slaughter, and Levi (Rashi, according to Shitah Mekubetzes; Tosfos - the Shali'ach) found the animal slaughtered, we assume that it was slaughtered properly.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>We assume that the Shochet (the one who slaughters) knows the laws, since those who do not know, do not slaughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, Reuven knows that Shimon does not know the laws. The case is, he saw Shimon cut one Siman;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since he cut one properly, we may assume that he cut the second properly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav Nachman teaches that this is not so. He must see both Simanim cut. Perhaps he happened to cut the first Siman properly, but he paused or Daras while cutting the second Siman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Dimi bar Yosef):</span> If Reuven asked a messenger to slaughter for him and later found the animal slaughtered, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> He may assume that it was slaughtered properly.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Dimi bar Yosef):</span> If Reuven asked a messenger to take Ma'aser for him and later found the Ma'aseros separated, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> He may not assume that the Ma'aseros were separated properly.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Dimi bar Yosef):</span> This is inconsistent!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there is a Chazakah that a Shali'ach fulfills his mission, we should assume also that Ma'aseros were separated properly!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If there is no such Chazakah, why may we assume that the animal was slaughtered properly?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Really, there is no such Chazakah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Shechitah, even if someone (Ploni) overheard Reuven command the Shali'ach (and Ploni slaughtered the animal), most people who slaughter know the laws, so we assume that Ploni is from the majority;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding Ma'aser, if Ploni overheard and took Ma'aser for Reuven, it is invalid, for Ma'aser cannot be taken without the owner's request.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about whether most who slaughter know the laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If Reuven lost his goats and chickens, and found them slaughtered, one may not eat them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Chanina, son of R. Yosi ha'Gelili permits them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> R. Yehudah's opinion is Nir'eh (correct) when he found them in a trash heap. R. Chanina's opinion is Nir'eh when he finds them in the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Chanina holds that most who slaughter know the laws, and R. Yehudah disagrees.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> No, all agree that most who slaughter know the laws;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the slaughtered animals are found in the house, all permit them. If they are found in a trash heap in the market, all forbid them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They argue about animals found in a trash heap in the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that one often casts a Neveilah in a trash heap in his house. R. Chanina disagrees.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> R. Yehudah's opinion is Nir'eh when he found them in a trash heap...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which trash heap does he refer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He cannot mean a trash heap in the market. Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak said all agree in that case!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he refers to a trash heap in the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa - Rebbi):</span> R. Chanina's opinion is Nir'eh when he finds them in the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what part of the house did he find them?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He found them in a proper part of the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak said that all agree in such a case!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he found them in a trash heap in the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> In the beginning of the Beraisa, Rebbi agreed with R. Yehudah in this case. In the end of the Beraisa, he sides with R. Chanina!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi meant that R. Yehudah's opinion is Nir'eh (appears correct) to R. Chanina (i.e. R. Chanina agrees with him) regarding a trash heap in the market (they are forbidden);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They only argue about a trash heap in the house, and in this case, R. Chanina's opinion is Nir'eh (to me, Rebbi).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHECHITAH WITHOUT INTENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Except for a Cheresh, lunatic or minor, lest they (will) slaughter improperly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It does not say, lest they slaughtered improperly, rather lest they (will) slaughter improperly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This teaches that l'Chatchilah, one may not let them slaughter Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If any of them slaughtered while others looked on, the Shechitah is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of our Mishnah, who does not require intent for Shechitah of Chulin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is R. Noson;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Noson):</span> If a man threw a knife in order to so that it will stick into a wall, and as it went it slaughtered normally, the Shechitah is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Oshaya Ze'ira of Chavriya):</span> The Halachah follows R. Noson.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shechitah requires drawing the knife back and forth (unless it is a long knife)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the knife bounced off the wall and cut in the reverse direction as well.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CAN A MINOR HAVE INTENT?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Version #1 (R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan) Question: Does intent of a minor take effect?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> He should ask whether a minor's actions take effect!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely, he knew the Mishnah that teaches that a minor's actions take effect. The same Mishnah teaches that his intent does not take effect!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a child hollowed out an acorn, pomegranate or nut to measure earth, or to use in a balance scale, this makes them Kelim to be Mekabel Tum'ah, because a minor's actions take effect, but his intent does not.</p></div>
