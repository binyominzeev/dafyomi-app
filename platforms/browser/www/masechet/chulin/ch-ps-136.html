<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rava):</span> (According to R. Ila'i,) partners (in a field) need not take Ma'aser, because it says "Ma'aser Degancha", and not of partners;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Without this, why would we learn from Reishis ha'Gez to exempt them? We should learn from Terumah that they are liable (the more stringent way to learn)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, they are liable even without "me'Es Zovchei ha'Zevach." Rather, this teaches Rava's law, that the Kohen may claim the Matanos from the Shochet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Partners (in a field) need not bring Bikurim, because it says "me'Artzcha", but not of partners;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches Rav Yehudah's law, that a borrowed garment is exempt (mid'Oraisa. Mid'Rabanan, it is only exempt) for 30 days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Partners (in a house) need not build a Ma'akeh (fence around the roof), because it says "Gagecha", but not of partners;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes the roof of a Beis ha'Keneses or Beis Medrash. (Everyone owns these, even people overseas.)</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Bechor of a jointly owned animal is Kodesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Ila'i says, it is not.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "bi'Vkarcha uv'Tzoncha."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "u'Vechoros Bekarchem v'Tzonchem"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>That teaches that all of Yisrael will bring their (Kodesh) Bechoros to the Mikdash, but each is individually owned.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Nesinah" regarding Matanos, like it says regarding Reishis ha'Gez. Just like partners are exempt from Reishis ha'Gez, also from Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Implied refutation #3):</span> R. Ila'i must exempt partners from Terumah. If not, he should rather learn from Terumah to obligate partners!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SIMILARITY OF REISHIS HA'GEZ TO TERUMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since he learns from Terumah, Matanos should not apply in Chutz la'Aretz, just like Terumah does not apply there!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi of Naharbil):</span> Indeed, he exempts!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Ila'i):</span> Matanos do not apply in Chutz la'Aretz. Also, Reishis ha'Gez does not apply there.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It says "Nesinah" regarding Reishis ha'Gez, like it says regarding Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, Reishis ha'Gez should be Tovel (forbid benefit from shearings before it is separated), just like Terumah is Tovel!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Reishis Gez Tzoncha Titen Lo" - before it is separated, it has no effect (to forbid. It said Reishis earlier in the verse, so this is extra to be expounded.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like a Zar who eats Terumah is liable to death (bi'Yedei Shamayim, if he ate b'Mezid) or pays principal and an added fifth (if he ate b'Shogeg), the same should apply to benefit from Reishis ha'Gez!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "U'Mesu Vo... v'Yosaf Chamishiso Alav" - a fifth is added "Alav (on Terumah)," but not on Reishis ha'Gez;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One dies "Vo (for Terumah)," but not for Reishis ha'Gez.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like one separates two Ma'aseros after taking Terumah, one should have to take two Ma'aseros after Reishis ha'Gez!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Reishis" teaches that only one separation is made.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, R. Ila'i holds that one may not!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If a man sheared two sheep and left the shearings, and sheared them again the next two years, the shearings do not join to obligate giving Reishis ha'Gez.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he sheared different sheep the following years, after shearing five different sheep, the shearings would join to obligate Reishis ha'Gez!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> If a man sheared five different sheep, but not all in the same year, they do not join.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> We must say that Beraisa #1 is Chachamim, and Beraisa #2 is R. Ila'i. (This shows that he holds that new Gez does not exempt old Gez.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Just like we take Terumah only if the produce grew b'Chiyuv (it belonged to one who will be obligated to give it, i.e. a Yisrael), Reishis ha'Gez should apply only if the wool grew b'Chiyuv!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Terumah is only taken from produce if it grew b'Chiyuv?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> (David ha'Melech personally conquered Surya. Our Tana holds that such territory is not considered part of Eretz Yisrael (mid'Oraisa). Terumah applies there mid'Rabanan, but only if it grows on a Yisrael's land). If a Yisrael bought a Nochri's field in Surya, and there was attached produce:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the produce was less than a third grown (when it was bought), Terumah must be taken when it ripens;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Akiva says, if it was a third (or more) grown when it was bought, when it ripens, Terumah must be taken on what grew afterwards;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Chachamim entirely exempt it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps indeed, Reishis ha'Gez applies only if the wool grew when a Yisrael owned it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> If one buys wool from (Rambam; Rashi - attached to) a Nochri's sheep, it is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he bought the sheep in order to shear them, he would be liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Ila'i argues with the Tana of our Mishnah. (He exempts in this case.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">136b----------------------------------------136b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like one may not separate Terumah from one species on (i.e. to exempt) a different species, one may not take Gez on a different Min (kind, e.g. color) of sheep.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one may not separate Terumah from one species on another?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven had white and black figs, or two types of wheat, he may not make one Terumah or Ma'aser on the other;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yitzchak says, Beis Shamai forbid this, Beis Hillel permit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, the same applies to Reishis ha'Gez!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven had dark and white sheep, and he sold to Shimon wool only of the dark ones, Reuven and Shimon both give Reishis ha'Gez.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> Also, if he sold wool only of the males, but not of the females, they both give.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely, this is not because they are different Minim! Rather, we must say that (Reuven must give Reishis ha'Gez for all the wool;) the Mishnah allows Reuven to buy back (the inferior) hard wool of males and give the proper proportion of it, and to give soft wool of females proportional to the amount of soft wool;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Likewise, he may give both colors. (However, one could exempt the other!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed (as we have already seen), the Mishnah is unlike R. Ila'i.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like one cannot make all the produce Terumah, one cannot make all the shearings Reishis ha'Gez!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, that is R. Ila'i's opinion!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said "all my grain is Terumah," or "all my dough is Chalah," nothing takes effect;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He learns a Gezerah Shavah "Nesinah-Nesinah" from Matanos. Just like a Terefah is exempt from Matanos, also from Reishis ha'Gez.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Ma'aser because it is similar to Reishis ha'Gez in seven respects;</p></div>
