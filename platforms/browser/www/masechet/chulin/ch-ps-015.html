<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>BENEFITING FROM LABOR DONE ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (to Question 1:d, 14a - Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Yehudah's opinion about Melachah done on Shabbos (b'Shogeg).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one cooks on Shabbos, if he was Shogeg, he (and others) may eat the food (immediately). If he was Mezid, he (and others) may not eat the food (on Shabbos);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if he was Shogeg, he (and others) may eat the food after Shabbos. If he was Mezid, he may never eat the food (but others may);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar says, if he was Shogeg, he may never eat the food, but others may eat it after Shabbos. If he was Mezid, no one may ever eat the food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah is like R. Meir, and it discusses one who was Mezid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses Shabbos and Yom Kipur, to teach that they are the same. Just like on Yom Kipur he may not eat it, whether or not he was Mezid, also on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot say that he was Shogeg. It says that he is Chayav Misah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that even though he would be Chayav Misah if he was Mezid, since he was Shogeg, the Shechitah is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah is like R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar, who says that whether he was Shogeg or Mezid, the food is forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar distinguishes. After Shabbos, only others may eat the food. The Mishnah says 'the Shechitah is Kosher.' This implies that anyone may eat.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE FINAL RULING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">A reciter of Beraisos:</span> If one cooked on Shabbos, if he was Shogeg, he may eat the food. If he was Mezid, he may not eat it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rav silenced him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rav do this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He did so because Rav holds like R. Yehudah, and the reciter holds like R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> That is no reason to silence him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Rav does not hold like R. Yehudah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan bar Ami):</span> Rav would rule to his Talmidim like R. Meir. In public he ruled like R. Yehudah, due to ignoramuses. (If they heard that the Halachah follows R. Meir, they might invent new leniencies.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the reciter said this in the public class; therefore, Rav had to silence him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There would be no need. People listen to the man broadcasting the Chacham's words, and not to a reciter teaching on his own.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The reciter said if one slaughters on Shabbos, if he was Shogeg, he may eat the meat. If he was Mezid, he may not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav objected, for R. Meir permits only food cooked on Shabbos, since it could have been eaten raw, but not meat slaughtered on Shabbos, for one could not eat it without Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah forbids meat slaughtered on Shabbos, and Rabanan said that Rav establishes the Mishnah like R. Yehudah. This implies that R. Meir would permit it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir permits only when one (in the household) was (dangerously) sick when Shabbos began. (They planned to slaughter for him if necessary.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it was permitted to slaughter. Why does R. Yehudah forbid the meat?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he became healthy again before the Shechitah; like Rav Acha bar Ada taught.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Rav Ada bar Ahavah citing Rav):</span> If one slaughters for a sick person (on Shabbos), a healthy person may not eat from the meat. If one cooks for a sick person, a healthy person may eat the food.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are these different?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One could not eat the meat without Shechitah. Food could have been eaten raw.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Sometimes when one slaughters for a sick person, a healthy person may eat from the meat, for example, one was sick when Shabbos began;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Sometimes when one cooks for a sick person, a healthy person may not eat the food, e.g. he detached (Rashi; Tosfos - cooked) gourds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi of Nehardai):</span> The Halachah is, if one slaughters for a sick person, a healthy person may eat from the meat raw.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the animal must be slaughtered to eat even a k'Zayis (a small amount), there is no concern lest he slaughters also for the sake of healthy people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi of Nehardai):</span> If one cooks for a sick person, a healthy person may not eat the food.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is a decree, lest he come to cook extra for healthy people.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH INSTRUMENTS ARE KOSHER FOR SHECHITAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If one slaughters with a hand scythe, rock or reed, the Shechitah is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Anyone may slaughter, at any time, with anything, except for a sickle, saw, teeth, or fingernail, for these tear the Simanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> 'If one slaughters' connotes b'Di'eved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, one should not slaughter with a hand scythe, lest he come to slaughter with the side that is not smooth;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, a rock or reed is Kosher l'Chatchilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may slaughter with anything, e.g. a rock, glass, or a reed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is b'Di'eved when they are attached (to the ground). When they are detached it is l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If one slaughters with something attached, Rebbi disqualifies the Shechitah, and R. Chiya is Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rav Kahana said only that R. Chiya is Machshir b'Di'eved, but not l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Chiya really say that it is b'Di'eved?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may slaughter with anything, be it detached or attached, whether the knife is above the animal's neck or below it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa is not like Rebbi, nor like R. Chiya!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Chiya permits the Shechitah only b'Di'eved; and Rebbi disqualifies it even b'Di'eved!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> Really, the Beraisa is like R. Chiya. He permits it l'Chatchilah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Kahana taught the argument about b'Di'eved, to teach that Rebbi disqualifies the Shechitah even b'Di'eved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah permits only b'Di'eved. This is unlike Rebbi (he forbids even b'Di'eved), and unlike R. Chiya (he permits l'Chatchilah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Indeed, Answer (g) is correct.) R. Chiya permits l'Chatchilah. Our Mishnah is like Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Kahana taught that Rebbi disqualifies even b'Di'eved!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Kahana discusses when the knife was always attached. The Mishnah is Machshir b'Di'eved when the knife was originally detached and later attached.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one slaughters with a (knife on a) wheel, it is Kosher. Shechitah with an attached knife is Kosher. If he stuck a knife in the wall and slaughtered, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a reed grew on its own, or a rock jutted out from a wall (e.g. in a cave, similar to the reed, which grew by itself) and he slaughtered with it, it is invalid.</p></div>
