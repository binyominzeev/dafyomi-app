<p class="dedicationbox">CHULIN 31-43 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>FORBIDDING ANOTHER'S PROPERTY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Mishnah):</span> If two people slaughtered together, and one intended to serve (a mountain, etc.), and the other intended for proper Shechitah, the Shechitah is invalid. (The Mishnah does not distinguish whose animal it is. This shows that one can forbid another's property!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. The case is, they are partners in the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Metamei Shimon's Terumah or Kodshim, or mixed Shimon's Chulin with Terumah, or was Menasech Shimon's wine (poured it for a libation to idolatry), if he was Mezid, Reuven must pay. If not, he is exempt. (This shows that his Nisuch forbids Shimon's wine!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The case is, Reuven is a partner in the wine. (Directly, he forbids only his own share. However, one may not drink Shimon's share, since it is mixed with Reuven's.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Huna argues with Rav Nachman (and Rav Amram and R. Yitzchak), like the following Tana'im argue.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri was Menasech a Yisrael's wine not in front of an idol, the wine is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah ben Beseira and R. Yehudah ben Bava permit it for two reasons. Nisuch is only in front of an idol, and one cannot forbid what is not his.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Nachman can hold like the first Tana. Only a Nochri forbids another's property;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Yisrael was Menasech, we assume that he did not really intend for idolatry, rather to vex the owner of the wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against the rejection - Mishnah):</span> If two people slaughtered together, and one intended to serve (a mountain, etc.), and the other intended for proper Shechitah, the Shechitah is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the one with forbidden intent is a Mumar. (He is like a Nochri. He really would serve idolatry.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Metamei Shimon's Terumah or Kodshim, or mixed Shimon's Chulin with Terumah, or was Menasech Shimon's wine:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he was Mezid, Reuven must pay. If not, he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Reuven is a Mumar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If Levi was warned just before he was Menasech Shimon's wine, and he replied 'I do so, accepting that I will be executed for this', what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The wine is forbidden. This is the ultimate case of a Mumar!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHECHITAH THAT APPEARS TO BE FOR IDOLATRY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not slaughter above seas, rivers, or Kelim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may slaughter into a pit of water, and on a ship one may slaughter onto a Kli (in a way that the blood will run off into the sea).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We never slaughter above an (empty) pit. One may make a pit in his house in order that the blood will flow into it (this will be explained below);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This may not be done in Reshus ha'Rabim, lest it encourage Tzedukim. (This is how they slaughter to idolatry).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> We do not slaughter above...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Just like we may not slaughter above seas, lest people think that he serves the angel appointed over the sea, we should forbid to slaughter above a pit with water, lest people think that he serves his reflection!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He may slaughter above a pit of water only if it is cloudy (there is no reflection in it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We never slaughter above an (empty) pit...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah continues 'one may make a pit in his house...'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We never slaughter above an empty pit in Reshus ha'Rabim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Since the Seifa says 'this may not be done in Reshus ha'Rabim', this shows that the Reisha does not discuss this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, the Mishnah teaches that we never slaughter above an (empty) pit. If one wants to keep his courtyard clean, he makes a furrow near the pit and slaughters above the furrow, and the blood flows into the pit;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may not do so in Reshus ha'Rabim, lest it encourage the Tzedukim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one is travelling on a ship, and does not have a place on the ship to slaughter, he sticks his hand outside the ship and slaughters. The blood runs down the sides of the ship;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We never slaughter above an (empty) pit. If one wants to keep his courtyard clean, he makes a furrow near the pit, and slaughters above the furrow, and the blood flows into the pit;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One may not do so in Reshus ha'Rabim, due to "do not go in the ways (of idolaters)".</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If one did so, we investigate to see if he is an idolater.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ONE WHO CLAIMS TO SLAUGHTER A KORBAN OUTSIDE THE MIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughters a Chulin animal (outside the Mikdash), and says that it is an Olah, Shelamim, an Asham Taluy (a Korban brought for a Safek Kares), a Korban Pesach, or a Todah, the Shechitah is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon says, it is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If two people hold a knife and slaughter, one intends for one of the above, and the other for a proper Shechitah, the Shechitah is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If one slaughters a Chulin animal, and says that it is a Chatas, an Asham Vadai (for a definite Aveirah), a Bechor (firstborn), Ma'aser, or a Temurah (an animal that one said should be in place of a Korban), the Shechitah is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The rule is, if he says that it is a Korban that one may bring voluntarily, the Shechitah is invalid. If one may not bring the Korban voluntarily, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> If one slaughters and says that it is an Olah...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one bring an Asham Taluy voluntarily?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The Mishnah is R. Eliezer, who permits bringing an Asham Taluy every day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may not bring Korban Pesach voluntarily. One may bring it only on Erev Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Oshaya):</span> One may designate an animal to be a Korban Pesach at any time. (Therefore, people may believe that it really was a Pesach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (R.Yanai):</span> The Shechitah is Pasul only if the animal is unblemished, but no one would believe that a Ba'al Mum is a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> The law applies even to a Ba'al Mum. Sometimes, the blemish can be covered up, and people will not know that it has a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he says that it is a Chatas...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is valid only if he is not obligated to bring a Chatas. If he must bring a Chatas, people will think that he slaughtered his Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He did not say that it is his Chatas!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> The case is, he said 'it is my Chatas.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>(Mishnah):...A Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> It is only valid if he does not have a Korban in his house. If he has, people will think that this was a Temurah of his Korban!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He did not say that it is a Temurah of his Korban!</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>OTHER CASES THAT THE MISHNAH ALLUDES TO</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The rule is (anything that one may bring voluntarily...)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes the Olah of a Nazir;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since people know that he is not a Nazir, there is no concern;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. They might think that he accepted Nezirus in private.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Mishnah says 'any Korban that one may not bring voluntarily' to include a man who brings the Olah of a Yoledes (woman that gave birth).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) (R. Elazar):</span> It is Kosher only if he is single, but if he is married, people will think he brings it for his wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He did not say that he brings it for her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> The case is, he said 'it is Olas Yoledes, for my wife'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, obviously we are concerned lest people think that it is a Korban!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that births become known. (Since we did not hear that his wife gave birth, all will know that the animal is Chulin);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. People will think that she miscarried (something that obligates a Korban).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> One might have thought that we are concerned lest people think it is a Korban. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. Had his wife given birth, people would know about this.</p></div>
