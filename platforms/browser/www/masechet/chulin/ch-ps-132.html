<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>GIVING MATANOS TO A KOHENES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Ula would give Matnos Kehunah to a Kohenes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> The Minchah of a Kohenes is eaten (except for a Kometz (handful), which is burned on the Mizbe'ach). The Minchah of a Kohen is not eaten. (It is Kalil, i.e. entirely burned on the Mizbe'ach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If "Kohen" included Kohenes, "Kol Minchas Kohen Kalil Tiheyeh Lo Se'achel" would apply also to Minchas Kohenes!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> Just the contrary! The Torah had to write "Aharon u'Vanav" to teach that this applies only to male Kohanim. Otherwise, a Kohenes would be included!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Aharon u'Vanav" teaches that Minchas Kohen is Kalil, but Minchas Kohenes is not. We learn to Matanos (about which it says only "Kohanim," that a Kohenes is excluded. Tosfos says that perhaps this is only if she is married to a Zar. This would explain why the Gemara does not say that Tana'im argue about Ula's law.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - d'Vei R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> The Matanos may be given to a Kohen or Kohenes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Kohen" excludes females. It says "Kohen" twice in the Parshah. Two exclusions (for the same matter) come to include.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rav Kahana (a Yisrael married to a Kohenes) received and ate Matanos due to his wife, and so did Rav Papa, Rav Yemar, and Rav Idi bar Avin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> The Halachah follows Rav, Rav Chisda, Ula, and Rav Ada bar Ahavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The firstborn of a Bas Levi is exempt from Pidyon ha'Ben (even if the father is a Yisrael).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MATANOS OF A KOY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Matanos apply to Kil'ayim (a crossbreed) and a Koy;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Eliezer obligates Matanos from Kil'ayim of a male goat and female sheep. He exempts from that of a male goat and female deer (our text; Maharshal - he exempts from a Koy).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Matanos and Kisuy ha'Dam, R. Eliezer and Chachamim argue only about Kil'ayim of a female goat and male deer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Both Tana'im are unsure whether the child is considered the same species as its mother (here, a Seh), or a hybrid of its mother and father (half-deer, half-Seh).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(Matanos apply only to "Shor" and "Seh".) They argue about whether "Seh" includes a half-Seh;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Eliezer exempts. He holds that "Seh" does not include a half-Seh. (Perhaps the child is considered a hybrid).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Chachamim obligate. They hold that "Seh" includes a half-Seh (the child is a half or full Seh. Similarly, Kisuy applies only to birds and Chayos. They argue about whether "Chayah" includes a half-Chayah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Chachamim should obligate only half the Matanos! (Perhaps it is only a half-Seh. The Kohen cannot disprove this)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna bar Chiya):</span> Indeed, Chachamim obligate giving only half the Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira - Mishnah):</span> In some ways, a Koy is like a Behemah. In some ways, it is like a Chayah. In some ways, it is both:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Its Chelev is forbidden, like a Behemah. Its blood must be covered, like a Chayah. Its blood and Gid ha'Nasheh are forbidden, like a Behemah and Chayah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Matanos must be given, like a Behemah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Eliezer exempts.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> This implies that full Matanos must be given. According to Rav Huna, the Chachamim should specify that half Matanos must be given!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since one cannot say that Chelev and blood are half-Asur, they did not say that one must give half the Matanos. (We want the Seifa to parallel the Reisha.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (c) - Ravin):</span> Chachamim obligate full Matanos from a Koy:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Torah could have said only "Shor". "Im Shor" includes Kil'ayim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It could have said only "Seh". "Im Seh" includes a Koy (for full Matanos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Eliezer learn from "Im Seh"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Matanos are given even when one slaughters only a Shor or Seh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim learns this from "me'Es Zovchei ha'Zevach." (It is singular, i.e. one slaughtered animal).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Eliezer learn from "me'Es Zovchei ha'Zevach"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches Rava's law, that the Kohen can claim from the Shochet (even if someone else owns the animal).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>EXEMPTIONS FROM MATANOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Bechor was mixed among 100 animals:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If different people slaughter all of them, all are exempt from Matanos (the Kohen cannot prove that any Shochet must give);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one person slaughters all of them, he must give 99 (sets of) Matanos. (Only one animal is exempt.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One who slaughters for a Kohen or Nochri is exempt from Matanos;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If a Yisrael is a partner with a Kohen or Nochri in an animal, he must make a Siman (sign) on the animal (so people will know why he does not give Matanos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If a Kohen told a Yisrael "I sell my animal to you, except for the Matanos," Matanos need not be given.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If Reuven bought the innards of a cow from a butcher, he gives the stomach to a Kohen, without deducting from the price;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Reuven bought by weight, he gives the stomach to a Kohen, and does not pay for its weight.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (In the Reisha) why are the owners exempt from Matanos? In any case, Matanos belong to Kohanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the animal is a Bechor, the entire animal belongs to a Kohen;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is not a Bechor, Matanos must be given!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">132b----------------------------------------132b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Oshaya):</span> The case is, the Bechor (that was mixed with the others) was given to a Kohen, and he sold it (blemished) to a Yisrael. (Therefore, it is exempt from Matanos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who slaughters for a Kohen or Nochri is exempt from Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the Mishnah say "a Kohen or Nochri is exempt from Matanos"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah teaches that the Kohen claims from the Shochet (for he is commanded to give Matanos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Matanos are given "me'Es ha'Am", but not from (animals of) Kohanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>"Me'Es Zovchei he'Zevach" - they are from any Shochet, even a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>R. Tavla lodged with a Kohen in dire financial straits. He suggested that he make a deal with Shochtim, that they will give to him a share of the animals that they slaughter, for this will exempt them from giving the Matanos. Rav Nachman obligated the owners to give the Matanos. R. Tavla asked why he did this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> R. Acha bar Chanina taught that a Kohen who slaughters is exempt for two or three weeks. After this, he must give the Matanos to another Kohen. (Tosfos - after this, surely he slaughters others' animals. We decree lest Yisrael Shochtim give a small share to a Kohen to be exempt from the Matanos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Tavla:</span> Why did you obligate the owner? Three weeks have not elapsed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Since they slaughter in a store, it is known immediately that they slaughter others' animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A Kohen who does not separate the Matanos is excommunicated (after three weeks, or if he set up a store).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Shila):</span> The Shochtim of Hutzal have been excommunicated due to Rav Chisda's decree for 22 years.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We do not excommunicate longer than this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> The punishment for one who transgressed a Lav is limited, but if one refuses to perform a (Rashi - inexpensive) Aseh, such as dwelling in a Sukah, taking the four species, or putting Tzitzis on his garment, is lashed until he (fulfills it or) dies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After 22 years, we may fine them without warning.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rava would give the entire thigh to a Kohen (from Shochtim who refused to give Matanos. Normally, only the upper two bones of the Zero'a are given);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak would give the Shochet's garment to a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>EATING THE MATANOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> One should give the Zero'a to one Kohen, the stomach to a second Kohen, and split the jaw among two Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yitzchak bar Yosef taught that in Eretz Yisrael, they split every bone among two Kohanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He discusses an ox. Rav Chisda taught about a Seh. (Its limbs are smaller.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> One may not eat from an animal before Matanos are separated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Eating from an animal before Matanos are separated is like eating Tevel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Halachah does not follow ((Tosfos - the second law of) Rabah bar bar Chanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Matanos must be eaten roasted and with mustard (unless the Kohen prefers it a different way);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn from "l'Mashchah" - for grandeur, the way kings eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> There are 24 Matnos Kehunah. We do not give to a Kohen who does not know their laws (e.g. that they must be eaten with grandeur).</p></div>
