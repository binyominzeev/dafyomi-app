<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>FORBIDDEN ABSORPTIONS OF EGGS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> An egg does not forbid a mixture 60 times its own size. It itself is not counted towards 60.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> This implies that eggs give Ta'am. However, people say that egg water (i.e. in which eggs were cooked) is like plain water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The case is, there was a chick inside the egg.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Tamei eggs (i.e. of a Tamei bird) would not forbid a mixture.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Tamei eggs were cooked with and gave Ta'am to Tahor eggs, all are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Tamei' eggs means eggs with a chick inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If eggs were cooked and a chick was found inside one of them, if it gave Ta'am to them, they are all forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This implies that the Reisha does not discuss chicks in eggs!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa explains the Reisha;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Tamei eggs were cooked with and gave taste to Tahor eggs, all are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The case is, a chick was found inside one of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> The Reisha cannot discuss when no chick is inside, for then the Seifa would not need to forbid them when a chick is found in one!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Seifa must say so, lest we think that in the Reisha, a chick is inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since in the Seifa a chick is inside, the Reisha must discuss when no chick in inside, and even so they are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT FRACTION CAN BECOME BATEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A k'Zayis of Chelev fell into a pan of meat. Rav Ashi thought to include what had been absorbed by the pot in the calculation of whether or not there was enough Heter to be Mevatel the Chelev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> The pot absorbed also Chelev! (If you will reckon with absorbed Heter, you should also assume that there was more than the k'Zayis of Chelev we see now.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A half-k'Zayis of Chelev fell into a pan of meat. Mar bar Rav Ashi thought that if there was 30 times as much Heter, it would be Mevatel the Chelev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Do not be lenient about the quantities that Chachamim fixed (i.e. 60 times);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Also, you must be stringent because R. Yochanan forbids mid'Oraisa even less than a Shi'ur (the quantity for which one gets lashes or Kares, i.e. k'Zayis).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shemen bar Aba):</span> A (forbidden) egg among 60 forbids all of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is among 61, they are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> People will understand that you permit if there are 61 eggs including the forbidden egg. Two giants of the generation were unsure about this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Idi and R. Shmuel bar Nachmani, citing R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> A (forbidden) egg among 60 forbids all of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it is among 61, they are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the forbidden egg among the 61, or not?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They were unable to answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> If 60 permitted eggs and one forbidden egg became mixed, they are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If 61 permitted eggs and one forbidden egg became mixed, they are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi's Rebbi):</span> A man came in front of R. Gamliel ben Rebbi. Half a k'Zayis of Isur had become mixed with 45 times as much Heter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> My father permitted one part in 47 (of Isur. This shows that we do not need 60.) I can permit 45. (Yerushalayimi (cited by Tosfos 64b Gi'ulei) - the shells help to comprise 60 times the volume of Isur.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A similar case occurred with R. Shimon ben Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> My father permitted one part in 45. I can permit 43.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> A man came in front of R. Gamliel ben Rebbi. Isur was mixed with 45 times as much Heter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> My father forbade one part in 47. Should I permit 45?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A similar case occurred with R. Shimon, the son of Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> My father did not permit one part in 45. Should I permit 43?! (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>A man came in front of R. Chiya;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> There isn't 30 times as much Heter as Isur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there would have been, would he have permitted it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> No. He said that there isn't even 30 times as much Heter. (Even then, it would be forbidden!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba, citing Bar Kapara):</span> Any Isur in the Torah is Batel among 60 parts of Heter (if the Isur cannot be tasted).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> Rav Asi cited Bar Kapara to say that it is Batel among 100 parts of Heter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Both opinions learn from (Bitul of) the foreleg of Eil Nazir - "v'Lakach ha'Kohen Es ha'Zero'a Beshelah" (the Kohen gets the cooked foreleg);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Beshelah" teaches that it (the foreleg) is cooked whole;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">98b----------------------------------------98b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, this teaches that it is cooked with the ram.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> All agree that it is cooked with the ram. They argue only about whether it is cut off before or after cooking. (Rashi - Chachamim say that it is first cut off. Tosfos - R. Shimon says so.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> All agree that it is cut off before cooking. They argue about whether or not it is cooked with the ram. (Chachamim say that it is not, and R. Shimon says that it is.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>According to Version #1, all agree that it is cooked with the ram. Even though the Zero'a is forbidden to Zarim, the rest of the ram is permitted to anyone. I.e., the Ta'am of the Zero'a is Batel in the ram.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>According to Version #2, we learn this from R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>The opinion that says 60 times learns from Bitul of the taste of the meat and bones of the foreleg amidst the meat and bones of the ram (which are 60 times as much);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The opinion that says 100 times learns from Bitul of the meat of the foreleg among the meat of the ram (which is 100 times as much. We ignore the bones, for they do not give or absorb Ta'am.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DO OTHER ISURIM BECOME BATEL?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we really learn from the Zero'a to other Isurim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This is the case of something forbidden becoming permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'This' excludes other Isurim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa is like R. Yehudah, who says that Min b'Mino (an Isur mixed with Heter that looks and tastes the same) is never Batel. The Zero'a is the only exception.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn from the Zero'a to other cases!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (On Yom Kipur, we mix the bloods of the goat and bull that are offered in the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim.) Dam ha'Sa'ir is not Batel in Dam ha'Par, even though the bull has more blood. This teaches that Min b'Mino is never Batel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we learn from the bloods, and not from the Zero'a (which is Batel)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Zero'a is a Chidush (we Mevatel an Isur l'Chatchilah), so we may not learn from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should not learn from it that an Isur (that cannot be tasted) is Batel in 60 or 100 parts of Heter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may not learn leniencies from a Chidush. Requiring 60 or 100 parts is a stringency;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mid'Oraisa, an Isur is Batel in any majority!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Regarding other Kodshim, Ta'am k'Ikar (if Isur mixed with Heter can be tasted, the Heter is forbidden.) Here, Ta'am k'Ikar of the Zero'a (absorbed in the ram) is Batel.</p></div>
