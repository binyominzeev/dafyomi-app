<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OLAS HA'OF AND CHATAS HA'OF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> "Like the law" refers to the law of a Chatas ha'Of.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like he holds the head and body of a Chatas and sprinkles blood, he does the same with an Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does that mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like regarding Chatas ha'Of, when he holds the head, he sprinkles blood with the body (which is attached), also regarding Olas ha'Of.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like in Chatas ha'Of they are attached by a full Siman, also in Olas ha'Of!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "He will offer it." (Olas ha'Of is not offered like Chatas ha'Of.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since Chachamim (the first Tana, bottom of 21a) learn from "u'Malak... v'Hiktir" that the head and body of Olas ha'Of are separated, why do they need "and he will offer it" (to teach that it is unlike Chatas ha'Of)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If not for "And he will offer it", we would have learned that Olas ha'Of is like Chatas ha'Of;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"U'Malak... v'Hiktir" would teach that just like it is burned on top of the Mizbe'ach, also Melikah is done there.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since it says "And he will offer it", we learn both (separation and Melikah on top of the Mizbe'ach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Chatas Behemah cannot come from Ma'aser money?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> "Aharon will offer hisChatas" - his, and not of the congregation; his, and not from Ma'aser money.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim learn that Olas ha'Of is offered by day from "like the law." Why don't they learn from "on the day He commanded"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, they do. There was no need for the Beraisa to say that Chachamim (could) learn from "like the law".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim learn that Olas ha'Of is offered with the right hand from "like the law." Why don't they learn like Rabah bar bar Chanah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Wherever the Torah says "finger" or "Kohen", the right hand is required.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like R. Shimon, who says that '"finger" teaches that the right hand is required, but "Kohen" does not. (It does not say 'finger' regarding Olas ha'Of.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> From where do Chachamim and R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon learn that Melikah of an Olah is on back of the neck?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Melikah-Melikah".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>OLAS HA'OF AND CHATAS HA'OF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The (age of) Turim (turtledoves) acceptable for Korbanos are Pasul for doves. The doves acceptable as Korbanos are Pesulim among Turim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>When they start to get yellow, both species are Pesulim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Adult Turim are Kesherim, but young Turim are not. Young doves are Kesherim, but old doves are not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Kosher age of Turim is Pasul for doves. The Kosher age of doves is Pasul for Turim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Adult Turim are Kesherim, but not young ones.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should learn a Kal va'Chomer! Adult doves are Pesulim, but young ones are Kesherim. Regarding Turim, adults are Kesherim, so all the more so young ones are!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Turim" refers to adults, and not young ones.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> Young doves are Kesherim, but not old ones.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should learn a Kal va'Chomer! Young Turim are Pesulim, but old ones are Kesherim. Regarding doves, young ones are Kesherim, so all the more so adults are!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Bnei Yonah (children of doves)" refers to young ones, and not adults.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does this disprove the Kal va'Chomer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If both were Kesherim, at least once the Torah should have written 'children of Turim' or 'doves' (and not "children of doves").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding doves, the Torah says "children of doves", so only young ones are Kesherim. Regarding Turim, young and old should be Kesherim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Turim are like doves. Just like only young doves are Kesherim, only old Turim are Kesherim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps all Turim and doves are Kesherim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One offers "from the Turim", but not any Tur, and "from the children of doves", but not any dove;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>These exclude the beginning of yellowness (of the feathers), which is Pasul for both.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the minimal age of Turim to be Kesherim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is when their feathers start to turn gold.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> At what age do doves become Pesulim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is when they start to turn yellow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Yakov Karchah - Beraisa):</span> The minimal age of doves to be Kesherim is when Ya'ala'u.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Yakov Karchah):</span> "His chicks Ya'ala'u blood" teaches that Ya'ala'u means when the bird bleeds when one plucks a feather from it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AGES THAT ARE NOT VALID FOR BOTH TYPES OF BIRDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If one said 'it is Alai (encumbent upon me) to bring an Olah, a Tur or dove', and he brought a bird at the beginning of yellowing of each species, did he fulfill his vow?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Are we in doubt (if this age is considered young or old), and he fulfilled his vow with one or the other?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, is this an intermediate age that is Pasul for both?</p></div>
