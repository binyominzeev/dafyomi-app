<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE TUMAH OF ACHBARIM (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ha'Shoretz" - everywhere it creeps, it is Tamei. (This includes at sea, for it swims.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should expound this to say "ha'Mashritz (which breeds)," to exclude the Achbar that comes from earth!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Logic refutes this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Chuldah is Tamei, just like an Achbar. Just like everything called Chuldah is Tamei, also every Achbar, even one that comes from earth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We can learn oppositely!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like a Chuldah procreates, also an Achbar. This excludes one that comes from earth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Ba'Sheretz" (is extra, to include it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "ba'Sheretz" indeed includes the Achbar that comes from earth, and "ha'Shoretz" teaches that a sea mouse is Tamei at sea! ("Al ha'Aretz" would teach that all Achbarim are Tamei only on land.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Either way, something at or from the sea is Tamei. Therefore, it is unreasonable to be Metamei an Achbar on land and be Metaher it at sea.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need "Al ha'Aretz" for a different teaching!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> "Al ha'Aretz" is Metaher cases of Safek floating Tum'ah (of Sheratzim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Two verses say "Al ha'Aretz."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SPECIES RELATED TO TZAV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Veha'Tzav (frog or turtle) l'Minehu" includes Arod and Nefilim (types of lizards) and Salamandra;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> "How great are Your deeds, Hash-m" - You have great creatures at sea and at land. If either type would go to the other habitat, they would die immediately.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Hash-m made creatures that live in fire (Salamandra), others in air. If either type would go to the other habitat, they would die immediately.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Every species on land has a corresponding species at sea, except for a Chuldah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> We learn from "hearken, all dwellers of Cheled (the dry land)." (This hints that Chuldos live only on land.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) - (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Beavers of Narash do not dwell on land, rather in water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) - (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Residents of Narash are uncivilized. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Everyone in Narash should be excommunicated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> "Land, land, land, hear the word of Hash-m" - the people in Narash did not want to listen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If someone of Narash kisses you, he probably wants to steal your teeth;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If someone of Nahar Pekod escorts you, he probably wants to steal your garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If someone of Pumbadisa escorts you, he probably wants to steal from you at night. You should change your lodging.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Tursa):</span> I once went to a place where the people raise Kil'ayim. I saw a snake mate with a Tzav. An Arod was born (and killed people).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon ha'Chasid:</span> Since they brought new creations into the world, Hash-m did the same to them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Two species can have children together or nurse each other if and only if they have relations in the same position, and have the same gestation period! (Snakes are born after seven years, and Tzav after six months.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> It was a double miracle (that a child was born).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This was a punishment!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was a double miracle to bring punishment.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DANGLING LIMBS AND FLESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Dangling limbs or flesh of an animal receive Tum'as Ochlim (while dangling). They require Hechsher;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">127b----------------------------------------127b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the animal is slaughtered, the blood is Machshir them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Meir says, if the animal dies, the meat requires Hechsher. The limb is (Tamei like) Ever Min ha'Chai, but not like a limb of a Nevelah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon is Metaher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The dangling limb or meat has Tum'as Ochlim, but not Tum'as Nevelah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the limb or meat can heal (resume to be a live part of the animal), it should not have Tum'as Ochlim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it cannot heal, it should have also Tum'as Nevelah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it cannot heal. Regarding Nevelah it says "when will fall (from their carcasses)" - it is not Tamei until it fully falls off.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a limb or flesh of an animal that is dangling by a hair has Tum'as Nevelah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "When will fall" - it is not Tamei until it fully falls off;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Nevertheless, it receives Tum'as Ochlim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>This supports R. Chiya bar Ashi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> If figs dried up on the tree, they receive Tum'as Ochlim. One who picks them on Shabbos is liable. (This shows that even something considered attached can receive Tum'as Ochlim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The following also supports R. Chiya bar Ashi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If vegetables such as cabbage or gourd dried up while attached, they do not receive Tum'as Ochlim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they were detached and dried up, they receive Tum'as Ochlim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That cannot be. If they dried up, they are like wood. They do not receive Tum'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> The Beraisa means that if they were detached with intention to dry them, they receive Tum'as Ochlim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Only vegetables such as cabbage or gourd, which dry up to the point of being inedible, do not receive Tum'as Ochlim (while attached). Other vegetation receives Tum'ah while attached.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the stems dried, it need not say that they are Tahor!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the stems are not dry. Even so, other vegetation receives Tum'ah while attached. (This supports R. Chiya bar Ashi.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, the stems are dry;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Chidush of the Beraisa is the Seifa. If they were detached with intention to dry them, they receive Tum'as Ochlim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a branch of a tree was cut off; fruits on the branch are considered detached;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If (attached) fruits dried up, they are considered attached.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like in the Reisha, they are considered detached in all respects, also in the Seifa, they are considered attached in all respects (unlike R. Chiya bar Ashi)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the clauses are dissimilar. In the Seifa, they receive Tum'as Ochlim as if they were detached.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>IS THE DANGLING LIMB HUCHSHAR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the animal was slaughtered (R. Meir says that Dam Shechitah is Machshir the limb or meat. R. Shimon says, it is not.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> R. Meir holds that an animal can be considered a Yad for a single limb. R. Shimon holds that it cannot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> R. Meir considers semi-attached foods to be like one, even if when one holds the smaller food the larger one will break off. R. Shimon holds that they are not like one.</p></div>
