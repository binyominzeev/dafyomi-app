<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN MAY WE CAUSE <i>KODSHIM</i> TO BE WASTED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Indeed, he allows this l'Chatchilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Abaye - Mishnah #1 - R. Yishmael (some texts - R. Shimon)):</span> Kohanim may eat Kodshim however they want, e.g. roasted, overcooked or cooked. They may mix in spices of Chulin or Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Terumah of spices is only mid'Rabanan, therefore, we are not concerned lest it becomes Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Abaye - Mishnah #2):</span> We may not buy Terumah with money of Ma'aser Sheni, for this limits the consumption (Rashi - now, the Terumah must be eaten in Yerushalayim; Tosfos - now, only Kohanim may eat the Ma'aser);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon permits this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rava could not answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Abaye reported this dialogue to Rav Yosef.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> You could have asked from another Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah #3):</span> We may not cook Shemitah vegetables in Terumah oil, lest the Terumah become Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon permits this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> I asked from Mishnah #1, and he answered that Terumah of spices is different, for it is only mid'Rabanan. He would answer Mishnah #3 similarly, that it discusses Terumah mid'Rabanan (Shitah Mekubetzes - e.g. sesame oil).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> If Mishnah #3 discussed Terumah of vegetables (which is always mid'Rabanan) and Shemitah oil, you would be right. However, it discusses Terumah oil (which is usually from olives, which is mid'Oraisa) and Shemitah vegetables!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Rabanan asked (end of 75b) from our Mishnah, and he answered that R. Shimon permits only if they already became mixed. He would answer Mishnah #3 similarly, that it discusses Terumah and Shemitah that were already mixed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> If they were already mixed, why do Chachamim forbid cooking them together? Do they equate this to an Asham mixed with a Shelamim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>That is different, for there is a solution (Ro'im), therefore we do not cause Kodshim to be wasted. Here, in any case the Terumah must be eaten with the stringencies of Shemitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This case (Terumah mixed with Shemitah) is like a mixture of pieces of Kodshei Kodoshim and Kodshim Kalim. All agree that all must be eaten with the stringencies of the more stringent one!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> A mixture of pieces of Kodshei Kodoshim and Kodshim Kalim is different, for there is no alternative. If Terumah oil was mixed with Shemitah vegetables, the oil can be squeezed out of the vegetables!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yosef holds that it is not feasible to squeeze out the oil;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we squeeze out a lot (to get out all the oil), this will ruin the vegetables (and one may not ruin Shemitah produce);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we squeeze out a little, some Terumah oil will remain, and it might become wasted (when Bi'ur comes)!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>TAHARAH</i> OF A <i>SAFEK METZORA</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> (A Nazir became Safek Tamei Mes. Additionally, he was a Metzora Muchlat (he was declared fully Tamei due to Tzara'as, and now it healed), but he is unsure if he must perform Taharas Metzora or if he already fulfilled it. He brings Tziporim (birds) today for the first step of Taharah. On day 30, he shaves all his hair.) The next day, he brings a (lamb for) Asham Metzora and a Log of oil, and stipulates:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If I need to bring Asham Metzora, this is the Asham and the oil that must be brought with it. If I need not bring it, this lamb is a Shelamim;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">76b----------------------------------------76b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It must be slaughtered in the north (perhaps it is an Asham). Some of the blood must be put on his ear, thumb and toe (like Asham Metzora). It requires Semichah (some say that he does not do a proper Semichah, for Asham Metzora does not require Semichah mid'Oraisa, so he may not lean on the Korban), Nesachim (an accompanying flour and wine offering. Semichah and Nesachim are needed whether it is an Asham Metzora or Shelamim) and Tenufah (waving) of Chazeh v'Shok (the chest and thigh, in case it is a Shelamim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It may be eaten for only one day and the following night (in case it is an Asham. Shelamim should be permitted for two days!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Normally, R. Shimon does not permit wasting Kodshim l'Chatchilah.) This is an exception. It is permitted for his Tikun. (There is no other way for him to become absolutely Tahor to eat Kodshim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This explains why we may offer the Asham. Why may we do (Safek) Avodah with the oil? Perhaps it is unnecessary, and this is Chulin b'Azarah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He stipulates that if he does not need Taharas Metzora, the oil is Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is Nedavah, a Kometz must be taken!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we take a Kometz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he is a Metzora, seven Haza'os of oil are required!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do seven Haza'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [Since Kemitzah was taken,] a full Log does not remain!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We add more to restore the Shi'url</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Log is diminished before putting on the ear, thumb and toe, we add more to restore the Shi'ur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is Nedavah, we must burn the Kometz on the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we burn it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When do we burn it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If this is after the Haza'os, some of the Shirayim (leftovers) after Kemitzah are missing before Haktarah. Haktarah is forbidden in such a case!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If this is before the Haza'os, this forbids doing Haza'ah, for (Haza'ah is like Haktarah, and) "Lo Saktiru" (do not burn) applies to Shirayim of anything that is partially burned on the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> (Even) before the Haza'os, we may not burn the Kometz. Since we will do Haza'os, the oil is like a Korban, and "Lo Saktiru" applies to it (according to R. Akiva). (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah brei d'R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> He burns it, and stipulates that if this is unnecessary, it is l'Shem Etzim (like burning wood on the Mizbe'ach, i.e. not an obligatory Avodah. Rashi - this means that he sprinkles with intent 'if this is unnecessary, this is like sprinkling water.')</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> "L'Re'ach Nicho'ach" - you may not offer (Chametz or honey (i.e. any sweet derivative of fruit) on the Mizbe'ach) to fulfill Hash-m's will, but they may be burned l'Shem Etzim.</p></div>
