<p class="dedicationbox">ZEVACHIM 100 (10 Av) - Dedicated by Rabbi Kornfeld's mother, Mrs. G. Kornfeld, in memory of her father, Reb Yisrael Shimon ben Shlomo ha'Levi Turkel. Isi Turkel loved Torah and worked to support it with, literally, his last ounce of strength. He passed away on 10 Av 5740. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN DOES <i>PESACH</i> OVERRIDE <i>ANINUS LAYLAH</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Mari):</span> If the death and burial of the relative were on the 14th, the Onen does not bring Pesach. If the death was on the 13th and burial was on the 14th, the Onen brings Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If both were on the 14th, he does not bring Pesach, for Aninus applies mid'Oraisa to the night following death;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the death was on the 13th, he brings Pesach, for Aninus applies only mid'Rabanan to the night following burial. (Chachamim did not decree to stop him from bringing Pesach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Surely I am right. Chachamim taught that an Onen immerses and eats Pesach at night, but not other Kodshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to you (Rav Mari), R. Yehudah could reply 'I said only that Aninus of the night after the death is mid'Oraisa. I agree that Aninus of the night after the burial is mid'Rabanan (like Yom Kevurah itself!)'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Abaye):</span> In both cases, the relative died on the 14th;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he died before Chatzos (midday, Aninus took effect before the obligation to bring Korban Pesach), the Onen must become Tamei (through his Mes), so he does not bring Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he died after Chatzos (the obligation to bring Pesach preceded and overrides Aninus), the Onen brings Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(The following contradiction supports Abaye, for we must answer it like Abaye.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "Lah Yitama" is a Mitzvah (for a regular Kohen to become Tamei by engaging in the burial of (one of his seven close relatives, e.g.) his unmarried sister);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he does not want to become Tamei, we force him;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The wife of Yosef ha'Kohen died on Erev Pesach, and he did not want to become Tamei. The other Kohanim gathered and forced him to become Tamei against his will.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Contradiction (end of Beraisa #2; the entire Beraisa is brought below) Question: What do we learn from "ul'Achoso (a Nazir may not Metamei himself to bury his sister)"? (The verse already taught that he may not Metamei himself even for a parent!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches about one (Rashi - a Kohen Gadol Nazir; Tosfos Brachos 19b - a regular Yisrael) who was going to slaughter his Korban Pesach or circumcise his son, and he heard that a relative died. One might have thought that he is Metamei himself (and misses the other Mitzvah). The verse teaches that he does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It already says "Lo Yitama"! (Tosfos Brachos 19b - this is in the Parashah of Nazir. It is extra, to teach that a regular Yisrael may not become Tamei for a relative if it will prevent him from offering Pesach or Bris Milah, since there is Kares for neglecting these Mitzvos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that just like he may not Metamei himself for his sister, the same applies to a Mes Mitzvah. The verse refutes this. He may not become Tamei for a sister, but he may become Tamei for a Mes Mitzvah. (This is unlike the episode with Yosef ha'Kohen, which holds that Tum'as Kerovim overrides Korban Pesach!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If the relative died before Chatzos, he must be Metamei himself. If the relative died after Chatzos, he may not Metamei himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against support for Abaye, and Answer #2):</span> Perhaps in both Beraisos the Mes died after Chatzos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beraisa #2 is like R. Yishmael, who says that a Kohen is permitted but not obligated to become Tamei for relatives (therefore, this does not override his obligation to bring Pesach). Beraisa #1 is like R. Akiva, who says that a Kohen must Metamei himself for relatives (therefore, this overrides his obligation to bring Pesach now. He will bring Pesach Sheni);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> A Kohen is permitted but not obligated to Metamei himself to relatives;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Akiva says, he is obligated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This cannot be, for R. Akiva explicitly taught the Reisha of Beraisa #2!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Akiva):</span> (A Nazir may not become Tamei to bury "Nefesh Mes.") "Nefesh" refers to a relative. "Mes" refers to a stranger. (Tosfos prefers the text in Nazir, which switches these Drashos, for a relative is a bigger Chidush);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"L'Aviv" - he may not become Tamei for his father, but he becomes Tamei for a Mes Mitzvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"L'Imo" - a Kohen Nazir may not become Tamei for his mother, but he becomes Tamei for a Mes Mitzvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"L'Achiv" - a Kohen Gadol Nazir may not become Tamei for his brother, but he becomes Tamei for a Mes Mitzvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "ul'Achoso" teach?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one (a Kohen Gadol Nazir; some say, a regular Yisrael) was going to slaughter his Korban Pesach or circumcise his son, and he heard that a relative died, one might have thought that he becomes Tamei. "Ul'Achoso" teaches that he does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know this from "Lo Yitama"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that just like he may not become Tamei for his sister, also for a Mes Mitzvah. The verse teaches that he may not become Tamei for a sister, but he becomes Tamei for a Mes Mitzvah.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rava):</span> In both cases, the Mes died after Chatzos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he died before Shechitah and Zerikah of the Onen's Korban Pesach, the Onen does not bring Pesach (he is not Shalem);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he died after Shechitah and Zerikah, the Onen eats the Pesach at night!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Masnah):</span> If he died after Shechitah and Zerikah, the Onen already was Yotzei (offering Korban Pesach). Why does he eat at night (and transgress Aninus Laylah mid'Rabanan)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Eating (at least a k'Zayis of) Korban Pesach is Me'akev the Mitzvah of offering it (Rashi; Tosfos - it is not truly Me'akev. Rather, the Mitzvah to eat is so important that it overrides Aninus Laylah mid'Rabanan.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>YEMEI SHEMU'AH</i>, <i>KEVURAH</i> AND <i>LIKUT ATZAMOS</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We learn this from Rabah bar Rav Huna.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yom Shemu'ah (the day that one hears that he lost a relative) is like Yom Kevurah (the day of burial) regarding Aveilus. From this day, we count seven days (of severe Aveilus) and 30 days (of lighter Aveilus). It is like Yom Likut Atzamos (reinterment of the bones) regarding eating Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This and this have the same law. He immerses and eats Kodshim at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that Yom Shemu'ah is like Yom Kevurah regarding Aveilus and like Yom Likut regarding eating Pesach. This implies that Pesach may not be eaten the night after Yom Kevurah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, it also says '<i>this and this</i> (Yom Kevurah and Yom Likut) have the same law. He immerses and eats Kodshim at night!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> Different Tana'im taught these two clauses. (Below, we will bring a Beraisa in which Tana'im argue about the night after Yom Kevurah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> If a Shemu'ah, Likut or burial was before sunset, there is no Isur at night. He may eat any Kodshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Shemu'ah (or Likut or burial) was at night, this is Yom Shemu'ah (or Likut or Kevurah) itself;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>(Regarding Yom Kevurah itself, Chachamim decreed even against eating Pesach. Regarding Yom Shemu'ah or Likut, they decreed against eating other Kodshim, but not Pesach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Likut or Shemu'ah was at night, this was after Shechitah and Zerikah. He already was Yotzei Pesach. Why may he eat Pesach, but not other Kodshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Eating Pesach is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Beraisa means that Yom Shemu'ah and Yom Likut are the same. The Onen immerses and may eat Kodshim at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is wrong! The previous law discussed Yom Shemu'ah and Yom Likut. If also this law refers to them, it should have said '<i>these</i>' have the same law! (Instead, it says 'this and this', i.e. Yom Kevurah and Yom Likut.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which argument of Tana'im did Rav Chisda refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Aninus lasts the entire day;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi says, it is as long as the Mes is not buried.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is on the day of death.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely, all agree that Aninus lasts the entire day - "v'Acharisah k'Yom Mar"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> It refers to Yom Kevurah (which was after Yom Misah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> Yom Shemu'ah is like Yom Likut. He immerses and eats Kodshim at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Yom Kevurah is different. Then, Kodshim are forbidden even at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>According to Rav Sheshes, this is not like either Tana!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> The Beraisa means that Aninus lasts the entire day (of burial) <i>and the following night</i>;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rebbi says, it is as long as the Mes is not buried, but not the night after burial.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yirmeyah):</span> You cannot say that Rebbi is more lenient than Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Aninus lasts until (the night after) the Mes is buried, even if this is 10 days after death;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Chachamim say, it lasts until the day (of burial, not the next night.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The Beraisa means that Aninus lasts the entire day (of burial), but not the following night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>Rebbi says, no matter when the Mes is buried, Aninus takes effect on the following night.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p><i>ANINUS LAYLAH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Since Rebbi holds that Aninus takes effect on the night following burial (even though Yom Kevurah is only mid'Rabanan), he must hold that Aninus takes effect mid'Oraisa on the night following death!

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi holds that Aninus Laylah is not mid'Oraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Hen ha'Yom Hikrivu" - the Kodshim of the Milu'im were forbidden (to Aharon and his remaining sons, who were Onenim) during the day and permitted the next night;</p></div>
