<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> We must say that the airspace is like the Mizbe'ach. If not, how can we do Haza'as Dam of a Pasul Chatas ha'Of or Zerikas Dam of Pasul Zevachim (i.e. animals)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Once the blood leaves the bird or the bucket, it was Yored from the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the blood is put directly on the Mizbe'ach, without passing through the air.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> That is not Haza'ah (or Zerikah). It is Mitzuy (squeezing, or Shefichah (pouring))!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> That is not the normal way to do Haza'ah or Zerikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Conclusion:</span> We must say that the airspace is like the Mizbe'ach!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> If a Kohen is holding a Korban on the Mizbe'ach, surely it is as if the Korban is on the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The question is, is the Mizbe'ach Mekadesh something hanging on a reed in its airspace.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The question is unsettled.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>KLEI SHARES</i> ARE <i>MEKADESH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Klei Lach (Klei Shares that hold liquids) are Mekadesh (Kodshim) liquids. Dry measures are Mekadesh dry (Kodshim);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Klei Lach are not Mekadesh dry things, and dry measures are not Mekadesh liquids.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If Klei Kodesh became punctured, if they still perform their original (or a similar) function as when they were intact, they are Mekadesh. If not, they are not;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>All of these are Mekadesh only in the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> This applies only to (liquid) measures, but buckets (even though they hold liquids, i.e. blood) are Mekadesh dry;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn from the Menachos in the buckets that the Nesi'im donated - "Shneihem Mele'im Soles."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> A Minchah (of flour is kneaded with oil; it) is like a liquid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> Surely, some of the flour was not kneaded well and it is dry. We learn from the dry part.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> Compared to blood, a Minchah is considered dry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Shmuel):</span> Klei Shares are Mekadesh only if they are intact and full. They are Mekadesh only what is inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Shmuel):</span> Klei Shares are Mekadesh only if they are intact and full; they Mekadesh only Bifnim (Rashi - inside the Azarah; Tosfos - in the interior of the Kli, but not in a cavity hollowed out in its outer wall).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these versions?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Version #1 excludes a heaping excess (above the brim), Version #2 does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Klei Shares are Mekadesh only if they are intact and full; they Mekadesh only what is inside, Bifnim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> This is only if one does not intend to fill the measure. If he intends, every amount put inside immediately becomes Mekudash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "Mele'im" - Klei Shares are Mekadesh only if they hold the complete quantity;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi says, this is only if he does not intend to complete the measure. If he intends, every amount put inside immediately becomes Mekudash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mishnah):</span> Klei Lach are not Mekadesh...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav or Rav Asi):</span> They do not Mekadesh (dry) to be offered, but they Mekadesh it to become Pasul (if it will leave the Azarah, or a Tevul Yom (one who immersed today; he will be fully Tahor at nightfall) will touch it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa):</span> The following may not be brought from Meduma (Rashi - Terumah mixed with Chulin; Tosfos - a mixture forbidden to everyone, e.g. Orlah and Chulin), and all the more so not from Orlah or Kilai ha'Kerem:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Menachos, Nesachim, the Minchah brought with a Behemah, and Bikurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was brought, it is not Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav or Rav Asi):</span> It is not Kodesh to be offered, but it is Kodesh to become Pasul (i.e. it cannot be redeemed).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WE DO NOT REPAIR <i>KLEI SHARES</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Klei Kodesh became punctured, we do not fix them by melting them or pouring molten lead on them. (In the place of wealth (Hekdesh), there are no signs of poverty.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they became blunted, we do not fix them. If a knife became nicked, we do not sharpen it (Rashi - if the nick was so big that after sharpening, it will be recognizable that there was once a nick). If the handle came off, we do not return it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Aba Sha'ul says, there was a knife in the Mikdash that often became nicked (with small nicks) and disqualified Shechitah. They voted, and put it in Genizah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Bigdei Kehunah are not (made in parts, which are then) sewn (together) with a needle. Rather, they are woven (in one piece);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We may not launder Bigdei Kehunah in Ohel (aloe) or Neser (nitre).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that we may launder them in water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It means that if they are only slightly dirty and it would suffice to launder them in water, we may launder them in Ohel or Neser;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">88b----------------------------------------88b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If they are so dirty that they need to be laundered in Ohel or Neser, they may not be laundered even in water;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Some say, they may never be laundered. In the place of wealth, there are no signs of poverty.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p><i>BIGDEI KEHUNAH</i> BRING KAPARAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Me'il was made entirely of (wool dyed with) Techeiles - "va'Ya'as Es Me'il ha'Efod... Kelil Techeiles";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The bottom was made of (three different colors of wool -) Techeiles, Argamon (purple) and Tola'as Shani (red) twined together, and the forms of pomegranates with closed mouths, like buttons that children hang from their hats;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Seventy-two bells with clappers are hung (our text, Ramban (Chumash) - in the pomegranates; Rashi, presumably he had the text of Shitah Mekubetzes - each between two pomegranates), 36 in front and 36 in back.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Dosa says, there were 36, 18 in front and 18 in back.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eineini bar Sason):</span> They argue similarly about Tzara'as:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Dosa bar Hurkinus):</span> There are 36 Tamei colors of Tzara'as (in all, including Tzara'as of clothing and houses);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Akavya ben Mehalalel says, there are 72.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Eineini bar Sason):</span> Why did the Torah write the Parshah of Korbanos next to that of Bigdei Kehunah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that just like Korbanos Mechaper, also Bigdei Kehunah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Kesones atones for murder - "va'Yitbelu Es ha'Kutones ba'Dam" (the Ketones will be a Tevilah, i.e. Kaparah, for blood(shed));</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Michnesayim atone for Giluy Arayos - "...Michnesei Vad Lechasos (i.e. cover up) Besar Ervah";</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> It is proper that something worn at the highest place (the head) atones for elevating oneself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>The Avnet atones for thoughts of the heart, for it is worn there.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>The Choshen atones for (improper) judgment - "v'Asisa Choshen <i>Mishpat</i>".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>The Efod atones for idolatry - "v'Ein Efod u'Srafim." (This implies that when there is an Efod, there is no (liability for) Terafim (idols).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>The Me'il atones for Lashon ha'Ra.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> It is proper that something with a voice (the bells on the Me'il are heard when the Kohen Gadol walks) atones for misuse of voice.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p>The Tzitz atones for audacity - "v'Hayah Al Metzach Aharon";</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught that there are two things that Korbanos do not atone for, i.e. murder and Lashon ha'Ra. The Torah gave other Kaparos for them:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Eglah Arufah atones for murder, and Ketores atones for Lashon ha'Ra.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanina):</span> What is the source that the Ketores atones (for Lashon ha'Ra)?</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we know the murderer, we kill him! (No other Kaparah is needed.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, we cannot execute him for he (was Mezid, but he) was not warned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 2 (regarding Lashon ha'Ra):</span> The Ketores atones for covert Lashon ha'Ra, and the Me'il atones for Lashon ha'Ra said in public.</p></div>
