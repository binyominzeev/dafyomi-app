<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Shechitah must be l'Shem ha'Korban (with intent for that Korban, e.g. Olah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Im Zevach Shelamim" - he must be Zove'ach (slaughter) it l'Shem Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is called 'Zevach', and the word does not teach about its Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "ha'Makriv Es Dam ha'Shelamim" and "ha'Zorek Es Dam ha'Shelamim." This shows that 'Zevach' is not part of its name.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the other Avodos must be Lishmah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from Shechitah, for it has a stringency. Shechitah of a Korban Pesach on behalf of people who cannot eat from it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Partial answer:</span> "Ha'Makriv Es Dam ha'Shelamim" teaches that Kabalah (catching the blood in a Keli Sares) must be l'Shem Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Torah had to teach about Kabalah, why did it need "v'Im Zevach Shelamim" to teach that Shechitah must be Lishmah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from Kabalah (to slaughter). Kabalah has a stringency, that a Zar (non-Kohen) or a female Kohen cannot receive the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have learned that Shechitah and Kabalah must be Lishmah. What is the source for Zerikah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from Shechitah and Kabalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from these, for they have stringencies. They can be done only in the north half of the Azarah (for Kodshei Kodoshim), and they apply to inner Chata'os (those whose blood is offered in the Heichal. They do not have Zerikah on the outer Altar.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ha'Zorek Es Dam ha'Shelamim" teaches that the blood must be thrown l'Shem Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Torah had to teach about Zerikah, why did it need verses to teach about Shechitah and Kabalah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from Zerikah, for it has a stringency. A Zar who does Zerikah is Chayav Misah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have learned all the Avodos except Holachah (taking the blood to the Altar). What is the source for Holachah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from the other Avodos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from them, for they are essential, but sometimes Holachah is not necessary (if Shechitah was done right by the Altar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Hikriv ha'Kohen Es ha'Kol v'Hiktir ha'Mizbechah" refers to taking the limbs (of an Olah) to the ramp (of the Mizbeach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Hikrivu" refers to Kabalah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Torah taught this with an expression of Holachah to teach that Holachah has the laws of Kabalah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>AVODAH</i> MUST BE FOR THE SAKE OF THE OWNER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have shown that Shinuy Kodesh (intent for the wrong Korban) is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is the source to forbid Shinuy Ba'alim (Shechitah with intent to atone (do Zerikah)) for someone other than the owner)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Pinchus brei d'Rav Ami):</span> "U'Vesar Zevach Todas Shelamav" - the Zevichah (Shechitah) must be with intent for a Todah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since we already learned this (above), we use this verse to forbid Shinuy Ba'alim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This verse is used to teach another law!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Chavin):</span> "U'Vesar Zevach Todas Shelamav" teaches that if a Todah was slaughtered l'Shem Shelamim, it is Kosher. If a Shelamim was slaughtered l'Shem Todah, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the cases?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Todah is called a Shelamim (it is a type of Shelamim), but a (regular) Shelamim is not called a Todah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Todas Shelamav" teaches that Todah is called a Shelamim. We learn Shinuy Ba'alim from "Zevach".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, the verse is used to teach another law!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Chatas and Asham may be eaten only for one day and the following night?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>Zevach</i> (Todas Shelamav may be eaten for one day and the following night)"is extra to teach that the same applies to Chatas and Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had he Torah wanted to teach only that law, it would have said 'u'Vesar Todas Shelamav Zevach';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it says 'Zevach' before Todah to teach also about Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have shown that Shinuy Ba'alim applies to Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is the source that it applies to all the Avodos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from Shechitah. Shechitah has a stringency, that Shechitah of a Pesach on behalf of people who cannot eat from it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Torah teaches that Shinuy Kodesh applies to Shechitah, and also to all four Avodos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Likewise, the Torah teaches that Shinuy Ba'alim applies to Shechitah, and also to all four Avodos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from Shinuy Kodesh. It is more stringent than Shinuy Ba'alim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shinuy Kodesh is a Pesul in the Korban itself. It <i>intrinsically</i> applies to all four Avodos (whereas Shinuy Ba'alim applies only if an Avodah was done with intent to do Zerikah for the wrong owner), it applies after the owner died, and it applies to Korbanos Tzibur (i.e. of the congregation) as well as Korbanos of individuals.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Even though two of these stringencies can be refuted (we will do so immediately), the other two cannot, so we cannot learn from Shinuy Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Surely, we say that Shinuy Ba'alim is not a Pesul in the Korban itself because it is merely improper intent. The same applies to Shinuy Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> According to Rav Pinchus brei d'Rav Mari, who says that Shinuy Ba'alim applies after the owner died, Shinuy Kodesh is not more stringent in this respect!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Two of the stringencies remain, so we cannot learn from Shinuy Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> "V'Nirtzah Lo Lechaper Alav", but not to atone (do Zerikah) for someone else.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This verse is used to teach the following!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> "V'Nirtzah Lo Lechaper <i>Alav</i>" - one has Acharayus for a Korban that is Alav (on him, i.e. a Neder. He said 'it is Alai to bring...' If it becomes lost or stolen or blemished, he must bring another);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is not Alav (a Nedavah, he said 'this is an Olah'), he has no Acharayus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Avdimi):</span> When he says Alai, he accepts responsibility to bring it no matter what happens.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Ashi learned from "v'Nirtzah Lo Lechaper" (without 'Alav').</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SOURCES FOR <i>KABALAH</i> AND <i>HOLACHAH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have learned that Shinuy Ba'alim applies to slaughter and Zerikah. What is the source for Kabalah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from Shechitah and Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from these, for they have a stringency. One who does them (to a Korban) outside the Mikdash is Chayav Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> We learn from Ayil (the ram of a) Nazir. "<i>Ya'aseh</i> Zevach Shelamim" - it must be <i>Asuy</i> (offered) like a Shelamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since we do not need this to teach about Shinuy Kodesh, we use it to teach about Shinuy Ba'alim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Aba):</span> We should say that 'Ya'aseh' is a Klal (general term), 'Zevach' is a Prat (specific term), and from a Klal u'Frat we only learn the Prat, i.e. Zevichah (Shechitah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Had it said 'Ya'aseh Shelamim Zevach', that would be correct;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it says "Ya'aseh Zevach Shelamim." The Prat (Zevach) interrupts the Klal (before the Klal was explained, i.e. how it should be offered). In such a case, the rule of Klal u'Frat does not apply.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> Really, we expound such a Klal u'Frat;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Here, "la'Shem" is a closing Klal... (so it is a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Interjection (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> The opening and closing Klalim are dissimilar! The opening Klal (Ya'aseh) teaches only Asiyos (the four Avodos, i.e. Shechitah, Kabalah, Holachah and Zerikah). The closing Klal (la'Shem) teaches all Avodos to Hash-m, even pouring the extra blood on the base of the Mizbeach, and burning Chelev on the Mizbeach!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael, who expounds such a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion of answer:</span> From a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal we learn everything similar to the Prat;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Prat is an Avodah, and it must be done Lishmah. Likewise, all four Avodos must be done Lishmah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> The Prat is an Avodah for which one is Chayav Kares outside the Mikdash. We can learn only to other such Avodos (Zerikah), but not to Kabalah and Holachah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> The Prat is an Avodah which (for Kodshei Kodoshim) must be done in the north half of the Azarah and applies to inner Chata'os. We can learn only to other such Avodos (Kabalah), but not to Zerikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Conclusion:</span> Both objections are equally valid. There is no reason to learn one more than the other, therefore we learn both (Zerikah and Kabalah; Kabalah includes Holachah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Conclusion:</span> Both objections are equally valid. We cannot learn both, therefore we do not learn either.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #3 - Conclusion:</span> We already learned Zerikah from Rav Ashi, therefore the Klal u'Frat u'Chlal comes to teach about Kabalah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR THE LAWS OF <i>LISHMAH</i> BY OTHER <i>KORBANOS</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have shown that Shinuy Kodesh and Shinuy Ba'alim apply to Eil Nazir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is the source for other Korbanos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from Eil Nazir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot, for it has a stringency. Other Korbanos are brought with it (a Chatas and Olah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah said "(Ya'aseh Zevach) Shelamav", we would only learn Eil Nazir;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it says "Shelamim", to include all Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have shown that Shinuy Kodesh applies to Shelamim;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from Shelamim, for it requires Semichah (pressing on the neck of the Korban), Nesachim (an accompanying offering of (flour and) wine), and Tenufah (waving) of the chest and foreleg.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Zos ha'Torah la'Olah la'Minchah vela'Chatas vela'Asham vela'Milu'im ul'Zevach ha'Shelamim" equates all Korbanos to Shelamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like Shinuy Kodesh and Shinuy Ba'alim apply to Shelamim, also to all Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they are Pasul if slaughtered Lo Lishman!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection - Question:</span> "Motza Sefasecha Tishmor v'Asisa Ka'asher Nadarta... Nedavah" - why does the Torah call a Neder 'Nedavah'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If you did like you Nadar (vowed, i.e. the Zevach was offered Lishmah), it is a Neder (you fulfilled your obligation). If not, it is a Nedavah (you did not fulfill your vow).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The Torah must teach both verses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it said only "Motza Sefasecha...", we would not know that Avodah Lo Lishmah is not considered doing like he vowed. Therefore, it says also "Zos ha'Torah...";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it said only "Zos ha'Torah...", one might have thought that Avodah Lo Lishmah disqualifies all Korbanos. Therefore, it says also "Motza Sefasecha...".</p></div>
