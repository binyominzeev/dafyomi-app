<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE LAST THREE <i>MATANOS</i> OF A <i>CHATAS</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we can prove this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> The following apply to blood that must be put on the Yesod:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It must be washed, intent (Chutz) takes effect on it, and one is liable for it outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>None of these apply to blood that is poured into the Amah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The Beraisa must be R. Nechemyah, for he is Mechayev for Shirayim outside, and it says that Shirayim must be washed and intent takes effect on them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> The law of Shirayim and Eimurim is different (than blood that is Mechaper). Since they are not Me'akev Kaparah, intent does not take effect on them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and rejection of Answer (a)):</span> Beraisa #1 refers to blood of the last three Matanos of a Chatas. (Therefore, we have no source that R. Nechemyah obligates washing Shirayim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The last three Matanos are put on the Keranos. The Beraisa (#1) says that they are put on the Yesod!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that what remains of them is put on the Yesod.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Papa):</span> The Beraisa says that intent takes effect on it. [Rav Papa] said that what does not permit anything, intent in it is not Mefagel, and it does not (disqualify the Korban if it) enters the Heichal, like Shirayim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses blood of inner Chata'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One is exempt for offering the last three Matanos of outer Chata'os outside the Mikdash, and it need not be washed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did the Beraisa distinguish between (blood put on) the Yesod and (blood poured into) the Amah? It should have distinguished between inner and outer Chata'os!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is R. Nechemyah. He is Mechayav for Shirayim (even of outer Chata'os) outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He distinguished between the Yesod and the Amah, for these differ in all three respects (washing, intent and outside). He could not teach that Shirayim of inner and outer Chata'os differ in all three respects (since one is liable for both of them outside).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 2:d (38b) - Ravina):</span> The Mishnah said 'if blood splashed from the Keren or the Yesod...' This refers to blood that splashed off the Keren, or blood <i>Ra'uy for</i> the Yesod.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Tachlifa bar Gaza):</span> You should (be consistent and) say that it refers to blood Ra'uy for the Keren or for the Yesod!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The Mishnah would not need to teach both of them. If blood Ra'uy for the Keren need not be washed, all the more so blood Ra'uy for the Yesod need not!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BLOOD OF INNER <i>CHATA'OS</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Asah (he will offer Par He'elem Davar) Ka'asher Asah (like the Chatas of a Kohen Mashu'ach)" is a second command to perform all the Matanos, therefore, all are Me'akev. If one was omitted, the Par did not atone at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies only to the seven Haza'os (on the Paroches), for seven Haza'os are always Me'akev. What is the source that the four Matanos (on the Keranos of the inner Mizbe'ach) are Me'akev?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ken Ya'aseh." (The Beraisa proceeds to expound the entire verse.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>"La'Par" refers to the Par of Yom Kipur (that atones for the Kohanim.) "Ka'Asher Asah <i>la'Par</i>" refers to the Par Chatas of a Mashu'ach (for transgressing through his own mistaken Hora'ah). "Ha'Chatas" refers to Se'ir Avodah Zarah (brought if most of Yisrael transgressed idolatry due to a mistaken Hora'ah of the Great Sanhedrin.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Musaf of festivals and Rosh Chodesh includes a Sa'ir Chatas. Perhaps also it is included (in this verse, and it is offered like an inner Chatas)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (He will do) "Lo" (to it, Se'ir Avodah Zarah, but not to other Se'irim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> ("Ha'Chatas" and "Lo" do not connote one Sa'ir more than the other.) Why do we include Se'ir Avodah Zarah and exclude Se'irim of the festivals?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to include the former, for they atone for a known Aveirah (like Par He'elem Davar), whereas Se'irim of the festivals atone for Aveiros (of Tum'ah) that no one ever knew about.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>"V'Chiper" - even if the Zekenim did not do Semichah on it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>"V'Nislach" - even if the Shirayim were not put on the Yesod.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The verse did not specify which Avodos are Me'akev and which are not). Why do we say that Matanos are Me'akev, and Semichah and Shirayim are not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Wherever the Torah requires Haza'ah it is Me'akev. Semichah and Shirayim are (usually) not Me'akev.</p></div>
