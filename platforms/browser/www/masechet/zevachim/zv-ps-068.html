<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>COMPENSATION FOR IMPROPERLY OFFERED BIRDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If she does not remember what she gave to the Kohen, and he does not remember where he offered them, she must bring four Olos Nedavah (two of each species, to fulfill her vow), two Olos Chovah (one of each species - perhaps her Chatas was Kosher, she must bring a matching Olah), and a Chatas (of either species. This Tana holds that the Olah does not fix the Chatas. I.e. even if her Olas Chovah was offered properly above, she can bring now a Chatas of either species, and she already brought or brings now an Olas Chovah of the same species.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Ben Azai says, she brings (six Olos like above and) one Chatas of each species. (He holds that if the Olas Chovah was offered before the Chatas, she must bring a Chatas of the same species.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> (She should have fulfilled her obligation with four birds in all. Due to the mistakes and forgetting, she had to bring an extra seven or eight.) This is like people say, a live ram has only one voice, but (parts of) a dead ram gives seven voices (two Shofaros, two flutes, a tambourine, and strings for a lyre and harp. This culminates the proof that the Stam Mishnah is like R. Yehoshua.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Questions 2:d and 2:f, Daf 67b):</span> R. Yehoshua says that an Olah becomes a Chatas regarding (inhibiting) Me'ilah, but one is not Yotzei with it!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>MELIKAH PESULAH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If any Pasul (person) did Melikah, it is Pasul, but it is Metaher the bird from (becoming a Neveilah and having) Tum'as Beis ha'Beli'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>In the following cases, Melikah or Shechitah (even though it is Pasul) is Metaher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Melikah was done with the left hand, or at night; Chulin was slaughtered in the Azarah, or Kodshim were slaughtered outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The following cases of Melikah are not Metaher (the bird is Neveilah, and it has Tum'as Beis ha'Beli'ah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Melikah was done with a knife, on Chulin in the Azarah, or on Kodshim outside;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">68b----------------------------------------68b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Tor was too young, or a Ben Yonah was too old;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Its wing was dry (and ready to fall off), its eye was blind (Tosfos - gouged out), or its leg was cut off.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The general rule is, Melikah of any Pesul b'Kodesh (Tosfos - after it was Mekudash in a Kli Shares; alternatively, if the Pesul is Kosher for Kodshim in a different setting) is Metaher. If the Pesul was not b'Kodesh, there is Tum'as Beis ha'Beli'ah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> If Melikah was done with the left hand or at night, it is Metaher. If it was done by a Zar or with a knife, it is not Metaher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, (Melikah with) the left hand is Metaher because it is (sometimes) Kosher for Avodah, i.e. on Yom Kipur (the Kohen carries a spoon with Ketores in his left hand), and Melikah at night is Metaher because night is Kosher for Haktarah of limbs and Chelev;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Similarly, a Zar is Kosher for Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shechitah is not an Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Zeira taught that if a Zar slaughtered the Parah Adumah, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav taught that this is because it says "Elazar" (who was a Kohen) and "Chukah" (which shows that it is Me'akev).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Parah Adumah is different. It is Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis (but Kodshei Mizbe'ach do not require a Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If a Kohen is needed for (Shechitah of) Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis (for it is considered Avodah), all the more so this is needed for Kodshei Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> Just like a Kohen is needed to rule about Tzara'as, even though this is not Avodah, the same applies to Parah Adumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that since a Zar is Kosher for Avodah on a Bamah, his Melikah is Metaher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not learn from Bamos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do learn from Bamos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Yotzei (Eimurim that left the Mikdash) were brought back and up the ramp, we do not take them down (they are thrown on the Mizbe'ach), because Yotzei is Kosher on a Bamah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Tana relies on "Zos Toras ha'Olah" (to learn from Bamos about Avodos not involving the blood).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Melikah done by a Zar is Metaher, but Melikah done with a knife is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If <i>any</i> Pasul did Melikah, it is Pasul (but it is Metaher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to R. Yochanan, this comes to includes a Zar. According to Rav, what does it include?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes Melikah with the left hand or at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah teaches these explicitly!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah alludes to them, and then teaches them explicitly.</p></div>
