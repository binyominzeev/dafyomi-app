<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE STATUS OF THE OIL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Shirayim must be eaten, but oil was added after the Kometz was separated, and nothing permits the addition (and it is mixed with the Shirayim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We redeem the addition.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we redeem it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we redeem it in the Azarah, it becomes Chulin b'Azarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we redeem it outside the Azarah (and it was needed for Taharas Metzora, it is Kodshei Kodoshim), it becomes Pasul once it leaves the Azarah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, we redeem it in the Azarah. We did not enter Chulin into the Azarah. We entered Kodshim and redeemed it. It became Chulin automatically by itself!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon holds that one may not bring a Nedavah of oil! (Tosfos - presumably, he forbids it mid'Rabanan.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is permitted for the man's Tikun.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna bar Tachlifa):</span> He should stipulate that if he does not need Asham Metzora, it is an Asham Taluy (instead of Shelamim, for then we do not waste Kodshim. Also Asham Taluy is eaten only one day and a night!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion (Rav Huna):</span> R. Shimon must hold like the Chachamim who argue with R. Eliezer. They say that one brings Asham Taluy only when he has a real Safek that he transgressed Kares. It may not be brought voluntarily!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Ravina):</span> Such a stipulation is impossible. Asham Taluy must be in its second year, but Asham Metzora must be in its first year!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>LIMBS THAT BECAME MIXED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If limbs of a Chatas were mixed with limbs of an Olah, we burn all of them on the Mizbe'ach. (Even though one may not burn limbs of a Chatas l'Shem Re'ach Nicho'ach,) we consider the Chatas to be like wood;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, we wait for Ibur Tzurah (the next day, when they are Nosar), then all are burned in Beis ha'Sereifah (a place in the Mikdash for burning Pasul Kodshim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is R. Eliezer's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'El ha'Mizbe'ach Lo Ya'alu l'Re'ach Nicho'ach" - you may not offer on the Mizbe'ach (anything the Torah is not Machshir for a Korban) for Re'ach Nicho'ach, but it may be burned l'Shem Etzim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Chachamim expound "Osam" - only Chametz and honey are forbidden l'Re'ach Nicho'ach and permitted l'Shem Etzim. Other things are forbidden even l'Shem Etzim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer expounds "Osam" - the ramp ("El ha'Mizbe'ach") is considered like the Mizbe'ach only regarding (the Isur of offering) Chametz and honey, but not regarding other things.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim expound both from "Osam".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Our Mishnah is unlike the following Tana.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> R. Eliezer and Chachamim agree that we offer a mixture of Chatas and Olah limbs;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They agree that if limbs of a Rove'a or Nirva were mixed limbs of a Kosher Olah, they are not offered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They argue about limbs of two Olos, a Tam and a Ba'al Mum, that were mixed together;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Eliezer says that we offer both. We consider the limbs of the Ba'al Mum to be like wood;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Chachamim forbid offering either.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Eliezer forbids when a Rove'a or Nirva was mixed with a Kosher Korban, for the former may not be offered. Also a Ba'al Mum may not be offered!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">77b----------------------------------------77b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> The Mum discussed is Dukin (a film) in the eye. R. Eliezer holds like R. Akiva, who says that if such an animal was brought up the ramp, we offer it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva permits only b'Di'eved, if it was already brought up the ramp. He does not permit offering it l'Chatchilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Indeed, R. Eliezer and Chachamim argue in a case that the animals were already brought up the ramp.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, they should argue about offering such a Ba'al Mum without a mixture!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Eliezer learns from "Mum Bam" - one may not offer a Ba'al Mum by itself, but it may be offered among a mixture;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim expound "Mum Bam" - one may not offer while the Mum is there, but if the Mum goes away, it is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer learns both laws from this, for the Torah wrote "Bam" instead of "Bahem";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim hold that this does not warrant learning a second law.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does R. Eliezer say that we consider the limbs of the Ba'al Mum to be like wood? The Torah absolutely permits it (in the mixture)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He addresses Chachamim according to their reasoning;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>I absolutely permit it. I learn from "Mum Bam." Granted, you expound this differently, but you should agree that it may be offered like wood, just like (you agree about) limbs of a Chatas!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim forbid. Limbs of a Chatas are not despised, limbs of a Ba'al Mum are despised.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If limbs of Olos Kesheros became mixed with limbs of a Ba'al Mum, if one of the heads was offered, we offer all of them. If the Kerayim (bottoms of the legs) of one of them were offered, we offer all of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Chachamim say, even if all of them except for one were offered, the remaining one is burned in Beis ha'Sereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Elazar):</span> R. Eliezer only permits offering two at a time (since one of them is surely Kosher, we assume that the other is also), but not one at a time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah - Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> Even if all of them except for one were offered, the remaining one is burned in Beis ha'Sereifah (this implies that R. Eliezer argues, and permits offering the last one)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah bar Tachlifa):</span> They mean that even if all of them except for one <i>pair</i> were offered, the remaining pair is burned in Beis ha'Sereifah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BLOOD THAT BECAME MIXED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If blood became mixed with water, if it still looks like blood, it is Kosher (for Zerikah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If it became mixed with wine, we consider the wine to be like water (i.e. it is as if the blood became mixed with an equal amount of water)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If it became mixed with blood of a (Chulin) Behemah or Chayah, we consider the blood to be like water.</p></div>
