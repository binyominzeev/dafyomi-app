<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When the Mishkan was set up in Nov and (later in) Giv'on (Bamos were permitted... (Rashi's text - Ma'aser Sheni was permitted in all Arei Yisrael.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Ki Lo Vasem Ad Atah El ha'Menuchah v'El ha'Nachalah" - "Menuchah" refers to Shilo, and "Nachalah" refers to Yerushalayim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The verse teaches that Bamos will be permitted until Shilo.) Why does the verse also allude to Yerushalayim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Bamos were permitted in the period between Shilo and Yerushalayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> This implies that Kedushas Shilo lapsed when it was destroyed. If so, Ma'aser Sheni should have to be brought to Nov and Giv'on! (Rashi - the Mishnah permits it in all Arei Yisrael; Tosfos - why did the Tana omit this law?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> We learn Ma'aser Sheni from a Gezerah Shavah "Sham-Sham" from the Aron;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since the Aron was not in Nov and Giv'on, there was no need to bring Ma'aser Sheni there (or, it could not be eaten anywhere - Tosfos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, you should say the same about Pesach and Kodshim. Also they are learned from "Sham-Sham"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana is R. Shimon, who says that even the Tzibur offered only Pesach and Chovos that have a fixed time, but Chovos without a fixed time were not offered at all;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Ma'aser Behemah is a Chovah without a fixed time (so it was not offered), and Ma'aser Sheni is equated to Ma'aser Behemah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> According to R. Yehudah, Ma'aser Behemah was offered in Nov and Giv'on. Ma'aser Sheni had to be eaten there!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Confirmation:</span> This is correct!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> According to R. Yehudah, Ma'aser Sheni and Ma'aser Behemah were eaten in Nov and Giv'on.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They must be eaten in a Birah (building, i.e. Mikdash)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Rav Yosef recited a Beraisa that says there were three Biros: Shilo, Nov and Giv'on, and the Beis ha'Mikdash. (Rashi did not explain why the Biros of Nov and Giv'on are counted only like one. Perhaps it is because they, especially the Birah in Nov, stood for a short time.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Birah in Nov and Giv'on was for the sake of eating Ma'aser Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>HA'MENUCHAH VEHA'NACHALAH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When the Beis ha'Mikdash was built in Yerushalayim, Bamos were forbidden forever...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Yehudah):</span> "Ki Lo Vasem Ad Atah El ha'Menuchah v'El ha'Nachalah" - "Menuchah" refers to Shilo, and "Nachalah" refers to Yerushalayim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "Haysah Li Nachalasi k'Aryeh va'Ya'ar", and "ha'Ayit Tzavu'a Nachalasi Li ha'Ayit Saviv Aleha" (its enemies gather around it);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon says, "Menuchah" is Yerushalayim, and "Nachalah" is Shilo;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "Zos Menuchasi Adei Ad Po Eshev Ki Ivisiha", and "Vachar Hash-m b'Tziyon Ivah l'Moshav Lo".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, according to R. Yehudah the verse mentions Menuchah (an allusion to Shilo) before Nachalah (Yerushalayim, which was later). According to R. Shimon, the order should be reversed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse teaches that Bamos are permitted, for not only have you not reached Yerushalayim; rather, you have not even reached Shilo (but then, they will be forbidden).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Both of them refer to Shilo.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Yochai):</span> Both of them refer to Yerushalayim. (Apparently, Tana'im argue about R. Shimon's opinion, or R. Shimon retracted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, (both opinions in) Beraisa #1 hold(s) that Menuchah and Nachalah refer to different places;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">119b----------------------------------------119b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, (both opinions in) Beraisa #2 hold(s) that Menuchah and Nachalah refer to the same place. It should say 'ha'Menuchah veha'Nachalah.' Why does it say "<i>v'El</i> ha'Nachalah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, according to Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael, Shilo is called Menuchah because they rested from conquest,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is called Nachalah because that is where inheritances were apportioned - "va'Yashlech Lahem Yehoshua Goral b'Shilo".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to R. Shimon ben Yochai (in Beraisa #2), we understand why Yerushalayim is called Nachalah, for it is the eternal inheritance (dwelling of Shechinah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>However, why it is called Menuchah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is where the Aron rested - "...l'Nuchecha Atah va'Aron Uzecha" (perhaps this is the verse alluded to).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon ben Yochai holds that Bamos were permitted until Yerushalayim. If so, we understand "va'Yikach Mano'ach... va'Ya'al Al ha'Tzur la'Shem";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael (and the Tana'im in Beraisa #1) hold that Bamos were forbidden at this time (Shilo was standing)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was Hora'as Sha'ah. (Hash-m permitted it, just like he permitted Eliyahu to offer on Har ha'Karmel.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Both of these refer to Yerushalayim;</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>LIABILITY FOR <i>SHECHITAS CHUTZ</i> AND <i>HA'ALAS CHUTZ</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Korban (was Hukdash when Bamos were permitted and offered when Bamos were forbidden, he transgresses an Aseh and a Lav, but there is no Kares).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> There is no Kares for Shechitah, but there is Kares for Ha'alah (offering on a Bamah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (The Parshah of Ha'alah b'Chutz begins) "va'Aleihem Tomar..." We read this like 'va'Aleihem' (with an Ayin, i.e. it is a continuation of the previous Parshah, which discussed Shechutei Chutz of a Korban Hukdash when Bamos were permitted. There is no Kares for this.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rabah):</span> "Va'Aleihem" is written (and read) with an Aleph (tell to them, i.e. Bnei Yisrael...) It is not an addendum to the previous verse!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> There are four general rules about Kodshim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Korban was Hukdash, slaughtered and offered (b'Chutz) at a time of Isur (when Bamos were forbidden), he transgresses an Aseh and a Lav, and there is Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was Hukdash at a time of Heter and slaughtered and offered at a time of Isur, he transgresses an Aseh and a Lav, but there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If it was Hukdash at a time of Isur and slaughtered and offered at a time of Heter, he transgresses an Aseh, but there is no Lav or Kares;</p></div>
