<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MUST UNFINISHED GARMENTS BE LAUNDERED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> "Beged" teaches only that a 'Beged' must be laundered. (Rashi - Stam 'Beged' in the Torah refers to wool or linen. Rashi did not say this above when explaining R. Yehudah. Perhaps he holds like the opinion (Menachos 39b) that 'Beged' includes all materials);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include (garments of) Sak and all materials?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Asher Yizeh Aleha Techaves."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this includes hide after Hefshet!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Beged" connotes only things that are Mekabel Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between R. Elazar and R. Yehudah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> They argue about a patch less than three by three (fingers; Rambam - three Tefachim by three Tefachim):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah obligates laundering it, for it <i>can</i> be Mekabel Tum'ah (as is it now, once the owner intends to use it, e.g. to patch up a garment).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar exempts, for now it is not Mekabel Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> They argue even about a full garment, if he intends to decorate it before using it:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah obligates laundering it, for it can be Mekabel Tum'ah if he will (reconsider and) decide to use it as it is;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar exempts, for now it is not Mekabel Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> They argue about a cloth mat that intends to cut before using it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah obligates laundering it, for it can be Mekabel Tum'ah if he will decide to use it as it is;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar exempts, for now it is not Mekabel Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Menasiyah):</span> If one intends to cut a cloth mat before using it, it is not Mekabel Tum'ah until he cuts it (or decides to use it as it is).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Only the part of the garment that absorbed the blood must be laundered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if blood splashed on part of a garment, the entire garment must be laundered!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher Yizeh" - only the place of the blood must be laundered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Only garments proper Lekabel Tum'ah (and proper to be laundered...)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Our Stam Mishnah is like R. Yehudah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>'Proper to be laundered' excludes Kelim that are scraped, and not laundered (e.g. wood or metal).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHICH GARMENTS MUST BE LAUNDERED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The law of laundering is the same for cloth, Sak...(or leather...)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Laundering applies to leather.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #1):</span> (On Shabbos) if there was filth on a cloth, it may be wiped off with a rag;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there was filth on a leather pillow, one pours water over it until it gets clean. (If laundering applied, this would be forbidden!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Our Mishnah is like Chachamim, [who say that laundering does not apply to leather]. Mishnah #1 is like Acherim [who says that it does];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Dam Chatas splashed on Beged or Sak, it is laundered. If it splashed on a Kli (that is not laundered) or leather, it is scraped off;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Acherim say, if it splashed on Beged, Sak or leather, it is laundered. If it splashed on a Kli, it is scraped off.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to which Tana is the following episode?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Ashi:</span> Many times (on Shabbos) I shook Rav's shoes (in his presence) in water.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Surely, all agree that laundering applies to leather - "veha'Beged... Oh Chol Kli ha'Or Asher Techaves"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, the verse and our Mishnah discuss soft leather. The Tana'im argue about whether laundering applies to hard leather.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chiya (bar Ashi) often shook Rav's shoes in water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were hard shoes. He held like Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> I was wrong. The verse did not specify. Surely it applies even to hard, cooked leather!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (Rava):</span> The verse discusses all leather. Even if it was originally hard, since Tzara'as comes from the garment itself, this softens the garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If there was filth on a leather pillow, one pours water over it until it gets clean;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">94b----------------------------------------94b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Pillows are soft!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Laundering without rubbing (one side of the garment on the other) is not considered laundering.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chiya shook Rav's shoes in water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He shook them, but he did not rub them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the shoes were soft, all Tana'im agree to this (that one may not rub them);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they were hard, this was like Acherim. (Chachamim would permit even rubbing.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is not considered laundering without rubbing, the Mishnah should permit shaking a Beged in water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Soaking Beged in water is laundering.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>This is like Rava holds elsewhere;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one threw a turban into water (on Shabbos), he is liable. If one threw flax (some texts - flax seeds) into water, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, he is liable for the turban, for this is laundering;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Why is he liable for flax?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He is liable for seeding (for it will sprout).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he should be liable for throwing also wheat or barley!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is liable for flax (for kneading), for it has strands (the flax sticks together).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should be liable also for throwing skins (our text, Rashi; Tosfos - cress)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Flax becomes kneaded (but skins or cress do not).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One may launder shoes on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> R. Chiya <i>shook</i> Rav's shoes in water. He did not rub them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p>Rava publicly retracted. 'I erred. Shaking in water is permitted, but not rubbing.'</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>STRINGENCIES OF <i>CHATAS</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It must be laundered in the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> It says "Techabes b'Makom Kadosh."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Kli Cheres must be broken in the Azarah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "u'Chli Cheres Asher Tevushal Bo Yishaver."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a copper Kli must be scoured in the Azarah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Im bi'Chli Nechoshes Bushalah u'Morak v'Shutaf b'Mayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In <i>this</i> respect, Chatas is more stringent than other Kodshei Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions:</span> There are other stringencies!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If blood of an outer Chatas entered the Heichal, it is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Mishnah is R. Akiva, who says that this applies to all Zevachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Chatas atones for Chayavei Kerisus!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This does not apply to all Chata'os, e.g. to the Chatas for Shevu'as ha'Edus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> Dam Chatas requires four Matanos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Mishnah is R. Yishmael, who says that this applies also to (most) Zevachim (i.e. those that require Matanos on opposite edges of the Mizbe'ach. He requires a separate Matanah on each of the two sides that meet at each edge.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (to all these answers):</span> Surely, there are other stringencies. Dam Chatas must be put on the Keren or the edge, and with the finger!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Questions 1-3):</span> You must say that the Mishnah mentions one of the stringencies.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>BRINGING A GARMENT TO THE <i>AZARAH</i> TO BE LAUNDERED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If blood splashed onto a garment and it left the Azarah, we return it to the Azarah and launder it there;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If this same garment became Tamei outside the Azarah, we tear it (to be Metaher it), return it to the Azarah, and launder it there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If Chatas was cooked in a Kli Cheres and it left the Azarah, we return it and break in the Azarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it became Tamei outside the Azarah, we puncture it, return it and break it in the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If Chatas was cooked in a copper Kli and it left the Azarah, we return it and do Merikah u'Shtifah in the Azarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it became Tamei outside, we make a big hole in it, return it and scour it in the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Ravina) Question:</span> If we tear the garment, there is no Mitzvah to launder it. The Torah commands about a Beged!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We tear it, but we leave connected enough cloth to make a turban. (Therefore, regarding laundering, it is still considered a Beged.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Huna taught that if enough cloth remains connected to make a turban, it remains Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mid'Oraisa it is Tahor. It is Tamei mid'Rabanan. (Chachamim allow returning it to the Azarah to fulfill the Mitzvah.)</p></div>
