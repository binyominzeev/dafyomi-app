<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one is Ma'aleh a salted dove's head that is (in all) a k'Zayis (without the salt it is less than a k'Zayis), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rava of Parzikiya):</span> R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish argue about this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> No, it is not clear how either of them would hold in Rava's case:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan said only that a bone can complete the Shi'ur, for it is the same Min (class) as meat. Perhaps salt (which is a different Min) does not complete the Shi'ur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish only said that a bone cannot complete the Shi'ur, for if it separated from the meat, there is no Mitzvah to offer it. Perhaps salt (which must be offered in any case) can complete the Shi'ur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Or, perhaps we do not distinguish, and the law of salt is like the law of meat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHY R. YOSI EXEMPTS FOR SOMETHING <i>PASUL</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> (If one slaughtered and was Ma'aleh b'Chutz, he is exempt for Ha'alah, for the Korban was Nifsal due to Shechutei Chutz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Chachamim):</span> Even if he slaughtered inside and was Ma'aleh outside, it was Nifsal once it left the Azarah, yet R. Yosi agrees that he is liable for both in this case!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (for R. Yosi ha'Galili - Rebbi):</span> The case of Shechitah inside and Ha'alah outside is different, for it had Sha'as ha'Kosher (to do Zerikah inside), but Shechutei Chutz did not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (for R. Yosi ha'Galili - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> The case of Shechitah inside and Ha'alah outside is different, for even after it left the Azarah, Im Alah Lo Yered (if it was brought up the ramp, we would offer it). This does not apply to Shechutei Chutz!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ze'iri):</span> They argue about (R. Yosi ha'Glili's opinion about Ha'alas Chutz of) Kodshim slaughtered at night. (Rebbi exempts, for it never had Sha'as ha'Kosher. R. Elazar is Mechayev, for (he holds like R. Shimon, who says that) Lo Yered.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> They argue about (Ha'alas Chutz) when the Kabalah was in a Chulin Kli. (Rebbi exempts, and R. Elazar is Mechayev, like above.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Tamei ate Kodesh, (whether it was Tahor or Tamei, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Galili exempts if he ate Tamei Kodesh, for he ate something Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Even a Tamei who ate Tahor Kodesh (normally) was Metamei it by touching it!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is a strong question. How can R. Yosi answer it?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> All agree that if the person became Tamei (Tum'as ha'Guf) before the Kodesh, he is Chayav Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim are Mechayev even when the Kodesh became Tamei first. Even though it was already forbidden to him (without Kares), when he later becomes Tamei, Migo (since) Tahor Kodesh becomes forbidden to him (with Kares), all Kodesh becomes forbidden to him with Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Galili exempts in this case. He argues with this application of Migo.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if R. Yosi argues with this application of Migo, he should agree that the Isur of Tum'as ha'Guf takes effect in addition to the exisiting Isur of Tum'as Basar, for Tum'as ha'Guf (is Kolel, i.e. forbids other things as well) and is more severe (has Kares!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Even though Tum'as ha'Guf has Kares, perhaps Tum'as Basar is more severe, for it has no Taharah (through a Mikvah or sprinkling Mei Chatas).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN <i>SHECHITAH</i> AND <i>HA'ALAH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In some ways Shechutei Chutz is more stringent than Ha'alas Chutz, and in some ways Ha'alah is more stringent;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shechitah is more stringent. One who slaughters (Kodshim b'Chutz) for the sake of a person (to eat) is liable, whereas one who offers to a person is exempt (Rashi - for Ha'alas Chutz, but he is liable for idolatry);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Ha'alah is more stringent. If two people held a knife and slaughtered (Kodshim b'Chutz) together, they are exempt, but if two were Ma'aleh together, they are liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon says, if someone was Ma'aleh several times, he is liable for each;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yosi says, he is liable only once. Also, he is liable only for offering on a Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Shimon says, even if he offered on a rock, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Presumably, Ha'alah for a person is exempt, because it says "la'Shem";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "la'Shem" also regarding Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We obligate Shechitah for a person, for it says "Ish Ish."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also regarding Ha'alah it says "Ish Ish"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches that if two were Ma'aleh together, they are liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>We should expound this similarly regarding Shechitah, to obligate two who held a knife and slaughtered together!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot say so, for it says "v'Nichras ha'Ish <i>ha'Hu</i>" - one who slaughtered, not two.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also regarding Ha'alah it says "ha'Hu"!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">108b----------------------------------------108b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That excludes one who was Shogeg, Anus or Mut'eh (deceived).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also regarding Shechitah, we should expound "ha'Hu" to exclude Shogeg, Ones and Mut'eh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Ha'alah two verses say "ha'Hu".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "la'Shem" exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach (Tosfos - after the lottery determined that it will not be a "Chatas la'Shem"; Rambam - after confessing on it, there is no longer a Mitzvah to bring it to Pesach Ohel Mo'ed).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ha'alah is more stringent...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Ish Ish"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This includes two who held a limb together and offered it (they are liable). A Kal va'Chomer would have exempted them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who slaughters for a person is liable, yet two who held a knife and slaughtered are exempt. One who offers to a person is exempt, all the more so two who offer together should be exempt!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Ish Ish" obligates them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yosi says, "ha'Hu" teaches that only one gets Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what do we learn from "Ish Ish"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Dibrah Torah bi'Leshon Bnei Adam (the Torah speaks like people do. Sometimes people repeat words needlessly. Therefore, we need not expound the extra occurrence.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Shimon expounds that "ha'Hu" to exclude Shogeg, Anus and Mut'eh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Yosi learns this additional law from the extra 'Hei' in "<i>ha</i>'Hu".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon does not expound the extra Hei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If R. Yosi does not expound this "Ish Ish" (because Dibrah Torah...), he should not expound "Ish Ish" regarding Shechitah either! What is his source to obligate for Shechitah for a person?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question 3:e):</span> "Dam Yechashev <i>la'Ish ha'Hu</i>" - even if the Shechitah was for a person.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If someone was Ma'aleh several times... (R. Shimon obligates for each, and R. Yosi obligates only once).</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All expound "La'asos <i>Oso</i>" - one is liable for a Shalem, but not for a Chaser;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R.

R. Shimon holds that it refers to a complete limb.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>All agree that he is liable only once for one limb (offered half at a time, or returned to the fire after it flew off. He is liable only for the last (Rashi; Tosfos - first) limb).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They argue about offering one limb:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon obligates for (Ha'alas Chutz of) Kodshim slaughtered inside that became Chaser (we return such limbs to the fire. This shows that Chaser limbs are still important. Surely, "La'asos Oso" exempts only for a Chaser limb of Shechutei Chutz);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi exempts for a Chaser limb, even if slaughtered inside (like R. Yishmael above).</p></div>
