<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p><i>ZEVACHIM</i> THAT BECAME MIXED UP WITH OTHERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If any Zevach became mixed with Chata'os ha'Mesos (Chata'os that cannot be offered; they must be left to die) or with Shor ha'Niskal (it was sentenced to be stoned), and we do not know which is which), even if one was mixed with 10,000, all must die;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If it became mixed with any of the following, all the animals are Ro'im (left to graze until they become blemished). They are sold, and a new Korban is brought with the highest amount of money received for any of them. The following animals forbid a mixture in this way.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An Aveirah was done with the animal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The owner or one witness testified that it killed a person, or it was Nirva or Rove'a (played the female or male part in bestiality);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>(Had there been two witnesses, it would be sentenced to die, and the law of Shor ha'Niskal (the first clause) would apply.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It was Muktzeh (designated for idolatry) or Ne'evad (served like idolatry);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>It was an Esnan (wages of a harlot), it was traded for a dog, it was Kilayim (a crossbreed), a Treifah or a Yotzei Dofen (an animal born through Caesarian section);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">71b----------------------------------------71b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If it became mixed with Tamim Chulin animals, we sell the Chulin (without knowing which they are) to people who need to buy the same kind of Zevach (e.g. Olah. Now all the mixed animals are Olos. The law is like in the coming clause.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If Kodshim became mixed with Kodshim, the following applies.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If all are the same Zevach, each is offered l'Shem its owner (Tosfos - Stam is l'Shem Ba'alim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they are different Zevachim, they are Ro'im, and (after they become blemished) we redeem them onto money;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>New Korbanos are bought. For each we spend the highest value of an animal of the mixture. The owner suffers the loss.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If they became mixed with Bechor or Ma'aser (which are not redeemed), they are Ro'im. All are eaten like Bechor or Ma'aser (i.e. they may not be sold in the market or by weight).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>It is possible for any two kinds of Zevachim to become mixed together, except for Chatas and Asham. (Asham is always a male sheep. This cannot be a Chatas.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHY TWO <i>MISHNAYOS</i> OF MIXTURES ARE NEEDED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does it say '<i>Even</i> if one (Korban) was mixed with 10,000 (animals that must die)'? This is a smaller Chidush. We merely follow the majority!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, even if one animal that must die was mixed with 10,000 Korbanos (all must die. Tosfos - similarly, the next clauses also discuss one Pasul animal mixed with a majority of Korbanos)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another Mishnah teaches this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> If an animal was Pasul for a Korban, e.g. a Nirva or Rove'a, and it became mixed with any number of animals, all are Pesulim for Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sima):</span> We need both Mishnayos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we had only Mishnah #1, one might have thought that the mixture is Pasul for Korbanos, but one may benefit from it (even when one may not benefit from some of the animals);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we had only our Mishnah, one might have thought that only Isurei ha'Na'ah (animals forbidden to benefit from them) forbid a mixture, but not other Pesulim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also our Mishnah teaches cases that are not Isurei ha'Na'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It does not teach that one of them forbids a mixture of any size.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It would have sufficed to teach (Isurei ha'Na'ah in) Mishnah #1! (Why were they repeated in our Mishnah?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah teaches what can be done with the mixture.</p></div>
