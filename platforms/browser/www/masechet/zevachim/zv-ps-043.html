<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THINGS EXEMPT FROM <i>PIGUL</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Pigul does not apply to the following (in most cases, because they do not have Matirim):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Kometz, Ketores, frankincense, a (voluntary) Minchah of a Kohen, Minchas Chavitin (the daily Minchah of a Kohen Gadol), blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir adds Nesachim brought without a Korban;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim add all Nesachim, even if brought with a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon says, Pigul does not apply to the Log of oil that a Metzora brings;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Meir says, it does apply, because the blood of the Asham permits it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Pigul applies to anything that has Matirim that permit it to people or to (be offered on) the Mizbe'ach:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It applies to an Olah, for the blood permits the limbs to the Mizbe'ach and the skin to Kohanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The blood of Olas ha'Of permits the meat to the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The blood of Chatas ha'Of permits the meat to Kohanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The blood of Parim or Se'irim ha'Nisrafim permits the Eimurim to the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Shimon says, Pigul applies only to things offered on the outer Mizbe'ach like Shelamim (the source from which we learn Pigul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Ula):</span> If a Pigul Kometz was thrown on the Mizbe'ach, it loses the status of Pigul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it causes something else (the rest of the Minchah) to become Pigul, all the more so it itself! (This will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Ula mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the Kometz itself was not acceptable, it could not cause the rest of the Minchah to become Pigul. (Pigul does not apply unless all the Matirim were offered properly, aside from intent Chutz li'Zmano.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his Chidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One (who eats it) is not liable for Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Our Mishnah explicitly teaches that Pigul does not apply to a Kometz!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If it was brought up the ramp, we do not bring it down.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Mishnah explicitly teaches this!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If any of the following was brought up the ramp, we do not bring it down - something (e.g. blood or Eimurim) that was Lan (was left overnight), Yotzei (left the Mikdash), Tamei, something slaughtered with intent Chutz li'Zmano or Chutz li'Mkomo, or was not offered the day the animal was slaughtered).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) Answer:</span> If it was taken down (from the Mizbe'ach), we bring it up again.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A Mishnah teaches otherwise!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Just like if it was brought up, we do not bring it down, if it was taken down, we do not bring it up.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it caught fire on the Mizbe'ach (before it fell off).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Shitah Mekubetzes) Answer #1:</span> If it was taken down, we do not bring it up.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A Mishnah explicitly teaches this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Just like if it was brought up, we do not bring it down, if it was taken down, we do not bring it up.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Ula teaches that if it caught fire on the Mizbe'ach, we bring it up again. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ula already taught this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> The Mishnah (that teaches that we do not bring it up again) applies when it had not caught fire. If it caught fire, we bring it up again.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that that applies only to a limb (i.e. of an Olah), for it is all one entity, and it is as if all of it caught fire, but a Kometz is not all one entity, so the part that did not catch fire is not brought up again;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">43b----------------------------------------43b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, Ula needed to teach also about a Kometz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Achai):</span> We learn from Ula that if half of a Pigul Kometz was put on the Mizbe'ach and caught fire, even the half on the ground ceases to be Pigul, and we bring it up.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ISURIM THAT BECOME PERMITTED THROUGH THE <i>MIZBE'ACH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> If Pigul, Nosar or Tamei was brought up on the Mizbe'ach, the Isur goes away.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> Does the Mizbe'ach permit Isurim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> The case is, it caught fire.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak bar Bisna - Beraisa - Acherim):</span> (Eating Kodshim b'Tum'ah is punishable by Kares. The Torah does not say explicitly if this is for Tum'as ha'Guf (the person is Tamei) or for Tum'as Basar.) "V'Tum'aso (his or its Tum'ah) Alav" refers to one (i.e. a person) whose Tum'ah can cease (through immersion). It does not refer to Tamei meat, for its Tum'ah never goes away.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to R. Yitzchak, meat can become Tahor!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> The Tana means that Tum'as Basar never goes away through immersion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The verse does not mention immersion. The Tana says that the Tum'ah cannot cease through any means!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> The verse discusses meat of Shelamim, which is not offered on the Mizbe'ach. (It can never become Tahor.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> "V'Tum'aso Alav" refers to one (i.e. a person) whose Tum'ah can cease while he is intact. It does not refer to meat, for its Tum'ah does not cease until some of it is missing (burned).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Tum'aso Alav" refers to a Tum'as ha'Guf;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to Tamei meat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It says here "Tum'aso", like it says ("Od Tum'aso Bo") regarding Tum'as Mes;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like there it refers to Tum'as ha'Guf, also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosi):</span> Here (regarding eating Kodshim b'Tum'ah) it refers to Kodshim in the plural (Shelamim). Since "Tum'aso" is singular, it refers to Tum'as ha'Guf.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rebbi):</span> "V'Achal" refers to Tum'as ha'Guf (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Meir):</span> "V'Tum'aso Alav" refers to one whose Tum'ah can cease, but not to meat, for its Tum'ah never goes away.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rebbi learn from "v'Achal" that it refers to Tum'as ha'Guf?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> (Just before "v'Tum'aso Alav" (Vayikra 7:20), the Torah permitted a Tahor to eat Kodshim. The only reason to think that "v'Tum'aso Alav" refers to Tum'as Basar is the gender. Tum'aso is masculine, and the verse discusses a <i>Nefesh</i> (feminine) who eats. Therefore,) the next verse ("V'Nefesh...", which also discusses eating Kodshim b'Tum'ah) begins and ends in the feminine, and uses the masculine ("v'Achal") in the middle, to teach that the Torah is not particular about the gender.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> No one can explain verses as R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi does, and no one can explain Beraisos as Ze'iri does!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>EATING <i>MA'ASER</i> AND <i>TERUMAH</i> WHILE <i>TAMEI</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> Why must the Torah teach about lenient and severe (transgressions)? (Ze'iri will explain everything later.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it taught only lenient ones, one might have thought that one transgresses a Lav for lenient ones and is Chayav Misah (bi'Dei Shamayim) for severe ones;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only severe ones, one might have thought that one is liable for severe ones and is exempt for lenient ones;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do lenient and severe ones refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Lenient refers to eating Ma'aser (b'Tum'as ha'Guf). Severe ones refers to eating Terumah (b'Tum'as ha'Guf).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> The Beraisa says, 'one <i>might have thought that</i>... one is Chayav Misah for severe ones.' This is true regarding Terumah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> It says, 'One might have thought that lenient ones are Chayavei Lavin, and severe ones are Chayavei Misah';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One could not learn Chiyuv Misah from (a Kal va'Chomer from lenient ones, which are) Chayavei Lavin due to Dayo (a Kal va'Chomer can teach that the same law applies elsewhere, but it cannot teach more than the law of the source! Indeed, this refutes the simple understanding of the Beraisa itself, no matter which transgressions it refers to!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Lenient refers to a (person who became) Tamei (by touching a) Sheretz who eats (something, to be explained), severe refers to a Tamei Mes who eats.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> No matter what they eat, it does not fit the Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they ate Terumah, both are Chayav Misah. The Beraisa implies that even the severe one is not Chayav Misah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they ate Ma'aser, why would one think (to learn from lenient ones) that severe ones are Chayavei Misah? Due to Dayo, we cannot learn more than the law of lenient ones, i.e. a Lav!</p></div>
