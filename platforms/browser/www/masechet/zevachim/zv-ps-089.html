<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THAT WHICH IS MORE FREQUENT TAKES PRECEDENCE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Whatever is more Tadir (frequent) takes precedence (is done first):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Temidim come before Musafim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Musafim of Shabbos come before Musafim of Rosh Chodesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Musafim of Rosh Chodesh come before Musafim of Rosh Hashanah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>We learn from "Milvad Olas ha'Boker Asher l'Olas ha'Tamid Ta'asu Es Eleh" (i.e. the Tamid is first, because it is more Tadir).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Mishnah explicitly gave the source - "Milvad Olas..."!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps only the Tamid has precedence, for it is brought every day. What is the source that a more frequent Musaf precedes a less frequent Musaf?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ila'a):</span> "<i>Ka'Eleh</i> Ta'asu la'Yom Shiv'as Yamim" - the Musafim (of Pesach) are like the Tamid (mentioned before this), i.e. what is more Tadir comes first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse is needed for the simple meaning! (It is not extra to teach about Tadir.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said '<i>Eleh</i> Ta'asu la'Yom'. (Rather, it says "ka'Eleh", to equate it to the Tamid.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Had it said this, one might have thought that the seven lambs are brought over the course of the seven days!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "la'Yom" (to teach that all the Korbanos are brought each day).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One might have thought that the Korbanos are brought on the first day, and we would not know what is brought on the other days!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ta'asu" teaches that all the Asiyos (actions) are the same.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> We learn from "Milvad Olas...";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it said only "Milvad Olas ha'Boker", we would have known that the Tamid is first;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Asher l'Olas ha'Tamid" is extra, to teach that whatever is more Tadir has precedence.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THAT WHICH IS MORE <i>KADOSH</i> TAKES PRECEDENCE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Whatever is more Kadosh comes first:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Dam Chatas comes before Dam Olah, for the former is Mechaper (for Chayavei Kerisus);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Ivrei (limbs of an) Olah come before Eimurei (the parts offered, e.g. Chelev of a) Chatas, for Olah is Kalil (entirely burned on the Mizbe'ach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chatas comes before Asham, for its blood is put on the four Keranos (and Dam Asham is not) and on the Yesod (Rashi - and this is not explicit in the Torah regarding Asham; Shitah Mekubetzes - Dam Chatas goes on the Yesod just like Dam Asham, i.e. this is not a stringency of Asham over Chatas);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Asham comes before Todah and Eil Nazir, for it is Kodshei Kodoshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Todah and Eil Nazir come before Shelamim, for they are eaten only for one day (and a night) and are accompanied by bread;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Shelamim comes before Bechor, for it requires Zerikah on (two edges, and the blood goes on) all four walls, Semichah, Nesachim, and Tenufah (waving) of Chazeh v'Shok (the chest and thigh);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>Bechor comes before Ma'aser (Behemah), for it is Kodesh from (the time it was in or left) the womb, and only Kohanim eat it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>Ma'aser comes before birds, for it is a Zevach (slaughtered, as opposed to Melikah), and parts of it, i.e. the blood and Eimurim, are Kodshei Kodoshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>Birds come before Menachos, for they have blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p>Minchas Chotei (i.e. that a very poor person brings for a Chatas Oleh v'Yored) comes before Minchas Nedavah, for it is brought due to a transgression;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p>Chatas ha'Of comes before Olas ha'Of;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p>The same applies to making them Hekdesh. (One should be Makdish Chatas ha'Of before Olas ha'Of.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Question:</span> Why does it say "u'Far Sheni... l'Chatas"? We already know that two bulls are taken (for Chanukas ha'Leviyim) - "va'Aseh Es ha'Echad Chatas v'Es ha'Echad Olah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Chatas is offered entirely before the Olah. The verse calls it second, to teach that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since the verse calls it second, perhaps the Olah is offered entirely before the Chatas!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Va'Aseh Es ha'Echad Chatas v'Es ha'Echad Olah."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Dam Chatas comes before Dam Olah, for it is (normally) Mechaper, (but Ivrei Olah come before Eimurei Chatas).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ivrei Olah...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Matanah of Dam Chatas is fully Mechaper, but the last three Matanos are not. Why do they come before Dam Olah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> The verse teaches that Dam Chatas ha'Leviyim comes before Dam Olah, even though this Chatas did not atone for a Chet, so it was like an Olah. This teaches that the Torah gives precedence to Matanos Dam Chatas even when it does not atone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> Once a Kohen begins Matanos Dam Chatas, he finishes them (before engaging in another Korban).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, it should have said that Dam Asham comes before Dam Olah. Since the Seifa teaches that Ivrei Olah come before Eimurei Chatas, the Reisha discusses Dam Chatas for parallel structure;</p></div>
