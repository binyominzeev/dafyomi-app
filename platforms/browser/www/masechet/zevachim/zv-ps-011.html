<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> If the blood of any Korban was brought inside the Heichal (except of an inner Chatas) to atone, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, only blood of a Chatas is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, also blood of an Asham - "ka'Chatas ka'Asham".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim argue with R. Eliezer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They learn from a Kal va'Chomer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An Olah is entirely burned on the Mizbeach, yet if its blood enters the Heichal it is Kosher. An Asham is not entirely burned, all the more so it remains Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> An Olah does not atone. We cannot learn to an Asham, which atones!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Minchas Chotei (a very poor person brings in place of an animal for certain Aveiros) proves that this is not a problem. It atones, yet if it enters the Heichal it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't we use Chatas ha'Of to prove that even blood of something that atones can remain Kosher when brought into the Heichal?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Avin asked if the blood of Chatas ha'Of is Pasul if it enters the Heichal (and his question was not resolved).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Minchas Chotei, for it is not a Zevach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah of Olah and Minchas Chotei. Both are Kodshei Kodoshim, and if their blood enters the Heichal it remains Kosher. The same applies to Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava of Barnish):</span> We cannot learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah, for there is no minimal price of an Olah or Minchas Chotei, but Asham has a minimum price! (Four kinds of Asham must be bought for at least two Sela'im. We could not learn to them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Chachamim learn from "Damah". Its (a Chatas') blood is Pasul if it enters the Heichal, but not blood of any other Korban;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer expounds, if its <i>blood</i> enters the Heichal it is Pasul, if the meat enters, it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim learn that from 'Dam'. The extra 'Hei' in "Dam<i>ah</i> (<i>its</i> blood)" excludes that of other Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Eliezer does not expound the 'Hei'.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE HEKESH OF MENACHOS TO CHATAS AND ASHAM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>According to Chachamim (who say that Asham Lo Lishmah is Kosher), we understand why Minchah is equated to Chatas and Asham;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> "Kodesh Kodoshim Hi ka'Chatas vecha'Asham" - Minchas Chotei is like Chatas. If the Kometz (the handful taken from a Minchah and burned on the Mizbeach) was taken Lo Lishmah, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Minchas Nedavah is like Asham. If the Kometz was taken Lo Lishmah, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Eliezer, Chatas and Asham are both Pasul Lo Lishmah. Why must the Torah equate Menachos to both of them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches another law of R. Shimon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Kometz was taken not in a Keli Shares, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah brei d'R. Chiya):</span> R. Eliezer learns from "Kodesh Kodoshim Hi ka'Chatas vecha'Asham." (In Kemitzah, a Kohen folds his middle three fingers onto the palm to take from a Minchah the part (called the Kometz) that will be burned on the Mizbe'ach.) If the Kohen wants to take the Kometz to the Mizbe'ach in his hand, he must use his right hand, the hand he uses to throw the blood of Chatas;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If the Kohen wants to to take the Kometz to the Mizbe'ach in a Keli Shares, he may take it and throw it with his left hand, for he may use the left hand to carry and throw blood of an Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon himself expounded this verse to teach the difference between Minchas Chotei and Minchas Nedavah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he uses the verse to teach about taking the Kometz with and without a Keli;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He learns that Minchas Chotei Lo Lishmah is Pasul from a different verse (Vayikra 5:11) that says "Hi", just like we expounded about Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Chachamim who argue with R. Shimon, why does the Torah equate Chatas and Asham?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Asham requires Semichah, just like Chatas.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Yosi ben Choni):</span> (Any Zevach that was slaughtered l'Shem Pesach or Chatas is Pasul.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Eliezer agrees with Yosi ben Choni.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> (Tosfos - R. Yochanan means that he agrees about Zevachim l'Shem Pesach, but) he argues about Zevachim l'Shem Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If a Pesach more than one year old was slaughtered Lishmah at the proper time (to slaughter Pesach, i.e. the afternoon of Erev Pesach), or if other Zevachim were slaughtered l'Shem Pesach at this time, they are Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, they are Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Any other day, Pesach Lishmo (l'Shem Pesach) is Pasul, yet other Zevachim l'Shem Pesach are Kosher. On Erev Pesach, when Pesach Lishmo is Kosher, all the more so other Zevachim l'Shem Pesach are Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> (If you learn such a Kal va'Chomer,) perhaps you should say just the contrary! Any other day, Pesach Lishmo is Pasul, yet Pesach l'Shem another Zevach is Kosher. On Erev Pesach, when Pesach Lishmo is Kosher, all the more so it should be Kosher l'Shem another Zevach (but we know that this is wrong)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like you do not learn this Kal va'Chomer, you should not learn yours!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Also, there is a difficulty with your Kal va'Chomer. Other Korbanos are Kosher l'Shem Pesach on other days, because Pesach l'Shem other Korbanos is Kosher then. We cannot say that other Zevachim l'Shem Pesach are Kosher on Erev Pesach, when Pesach l'Shem other Korbanos is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> If you say like this, Shelamim Lo Lishmah is Pasul more than Pesach! (I.e. if Shelamim is slaughtered l'Shem Pesach at the time for Pesach, it is Pasul, but Pesach l'Shem Shelamim at the time of Shelamim (i.e. every day except Erev Pesach) is Kosher. This is unreasonable, for a verse disqualifies Pesach Lo Lishmah, but there is no such verse for Shelamim!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> I learn from a different Kal va'Chomer. Mosar Pesach becomes a Shelamim, but Mosar Shelamim is not a Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though Mosar Pesach is a Shelamim, if Pesach is slaughtered l'Shem Shelamim at its (Pesach's) proper time it is Pasul. Mosar Shelamim is not a Pesach, all the more so if Shelamim is slaughtered l'Shem Pesach at this time it is Pasul! (R. Tam - Rabah and R. Yochanan learned from here that R. Eliezer admits about Zevachim l'Shem Pesach. We see below that R. Eliezer argues about Zevachim l'Shem Chatas. Rashi - Rabah holds like this, but R. Yochanan holds that the same reasoning to disqualify l'Shem Pesach disqualifies l'Shem Chatas. R. Eliezer says differently about l'Shem Chatas below, i.e. to refute R. Yehoshua according to R. Yehoshua's reasoning.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Shimon Achi Azaryah):</span> (Any Zevach that was slaughtered l'Shem a Korban of higher Kedushah is Kosher. A Zevach slaughtered l'Shem a Korban of lower Kedushah is Pasul.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Shimon learns from "v'Lo Yechalelu Es Kodshei Bnei Yisrael Es Asher <i>Yarimu</i>" - Shechitah l'Shem a Korban of higher Kedushah does not disqualify, but Shechitah l'Shem a lower Kedushah disqualifies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse is needed to teach Shmuel's law!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One who eats Tevel (untithed produce) is Chayav Misah (b'Yedei Shamayim). "V'Lo Yechalelu Es Kodshei... Asher <i>Yarimu</i>" refers to something from which Terumah <i>will</i> be taken, i.e. Tevel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it came to teach only the first law, it would have said '...Asher Hurmu';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The future tense 'Yarimu' teaches also Shmuel's law. (Shitah - if it came to teach only Shmuel's law, it would not say "Es Kodshei Bnei Yisrael.")</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R.

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Or, does he hold that he was Yotzei (and they argue in both cases)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye - Seifa):</span> If a Bechor or Ma'aser was slaughtered l'Shem Shelamim, it is Kosher. If a Shelamim was slaughtered l'Shem Bechor or Ma'aser, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>'Kosher' cannot mean that he was Yotzei. This does not apply to Bechor and Ma'aser!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, it must mean that it is Kosher, and he was not Yotzei. Surely, 'Kosher' means this also in the Reisha!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. In the Seifa it means that he was not Yotzei, but in the Reisha it means that he was Yotzei!</p></div>
