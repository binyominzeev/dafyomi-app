<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Huna):</span> We never find something that is Pasul Lishmah and Kosher Lo Lishmah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do find this! Pesach on any day other than Erev Pesach is Pasul Lishmah and Kosher Lo Lishmah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Pesach on any other day is a Shelamim. Lo l'Shem Pesach is not (Tosfos - purely) Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Beraisa supports Rav Chilkiyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Shechutei Chutz does not apply to the following (because they are not fit for Pesach Ohel Mo'ed); an Olah that is Mechusar Zeman, the Asham of a (Tamei) Nazir or Metzora! (Below we explain the Pesul of the Ashamos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (The verse of Shechutei Chutz did not need to list the three species Kosher for Korbanos.) Each is extra to teach one of these - "Shor, Chesev, Ez."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Tana omitted Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of the Ashamos?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If they are offered (Lishmah) in the proper time, Shechutei Chutz applies even to Chatas!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we must say that they are Mechusar Zeman.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Were they Lishmah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If they were, why is he liable for them?! (It is Kosher only if he was Oker through slaughtering l'Shem a different Korban.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that they were Lo Lishmah. (This is a proof for Rav Chilkiyah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, they were offered in the proper time, Lo Lishmah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana is R. Eliezer, who says that also Asham Lo Lishmah is Pasul. (Nevertheless, he is liable, for if slaughtered Stam in the Mikdash, it would be Lishmah and Kosher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He taught Asham, which we learned (that it is Pasul Lo Lishmah) from Chatas, and the same applies to Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Question (against Rav Huna (and support for Rav Chilkiyah) - Beraisa) Suggestion: Perhaps one is liable for Shechutei Chutz for an Olah which is (itself) Mechusar Zeman or a Chatas that it or its owner is Mechusar Zeman!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'El Pesach Ohel Mo'ed Lo Hevi'o" - Shechutei Chutz applies only to things proper to be offered Pesach Ohel Mo'ed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Tana excludes Asham.</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the Korbanos are Lishmah, even for Asham he should be exempt!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we must say that they are Lo Lishmah. (The Tana excludes Asham, for he would be liable for it. This supports Rav Chilkiyah and refutes Rav Huna!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, they are Lo Lishmah, but one may not infer that he would be liable for Asham;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana is R. Eliezer, who disqualifies Asham Lo Lishmah. He taught Chatas, the source, and the same applies to Asham, which we learned from Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Version #1 (Rashi) Question (against Rav Huna, and support for Rav Chilkiyah - Rav Dimi - Tana d'Vei R. Livai's Beraisa (#1)) Suggestion: Perhaps one is exempt for Shechutei Chutz for an Olah if its owner is Mechusar Zeman, and for Asham Metzora or Asham Nazir...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(The Tana omitted Chatas. We deduce like above that the Ashamos were Mechusar Zeman and Lo Lishmah, and he is liable!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the Tana expound that he is liable?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Shitah Mekubetzes, including bracketed text):</span> The following refutes Rav Huna and supports Rav Chilkiyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Rav Dimi citing Beraisa #1 - the above Beraisa) Suggestion: Perhaps one is exempt for Shechutei Chutz for an Olah if its owner is Mechusar Zeman, and for Asham Metzora or Asham Nazir...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> The Tana expounded that one is liable. I do not understand! (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The verse did not need to list the three species. "Shor, Kesev, Ez" are extra, to teach that one is liable in these three cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already asked this (b) and answered it (c) above! (The Beraisa is like R. Eliezer. The Shechitah was Lo Lishmah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Rav Dimi posed a contradiction, therefore, we cannot give the above answer;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (with Beraisa #1 - Rav Dimi - Levi's Beraisa (#2)):</span> If Asham Nazir or Asham Metzora was slaughtered Lo Lishmah, it is Kosher, but the owner was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If the owner was Mechusar Zeman, or the animals were two years old (a first year animal is required), they are Pesulim (and one who slaughters them outside is exempt).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> Beraisa #1 is Mechayev for Shechitah Lo Lishmah, and Beraisa #2 exempts for Shechitah Lishmah. (Since he answered the contradiction, this shows that he holds that also Beraisa #1 discusses Mechusar Zeman.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Rav Ashi asked a similar contradiction between our Mishnah (which exempts for Shechutei Chutz of Asham Mechusar Zeman) and the Beraisa (above (b:1), which is Mechayev);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He answered that the Mishnah exempts when it was Lishmah (for it is Pasul), and the Beraisa is Mechayev for Lo Lishmah (it is Kosher).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> This refutes Rav Huna, for he cannot answer like above!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #1 is Mechayev when two Ashamos were separated for Acharayus (in case one will become lost or Pasul, the other will be offered. Since we cannot offer both for Ashamos), from the beginning, it is as if one of them is an Olah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">115b----------------------------------------115b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>This is like Rav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If an Asham was Nitak to graze, and it was slaughtered Stam, it is a Kosher Olah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THINGS <i>PASUL</i> FOR <i>HAKTARAH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one offers (is Maktir) meat of a Chatas (outside, he is exempt...)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source to exempt for offering any of the following outside?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Meat of a Chatas, Asham, (other) Kodshei Kodoshim, Kodshim Kalim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The remains of the Omer or of a Minchah (after Kemitzah), Shtei ha'Lechem, Lechem ha'Panim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is liable for something like "Olah", i.e. it is proper to be offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to exempt for the following Avodos outside?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Pouring oil (on a Minchah), breaking a Minchah into pieces, mixing (the flour with oil), salting, Tenufah, Hagashah, arranging the Lechem ha'Panim on the Shulchan, Dishun ha'Menorah, Kemitzah, and Kabalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Asher Ya'aleh Olah Oh Zevach" - one is liable only for something resembling Ha'alah (Haktarah), i.e. a final Avodah (there is no Avodah after it).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p><i>AVODAH</i> BEFORE THE <i>MISHKAN</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Before the Mishkan was erected... (firstborns did the Avodah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Rav Ketina citing R. Asi):</span> "Vayishlach Es Na'arei Bnei Yisrael" (before Matan Torah) was the last time firstborns did the Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The Olah that Bnei Yisrael offered in the Midbar did require Hefshet and Nitu'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When Rav Chisda heard the first teaching of Rav Huna, he intended to challenge it from our Mishnah. After he heard the second teaching, he rather challenged both teachings from a Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against both teachings - Rav Chisda - Beraisa):</span> Before the Mishkan was erected, Bamos were permitted, firstborns did the Avodah, and anything could be offered on a Bamah, i.e. a Behemah, Chayah, Of, male or female, Tam or Ba'al Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Only Tahor species could be offered, but not Teme'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>All the Korbanos were Olos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Olah that Bnei Yisrael offered in the Midbar did not require Hefshet and Nitu'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Nowadays, Nochrim may do so (offer anything on a Bamah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (for the first teaching):</span> Tana'im argue about this. Rav Huna holds like Rebbi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> "V'Gam ha'Kohanim ha'Nigashim El Hash-m Yiskadashu" warns the firstborns (they are the 'Kohanim' who come close for Avodah) to stay far from Har Sinai;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi says, it warns Nadav and Avihu (for only Bnei Aharon will do Avodah from now on).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rebbi, we understand "Hu Asher Diber Hash-m bi'Krovai Akadesh" - the end of the above verse ("Pen Yifrotz Bahem") foreshadowed the death of Nadav and Avihu (when they entered the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, according to R. Yehoshua ben Korchah, where had Hash-m alluded to the death of Nadav and Avihu? ("Pen Yifrotz Bahem" discusses the firstborns!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We read "v'No'adti Shamah li'Vnei Yisrael v'Nikdash <i>bi'Chvodi</i>" like 'bi'Chvudai' (through my honored ones);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Hash-m told this to Moshe on Sinai. Moshe did not know to whom He referred to until they died. Then, Moshe told Aharon that they were killed (Maharsha - for a minute transgression) in order to be Mekadesh Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Aharon realized that their death signified their awesome greatness. He was silent, and was rewarded - "Dom la'Shem v'Hischolel Lo";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We can also learn from "Es Lachashos v'Es Ledaber" - sometimes one is rewarded for silence, and sometimes one is rewarded for speaking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> We read "Nora Elokim mi'Mikdashecha" like 'mi'Mekudashecha (from Your holy ones).' When Hash-m punishes Tzadikim (for minute transgressions), He is feared, exalted and praised.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We did not defend Rav Huna's teaching about Hefshet and Nitu'ach of the Olah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue also about this. He holds like Tana d'vei R. Yishmael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Hash-m taught to Moshe the essence of the Mitzvos on Sinai. He taught to him the details (during the 40 years in the Midbar) in the Ohel Mo'ed. (Hefshet and Nitu'ach are details. They were taught in the Mishkan. They did not apply before this, e.g. to the Olah of Sinai.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva says, the essence and the details were given on Sinai. They were repeated in the Ohel Mo'ed, and again in Arvos Mo'av (Sefer Devarim, in the 40th year in the Midbar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> "Va'Yikach (No'ach) mi'Kol Behemah ha'Tehorah umi'Kol Of ha'Tahor" - Behemah (and Of) are understood simply, and Chayos are included in "Behemah";</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>He offered males and females, Tam and blemished animals; but not animals missing a limb.</p></div>
