<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Dimi citing Ilfa):</span> According to R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon, Linah does not apply to Kidush. Does Linah disqualify water in the Kiyor (from being used for Kidush)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like Linah does not invalidate Kidush, it does not disqualify water for Kidush;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since the Kiyor is Mekadesh the water, Linah applies?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> Ilfa later answered his question. The Tana'im argue about whether Linah disqualifies Kidush and whether it disqualifies the water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (against Ravin - R. Yitzchak bar Bisna):</span> Rav Asi cited Ilfa to say that if water was left in the Kiyor when night came, it may be used to be Mekadesh at night. One does not Mekadesh in the morning;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this mean that one need not be Mekadesh in the morning, or that (Linah disqualified, so) it may not be used in the morning (according to R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon. According to Rebbi, surely he must be Mekadesh in the morning, and the water is Pasul!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak bar Bisna:</span> We were unable to answer this question. According to you (Ravin), surely it means that he need not be Mekadesh in the morning!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (against Ravin - Beraisa #1):</span> Ben Katin made 12 faucets for the Kiyor, and a pulley (to enable returning the water to the pit every night, lest it become Pasul, and drawing it again the next morning).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Beraisa is R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon (and it says that Linah disqualifies water in the Kiyor)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Beraisa is Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Reisha is R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon, presumably entire Beraisa is like R. Elazar!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reisha):</span> The Kohen Gadol (on Yom Kipur) came to his bull (to confess before slaughtering it). it was between the Ulam and the Mizbeach. The back faced the north, and its head was turned towards the west. The Kohen was east of it, and facing west.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon is the Tana who considers between the Ulam and the Mizbeach to be in the north half of the Azarah (so Kodshei Kodoshim may be slaughtered there)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> From the north wall of the Mizbeach until the north wall of the Azarah, even with (i.e. not east or west of) the Mizbeach is considered the north half of the Azarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon adds (the north half of the Azarah that is) even with the area between the Ulam and the Mizbeach;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Rebbi adds even (the north half that is) east of the Mizbeach;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>All exclude what is even with the Beis ha'Chalifos (chambers in the Ulam) or to its west (because the Mizbeach cannot be seen from there).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely we can say that Rebbi is the Tana of Beraisa #1!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi allows Shechitah in the east part of the Azarah (where Zarim often go), all the more so he allows between the Ulam and the Mizbeach (which is more Kadosh)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Since Rebbi allows Shechitah in the east, he would not say that the bull should be so close to the Ulam!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Also if the Tana is R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon, the bull could have been further from the Ulam, i.e. even with the Mizbeach on the north side!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say, the bull was close to the Ulam to reduce fatigue of the Kohen Gadol (who must take its blood into the Ulam).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Likewise, Rebbi can be the Tana. The bull is near the Ulam to reduce fatigue!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN IS <i>KIDUSH</i> DISQUALIFIED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a Kohen was Mekadesh to do Terumas ha'Deshen (taking ashes off the Mizbe'ach), he need not be Mekadesh again after dawn, because Terumas ha'Deshen is the beginning of the Avodah of the coming day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not like Rebbi. He requires a new Kidush after dawn!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is not like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon. He holds that a new day never requires a new Kidush! (Even if Terumas ha'Deshen were considered Avodah of the previous day, no new Kodesh would be needed!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Really, it is like Rebbi. He says that Linah disqualifies Kidush only mid'Rabanan;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>From Krias ha'Gever (when the rooster (alternatively, a certain man) cries out, shortly before dawn; this is the normal time for Terumas ha'Deshen) and onwards, it appears like the coming day, so Chachamim did not decree that Linah disqualifies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Really, it is like R. Elazar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan rules like R. Elazar regarding beginning the coming day's Avodah (that one Kidush suffices for all Avodos, even after dawn), and like Rebbi regarding the previous day's Avodah (that a new Kidush is needed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> When the other Kohanim saw (the Kohen doing Terumas ha'Deshen) descend, they ran to be Mekadesh.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We understand according to Abaye, who establishes R. Yochanan like Rebbi. He admits that a new Kidush is not needed after Krias ha'Gever. The Mishnah is like Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to Rava, R. Yochanan is like R. Elazar, but Rebbi requires a new Kidush after Krias a'Gever. Who taught the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rebbi says that the Kidush does not help for after dawn. R. Elazar says that last night's Kidush is still valid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is like R. Elazar. The case is, the Kohanim were not doing Avodah from the night before.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DOES LEAVING THE <i>AZARAH</i> DISQUALIFY THE <i>KIDUSH</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does leaving the Azarah disqualify the Kidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If you will say that Linah does not disqualify, perhaps leaving does, because he stopped thinking about the Avodah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps he does not stop thinking about it, because he can return to serve!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> If he was Mekadesh and his hands later became Teme'im, he immerses them. He need not be Mekadesh again. If they left the Azarah, he need not be Mekadesh again.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We knew that if the hands left the Azarah, he need not Mekadesh again;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The question is when <i>he</i> left the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> Kidush must be from a Keli Shares in the Azarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he was Mekadesh from a Keli Shares outside the Azarah, or from a Chulin Keli in the Azarah, or if he immersed his hands in water in a cave, he is Mechalel Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Kidush from a Keli Shares outside is Pasul, but if he was Mekadesh inside and left, it is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, perhaps he was inside, and he was Mekadesh from a Keli Shares outside (so the above inference is invalid), and we cannot settle our question.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Zvid - Beraisa):</span> If he intended to leave the Azarah for a while, he must immerse. If he left for a short time, he must be Mekadesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> 'To leave for a while' means to excrete. 'For a short time' means to urinate.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Mishnah explicitly teaches that!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who excretes must immerse. One who urinates must be Mekadesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa explains what the Mishnah said briefly.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Chiya b'Rebbi Yosef):</span> Those who will engage in the Parah Adumah are Mekadesh in a Keli Shares in the Mikdash, then go outside. (This proves that going outside does not disqualify Kidush.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They may be Mekadesh outside, even in a Chulin Keli, even of earthenware.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> The Parah Adumah is different. Since its Avodah is done outside, going outside does not disqualify Kidush.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is not like Avodas Panim (i.e. in the Azarah), why is Kidush needed at all?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must resemble Avodas Panim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>DOES <i>TUM'AH</i> DISQUALIFY THE <i>KIDUSH</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Tum'ah disqualify Kidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If you will say that leaving does not disqualify Kidush, perhaps that is because the Kohen can still serve, but if he became Tamei, he cannot, so he stopped thinking about Avodah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since he will become Tahor and Kosher to serve again, he continues thinking about Avodah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> If he was Mekadesh and his hands later became Teme'im, he immerses them. He need not be Mekadesh again.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The question was not when only his hands became Teme'im, rather, when <i>he</i> became Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If he became Tamei, he cannot serve (even after immersing) until nightfall, so he stops thinking about Avodah! (Surely he must be Mekadesh again!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We ask about one who became Tamei just before sundown.</p></div>
