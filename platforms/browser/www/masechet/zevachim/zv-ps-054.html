<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WAS THERE A <i>YESOD</i> IN THE SOUTH AND EAST?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The Kohen was Molek Olas ha'Of (on the Sovev, in the southeast corner) opposite the Oref. He would fully cut both Simanim. He pressed the bird against the Mizbe'ach to squeeze out the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Will we say that Melikah was done in the air?! (Rashi - i.e., above the bare floor. We know that even if he bends down to do Melikah below his feet, i.e. below the Sovev, it is Kosher. If there was no Yesod there, the blood would fall to the floor! R. Tam - is Melikah Kosher in the airspace of Yehudah?! Only Binyamin's portion has Kedushas Mizbe'ach!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> They stipulated that Yehudah received the land, but the airspace belonged to Binyamin (Rashi - and a platform was built there to collect the blood).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'there was no Yesod there'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The Yesod physically did not extend to that corner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Levi):</span> (It physically extended to the corner, but) Halachically it was not considered Yesod (to put Shirayim there).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav holds that the Targum of (Bereishis 49:27) "Binyamin Ze'ev Yitrof..." says that the Mizbe'ach will be built in Binyamin's portion (Yehudah had no share in it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Levi holds that the Targum says that Mikdesha will be built in his portion, i.e. the place sactified to receive blood. (Yehudah had a share in the Mizbe'ach, but not to receive blood.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Levi - Mishnah):</span> The Yesod went across the entire northern and western sides. It was Ochel (occupied) one Amah on the southern and eastern sides.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Was Ochel' means that it (is the part that) received blood (but there was a physical Yesod around all sides).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Mishnah):</span> The Yesod was 32 Amos by 32 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah gives the dimensions of the northern and western sides.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Beraisa):</span> The ramp (which came up to the south side) covered the Amah of the Yesod (the Mizbe'ach was recessed from it), and (likewise regarding) the Amah of the Sovev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The ramp covered the Amah where the Yesod would have been (if it spanned the south side).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Levi - Beraisa):</span> To build the Mizbe'ach, we bring a frame 32 Amos square and one Amah tall; and whole, smooth stones (big and small), plaster, molten lead and pitch. We mix them and pour it into the frame (to form the Yesod);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We then bring a frame 30 Amos square (centered above the Yesod) and five Amos tall, and do the same;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The next frame is 28 Amos square and three Amos tall, we do the same;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The last frame is one cubic Amah (for each Keren).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps after making a square Yesod, we cut off (all but one Amah of) the southern and eastern sides.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Torah requires "Avanim Shelemos"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Before pouring in the mixture, we insert beams to fill up the extra Amah on the two sides. This reduces the size of the mold.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> Rav Kahana must say so about the Keranos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> The stones on the Keranos were hollow - "u'Mal'u ka'Mizrak k'Zaviyos Mizbe'ach";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah requires "Avanim Shelemos"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Before pouring in the mixture, we insert something inside, and later remove it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>FINDING THE SITE OF THE <i>BEIS HA'MIKDASH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> "V'David... u'Shmuel va'Yeshvu... b'Noyos ba'Ramah" - what is the connection of Noyos to Ramah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> David and Shmuel were in Ramah, engaging in the Noy (beauty) of the world (the Beis ha'Mikdash);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">David and Shmuel:</span> "V'Kamta v'Alisa" teaches that the Beis ha'Mikdash is the highest place in Eretz Yisrael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Eretz Yisrael is the highest of all lands.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They did not know the highest place in Eretz Yisrael. They looked through Sefer Yehoshua, and noticed that regarding the portion of Binyamin it always says "v'Alah ha'Gevul." Regarding the other Shevatim it sometimes says that the border goes up, down or around;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>They concluded that the highest place is in Binyamin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>They thought to build it in Ein Eitam, which is the highest place. They decided that it should be slightly lower, due to "u'Vein Keseifav Shachen" (between the shoulders, which is just below the highest part, i.e. the head).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Alternatively, they had a tradition that the Great Sanhedrin must sit in (Lishkas ha'Gazis in the Beis ha'Mikdash,) in the portion of Yehudah, whereas the Shechinah (i.e. the Azarah) is in Binyamin's portion;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If they would build it in Ein Eitam, this would be too far from the portion of Yehudah. Therefore, it is better to build it slightly lower (closer to Yehudah);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>They concluded that this is why it says "u'Vein Keseifav Shachen."</p></div>
