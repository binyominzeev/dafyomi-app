<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MAY <i>KORBANOS</i> BE OFFERED ON THE FLOOR? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can R. Yosi say that the Mizbe'ach was 10 Amos tall? It says "v'Shalosh Amos Komaso"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Excluding the Keranos) it was three Amos above the Sovev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah says that the Gezerah Shavah ("Ravu'a- Ravu'a") teaches only about the length and width, but not the height.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah said that surely the Mizbe'ach was three Amos tall and not 10, for then people would be able to see the Avodah from the outside. He himself holds that the curtains around Chatzer ha'Mishkan were only five Amos tall. If so, people could see the Kohanim on top of the Mizbe'ach (from where they throw limbs or Eimurim onto the fire! An average man is three Amos tall at the shoulder.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, people could see the Kohanim, but not the Avodah (e.g. limbs or Eimurim in their hands).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yehudah, we understand why it says that Shlomo "Kidesh" (i.e. the floor, so that Korbanos could be burned on it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to R. Yosi why does it say "Kidesh"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was Mekadesh the floor to which the Mizbe'ach would be attached.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yosi, we understand why it says that Moshe's Mizbe'ach was "Katan" (too small for all the Korbanos);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to R. Yehudah why is it called "Katan"? Also Shlomo's Mizbe'ach was not big enough!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that (also) the Mizbe'ach that Shlomo made in place of Moshe's was too small.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of their argument?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi holds that we learn about a Kli (Mizbe'ach ha'Nechoshes) from a Kli (Mizbe'ach ha'Zahav), but not from something attached (Shlomo's Mizbe'ach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that we learn about something outside (of the Heichal, i.e. Mizbe'ach ha'Nechoshes) from something outside (Shlomo's Mizbe'ach), but not from something in the Heichal (Mizbe'ach ha'Zahav).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Yehudah agrees that blood must be offered on the Mizbe'ach, not on the floor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> They would gather a bucket from the blood on the floor from all the Korbanos (Pesach) and throw it on the Mizbe'ach, to be Machshir a Korban (in case its blood spilled).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the floor was valid for blood, the Korban is Kosher. There is no need to throw the blood on the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the blood must be put (on the Mizbe'ach or floor) through a human action. (It is invalid if it spilled accidentally.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we could collect and spill the blood right there. There would be no need to put it on the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps we put it on the Mizbe'ach to do the Mitzvah in the best way.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WE CANNOT EAT <i>KODSHIM</i> WITHOUT A <i>MIZBE'ACH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If the Mizbe'ach became dented, we cannot (rely on it to) eat the remains of Menachos - "v'Ichluha Matzos Etzel ha'Mizbe'ach";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They need not be eaten at the Mizbe'ach! (They may be eaten anywhere in the Azarah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, this teaches that they must be eaten when the Mizbe'ach is intact, but not when it is deficient.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about the remainder of Menachos (after the Kometz was taken). What is the source for other Kodshei Kodoshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Kodesh-Kodoshim".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Kodshim Kalim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We expound like R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Beraisa - R. Yosi citing R. Yishmael) Suggestion: Perhaps nowadays (after the Churban) we may bring Ma'aser Sheni to Yerushalayim and eat it there!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Mah Matzinu refutes this! Bechor and Ma'aser both must be brought to Yerushalayim. Just like Bechor may be eaten only when the Mikdash stands, also Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from Bechor. Its blood and Chelev must be put on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Bikurim shows that this is not the reason. No part of them goes on the Mizbe'ach, and they may be eaten only when the Mikdash stands!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from Bikurim. They must be placed on the ground in front of the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Va'Haveisem Shamah... (Masroseichem...u'Vchoros...)" equates Ma'aser and Bechor. Just like Bechor may be eaten only when the Mikdash stands, also Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why couldn't we learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah of Bechor and Bikurim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from them, for both of them are put (at least partially) on or in front of the Mizbe'ach. This does not apply to Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Tana's opinion (about the Kedushah of Yerushalayim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he holds that the Kedushah is permanent (i.e. even after the Churban), also Bechor is permitted today (for also the Kedushah of the Mikdash is permanent. We could build the Mizbe'ach in its place and offer Korbanos!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If he holds that the Kedushah was not permanent (it is Batel after the Churban), he should be equally unsure about Bechor!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> If he holds that the Kedushah was not permanent, this applies also to Ma'aser! (It is forbidden even in Yerushalayim; alternate texts - it is permitted outside of Yerushalayim.) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> He holds that the Kedushah was not (our text, Rashi; Tosfos - was) permanent. The case is, the Bechor's blood was thrown before the Churban, and the meat is intact after the Churban;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The meat is equated to the blood. Just like the blood requires a Mizbe'ach (to be offered), also the meat (cannot be eaten without a Mizbe'ach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We learn Ma'aser from Bechor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Something learned from a Hekesh cannot teach another law through a Hekesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That applies only to Kodshim. Ma'aser of produce is Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that it depends on whether the matter being learned is Kodshim or Chulin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to the opinion that it depends on the source from which we learn, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Blood and meat are like one. (It is as if meat was learned directly, without a Hekesh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah:</span> Chachamim of Bavel (i.e. Abaye) err greatly!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> (In the Midbar,) when Bnei Yisrael moved to a new encampment (and dissembled the Mishkan), Kodshim became Pesulim, Zavim were expelled from the boundaries of Shevet Levi, and Metzora'im were expelled from Machaneh Yisrael. (The latter law shows that the Kedushah of the Machanos remains. Presumably, Kodshim become Pesulim because Kedushas ha'Mizbe'ach lapses when it is being moved.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> Kodshim may be eaten in two places (encampments).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Kodshei Kodoshim become Pesulim when the Mizbe'ach is uprooted, but Kodshim Kalim do not become Pesulim (even when Kedushas Mizbe'ach lapses)!</p></div>
