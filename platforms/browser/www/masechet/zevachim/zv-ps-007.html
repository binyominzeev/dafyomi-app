<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 - Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If the goats (of the Tzibur) of Shavu'os were slaughtered at the same time and their blood was received in different Kelim, after throwing the blood of one, why do we throw the blood of the other?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> It atones for Tum'ah that occurred in between the two Zerikos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yirmeyah asked only whether a Korban (i.e. the second) can atone for a transgression after it was slaughtered. This implies that he was sure that it can atone for a transgression after it was Hukdash!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Yirmeyah was unsure also about that;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He asked, if you will say that that it can atone for a transgression after it was Hukdash, can it atone for a transgression after it was slaughtered?</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>KORBANOS OFFERED SHE'LO LISHMAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If Reuven's Todah was slaughtered l'Shem Shimon (who was Makdish a Todah for himself), it is Kosher. (Reuven was Yotzei. Shinuy Ba'alim only applies if it was on condition to do Zerikah for someone else);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> It is Pasul. (I.e. he was not Yotzei, but the Korban is Kosher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rabah for himself - Beraisa - Aba Chavin):</span> "U'Vesar Zevach Todas Shelamav" teaches that if a Todah was slaughtered l'Shem Shelamim, it is Kosher. If a Shelamim was slaughtered l'Shem Todah, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the cases?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Todah is called a Shelamim (it is a type of Shelamim). A (regular) Shelamim is not called a Todah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If a Shelamim was slaughtered l'Shem Todah, it is Pasul, but a Todah slaughtered l'Shem a different Todah is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that if Reuven's Todah was slaughtered l'Shem Shimon's Todah, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it means that Reuven's Todah was slaughtered l'Shem a different Todah of his (e.g. for a different danger that Hash-m saved him from), it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If when Reuven's Todah was slaughtered l'Shem Shimon's Todah it is Pasul, the Beraisa should have taught this, all the more so we would know that a Shelamim slaughtered l'Shem Todah is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It needed to teach about a Shelamim that was slaughtered l'Shem Todah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since Todah is called Shelamim, also Shelamim is called Todah. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven's Chatas was slaughtered l'Shem Chatas (Rashi - his own Chatas for a different transgression; R. Tam - Shimon's Chatas), it is Kosher (and Reuven was Yotzei);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was slaughtered l'Shem Olah, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Shachat Osah l'Chatas" - as long as it was slaughtered l'Shem Chatas, it is fully Kosher, but not if it was slaughtered l'Shem Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven's Chatas was slaughtered for Shimon, and Shimon must bring a Chatas, it is (totally) Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Shimon is obligated to bring (Rashi - and already was Makdish) an Olah, it is Kosher (but Reuven was not Yotzei).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Chiper Alav" - not for someone else;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Intent for) the other person disqualifies the Korban only if he resembles Reuven, i.e. he needs the same Kaparah. (Shimon does not need Kaparah from a Chatas. His Olah will atone for him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven's <i>Chatas</i> (our text; some texts say 'Olah') was slaughtered on behalf of Shimon, and Shimon (thinks that he) need not bring any Korban, it is (totally) Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely, Shimon once was Mevatel an Aseh (but since he does not know this, he will not bring an Olah), so a Chatas could atone for him (like Rava taught).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A Chatas atones for Bitul Aseh.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A Kal va'Chomer teaches this. A Chatas atones for Chayavei Kerisus. All the more so, it atones for Bitul Aseh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since Chatas atones also for Bitul Aseh, why did Rava say that if a Chatas was slaughtered for someone obligated to bring a Chatas, it is Pasul, but if it was for someone obligated to bring an Olah (i.e. he was Mevatel an Aseh), it is Kosher?!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chatas gives a small Kaparah for Bitul Aseh, but not a major Kaparah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If an Olah was slaughtered Lo Lishmah, one may not throw the blood Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>We can learn from reasoning or a verse.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A verse - "...v'Asisa Ka'asher Nodarta...Nedavah" (if you did as you vowed, i.e. the Zevach was slaughtered Lishmah, it is a Neder. If not, it is a Nedavah. A Nedavah may not be offered Lo Lishmah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reasoning - because it was (improperly) slaughtered Lo Lishmah, should we do another Avodah Lo Lishmah?!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If heirs inherited an Olah and it was offered b'Shinuy Kodesh, it is Pasul (it is Kosher, but the heirs must bring another Korban). If it was offered b'Shinuy Ba'alim, it is (fully) Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Pinchas brei d'Rav Ami):</span> Shinuy Ba'alim applies even after the owner died.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Do you argue with Rava, and say that the heirs must bring another Korban?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Or, do you just mean that (if the heirs were Mevatel an Aseh,) if it was offered properly, they get Kaparah, but if there was Shinuy Ba'alim, it does not atone for them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Pinchas:</span> I argue with Rava.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> An Olah is a gift (even though it is brought for Bitul Aseh, its essence is not a Korban of Kaparah):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the owner did not repent, Hash-m does not desire his Korban - "Zevach Resha'im To'evah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he repented, he already got Kaparah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one transgressed an Aseh and repented, Hash-m immediately pardons him!</p></div>
