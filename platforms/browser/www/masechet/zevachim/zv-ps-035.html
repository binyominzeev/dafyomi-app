<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The blood that spilled is mixed with a much greater quantity of Dam Tamtzis (blood that exudes before or after the animal dies). It is Batel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah holds that Dam Tamtzis is also considered blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Lav forbids Dam Tamtzis;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it is Chayvei Kerisus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar taught that R. Yehudah admits that Dam Tamtzis is not Mechaper!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"B'Nefesh Yechaper" - only Dam ha'Nefesh (that exudes when the animal is dying) is Mechaper.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We know (from elsewhere) that R. Yehudah holds that blood is not Mevatel blood (because it is Min b'Mino).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> According to you, why do they plug up the Azarah (to keep the blood inside)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> This shows the praise of Kohanim. They are up to their knees in blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The blood is a Chatzitzah between the Kohen and the floor!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is wet, so it is not a Chatzitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are a Chatzitzah if they are dry, not if they are wet - blood, ink, honey, and milk.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen served with dirty clothes, the Avodah is Pasul.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Mido" - his garments must be like his Midah (size). They cannot be too long or short.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Their clothes may be dirty when they take the limbs to the ramp. This is not Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> "V'Hikriv ha'Kohen Es ha'Kol" refers to taking limbs to the ramp. (It is called Hakravah, which is Avodah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, their clothes may be dirty when they bring wood to the Ma'arachah (the pile on the Mizbe'ach). This is not Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Kohanim who do Avodah must keep their garments clean. How can they do this (if they are up to their knees in blood)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They stand on platforms. (They are like the floor, so they are not Chatzizos.)</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>After Shechitah, they have full Kedushas Mizbe'ach. They become Teme'im if a Tevul Yom or Mechusar Kipurim touched them. Linah (being left overnight) disqualifies them.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> Me'ilah applies to them even in Beis ha'Deshen, until the meat melts.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa repeats 'they do not make Pigul, and they do not become Pigul.' Surely, this is to teach that even if the Korban is Pigul, Pigul does not apply to them!</p></div>
