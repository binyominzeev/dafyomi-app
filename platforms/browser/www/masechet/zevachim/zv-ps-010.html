<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a Korban was slaughtered Lishmah with intent to do Zerikah Lo Lishmah, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> It is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan says that it is Pasul. We consider it as if this Avodah (Shechitah) was done with the (Lo Lishmah) intent for the later Avodah (Zerikah);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We learn from Pigul. (If one of the four Avodos was done with intent Chutz li'Zmano (to eat the meat, do Zerikah, or burn the Eimurim after the proper time), the Korban is Pasul, as if this Avodah was done improperly.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish says that it is Kosher. Intent for a later Avodah does not affect this Avodah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We do not learn from Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish argued similarly elsewhere.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one slaughtered a (Chulin) animal in order to pour the blood or burn the Chelev to idolatry, the animal is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He holds that since he later intends to serve idolatry with this animal, we consider the current Avodah (Shechitah) to be l'Shem idolatry;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>We learn from Avodah in the Mikdash (Pigul) to Chulin outside the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The animal is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We do not consider the current Avodah to be l'Shem idolatry, because we do not learn from Avodah in the Mikdash to outside the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>We needed to teach their argument in both cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had we taught only regarding idolatry, one might have thought that Reish Lakish agrees about Lo Lishmah. It applies in the Mikdash, so we learn from Pigul in the Mikdash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had we taught only regarding Lo Lishmah, one might have thought that R. Yochanan agrees about idolatry. It applies outside the Mikdash, so we do not learn from Pigul in the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> Presumably, R. Yochanan is correct!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Pigul, if one says 'I (will) slaughter Chutz li'Zmano' (but he slaughtered in the proper time, his intent is meaningless), it is Kosher, but if he slaughters with intent to do Zerikah Chutz li'Zmano, the Korban is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding Lo Lishmah, if one slaughters Lo Lishmah, it is Pasul. All the more so, if he slaughters with intent to do Zerikah Lo Lishmah, it is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava bar Ahilai):</span> You cannot learn from Pigul (it is more stringent), one who eats it is Chayav Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava bar Ahilai):</span> We can support R. Yochanan from intent (in one of the four Avodos) Chutz li'Mkomo (to eat the meat, do Zerikah, or burn the Eimurim outside the permitted place. This forbids the meat, but there is no Kares for it. Sometimes the Gemara calls this Pigul; this is imprecise.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one says 'I slaughter Chutz li'Mkomo' (but slaughters in the proper place), it is Kosher, but if he slaughters with intent to do Zerikah Chutz li'Mkomo, the Korban is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding Lo Lishmah, if one slaughters Lo Lishmah, it is Pasul. All the more so, if he slaughters with intent to do Zerikah Lo Lishmah, it is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> You cannot learn from intent Chutz li'Mkomo, which totally disqualifies all Zevachim. Lo Lishmah (totally) disqualifies only Chatas and Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> We can support R. Yochanan from Shinuy Ba'alim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one says 'I slaughter l'Shem Ploni (not the owner)', it is Kosher. If he slaughters with intent to do Zerikah l'Shem Ploni, the Korban is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding Shinuy Kodesh, if one slaughters l'Shem a different Zevach, it is Pasul. All the more so, if he slaughters with intent to do Zerikah l'Shem a different Zevach, it is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ila):</span> Presumably Reish Lakish is correct!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There was no need for the Torah to teach that Zerikah Lo Lishmah disqualifies a Korban. We could have learned from a Tzad ha'Shavah of Shechitah and Kabalah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Torah taught about Lo Lishmah in Zerikah to teach that we do not consider the current Avodah as if it were done with the intent for the later Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps the Torah wrote it to teach that we <i>do</i> consider the current Avodah as if it were done with the intent for the later Avodah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Without a verse we would know this from the Kal va'Chomer of Rav Ashi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan disagrees. He says that we cannot learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah of Shechitah and Kabalah, because both of them must be done in the north half of the Azarah (regarding Kodshei Kodoshim), and they apply to inner Chata'os. These stringencies do not apply to Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Ila learns from the Tzad ha'Shavah, since we learn from a verse discussing Shelamim (Kodshim Kalim), in which these stringencies of Shechitah and Kabalah do not apply.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If a Korban was slaughtered Lishmah with intent to do Zerikah Lo Lishmah, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> It is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Rabah later retracted and agreed with Rav Nachman, due to the Kal va'Chomer of Rav Ashi.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>AN <i>ASHAM</i> THAT WAS OFFERED <i>SHE'LO LISHMAH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> Also Asham (is Pasul if slaughtered Lo Lishmah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Chatas and Asham both come for transgression. Just like Chatas Lo Lishmah is (totally) Pasul, also Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> You cannot learn from Chatas, for its blood is put on the top of the Mizbeach (but an Asham's blood is thrown on the bottom half of the Mizbeach)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Pesach proves that this is not the essential reason. Its blood is thrown on the bottom half of the Mizbeach, and Pesach Lo Lishmah is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> You cannot learn from Pesach, for it is offered at a fixed time of the year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Chatas proves that this is not the essential reason. (There is no fixed time to offer it, and it is Pasul Lo Lishmah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Again I say that you cannot learn from Chatas (for its blood is put on the top of the Mizbeach)!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> I can learn from verses:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We learn from "Chatas Hi" and "Pesach Hu" that Lo Lishmah disqualifies Chatas and Pesach. we learn similarly from "Asham Hu"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> No. Regarding Chatas and Pesach, it says "Hi" and "Hu" regarding Shechitah, to teach that these are Kosher only if slaughtered Lishmah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Regarding Asham, it says "Hu" only after the Eimurim are burned. This cannot disqualify if the Eimurim are burned Lo Lishmah, for even if they are not burned at all, the Korban is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> It says "ka'Chatas ka'Asham" - just like Chatas Lo Lishmah is Pasul, also Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehoshua said 'again I say that you cannot learn from Chatas.' Why can't R. Eliezer learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah of Chatas and Pesach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both pertain to Kares (Chatas atones for Chayavei Kerisus, and one who does not offer Korban Pesach is Chayav Kares). We cannot learn to Asham, which does not pertain to Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehoshua said 'you cannot learn from Chatas, for its blood is put on the top of the Mizbeach';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Why didn't he say that we cannot learn from Chatas, because the blood of (inner) Chata'os is brought in the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Eliezer learns from outer Chata'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say that we cannot learn from outer Chata'os, because if their blood enters the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim, they are Pasul?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer holds that the same applies to Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say that we cannot learn from Chatas, because it atones for Chayavei Kerisus?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Eliezer learns from the Chatas brought for Shevu'as ha'Edus (which has no Kares).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say that we cannot learn from Chatas, because its blood is thrown four times?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Eliezer holds like R. Yishmael, who says that also Asham requires four Zerikos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even so, blood of Chata'os is put with the finger, and it is put either on the Keranos (top corners of the Mizbeach) or on the edge. These do not apply to Asham!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to questions (e), (i) and (k)):</span> R. Yehoshua could have asked other questions. He asked only one.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHERE THE BLOOD OF AN <i>ASHAM</i> IS THROWN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehoshua said 'you cannot learn from Chatas, for its blood is put on the top of the Mizbeach.' Why didn't R. Eliezer answer that also an Asham's blood is put on the top of the Mizbeach (because the Torah equates it to Chatas)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that an Asham's blood is not put on the top of the Mizbeach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An Olah is entirely burned on the Mizbeach, yet its blood is put on the bottom of the Mizbeach - an Asham is (less Kodesh, it is) not entirely burned, all the more so its blood is put on the bottom of the Mizbeach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> An Olah does not atone. We cannot learn from it to an Asham, which atones!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chatas ha'Of (a bird) proves that this is not the reason. (It atones, yet its blood is put on the bottom of the Mizbeach!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Chatas ha'Of, for it is not a Zevach. (It is not killed through Shechitah, rather, through Melikah (using the thumbnail to cut the Simanim)!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Olah proves that this is not the reason! (It is a Zevach, and its blood is put on the bottom.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Each has its own stringency. The Tzad ha'Shavah of them is that they are Kodshei Kodoshim and their blood is put on the bottom. The same applies to Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava of Parzakiya):</span> We cannot learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah, because there is no minimal price of an Olah or Chatas ha'Of, but one must pay at least two Shekalim for an Asham!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava of Parzakiya):</span> R. Eliezer learns from "ha'Kohen ha'Mechatei <i>Osah</i>" - a Chatas' blood goes above, but blood of other Korbanos does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should likewise expound "v'Shachat <i>Osah</i> l'Chatas" - a Chatas Lo Lishmah is Pasul, but any other Korban is not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot expound that "Osah" that way, for (verses prove that) Pesach Lo Lishmah is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Likewise, the other "Osah" cannot teach that blood of all other Korbanos does not go above, for blood of Olas ha'Of goes above!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It teaches that Chatas is the only <i>Zevach</i> (i.e. animal Korban) whose blood goes above.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Eliezer holds like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon, who says that the blood of Olas ha'Of is not put in the same place as that of Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Blood that is thrown on the bottom (part of the Mizbeach) must be thrown on the Chut ha'Sikra (a red string separating the top and bottom halves of the Mizbe'ach) or below. Blood that is thrown on top must be thrown on the Chut ha'Sikra or above;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, that applies to Olas ha'Of, but the blood of Chatas Behemah must be put on the Keranos.</p></div>
