<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Ila'a and Tuvya were relatives of the Arev (cosigner) of a loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Since they are not relatives of the lender or borrower, they may testify about the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> If the borrower cannot pay, the lender collects from the Arev! (Therefore, they are relatives of a party in the case, and they cannot testify.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Beis Din sentenced Ploni to die and he fled, and he came before the same Beis Din again, the verdict stands. We do not judge him again.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Tarfon and R. Akiva say, had we sat on the Sanhedrin, no one would ever have been killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, that is improper. People would not fear Beis Din, and murders would increase!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW OFTEN SANHEDRIN SHOULD KILL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Sanhedrin that kills... (R. Eliezer ben Azaryah says, once in 70 years).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Eliezer ben Azaryah mean that even once in 70 years is brutal? Or, is this a proper frequency?</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How would they exempt everyone?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan and R. Elazar):</span> They would ask the witnesses 'did you check (after the murder) whether the victim was Treifah (would have died even if not murdered, due to a fatal cut or puncture...)?'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> If the witnesses said that he was not Treifah, they would ask 'perhaps there was a hole where the murderer inserted the knife!' (Ramban - this means, perhaps there was a hole that you could have seen had you lifted up his clothing before the stabbing. Surely they do not ask about an internal hole that witnesses could never know about. R. Tam - if they do not know, the testimony is invalid. Tosfos - if they do not know, the testimony is valid. They would ask a barrage of questions, and almost certainly the witnesses would contradict each other about something, invalidating the testimony.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In a case of Arayos, what would they ask?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye and Rava):</span> They would ask if they explicitly saw the contact of the genitals. (Witnesses would never look so closely.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim (who argue with R. Tarfon and R. Akiva) consider sufficient testimony of Bi'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like Shmuel said. It suffices if they acted (lied together) like adulterers.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>One who killed b'Shogeg is exiled in the following cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He was pushing a Ma'agilah (a block or roller) to plaster the roof, and it fell from his hands and killed someone. (Rashi - the mortar is thickest in the middle of the roof, so he was pushing it down a slight incline);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He was lowering a barrel. It fell from his hands and killed someone;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He was going down a ladder, and he fell and killed someone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He is not exiled in the following cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He was pulling a Ma'agilah back to himself, and it fell;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He was raising a barrel. The rope snapped, and the barrel fell;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He was ascending a ladder, and he fell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The general rule is, if he killed doing anything Derech Yeridah (in a downward motion), he is exiled;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For anything not done Derech Yeridah, he is not exiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> "Va'Yipol Alav va'Yamos" - he is exiled only if the accident happened (when he was engaging in a downward motion,) the way things fall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Bi'Shgagah" excludes Mezid. "Bi'Vli Da'as" excludes one who intended.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If he was Mezid, obviously he is not exiled. He is killed (Tosfos - by Beis Din. A different verse teaches about Mezid without warning; Ritva - even if he is not killed, even if he was Karov l'Mezid, surely he is not exiled!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It excludes (something close to) Mezid, i.e. Omer Mutar (he thought that murder is permitted)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> It excludes one who intended to kill an animal, a Nochri or a Nefel, and he killed a viable Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Im b'Fesa" excludes one who (was carrying a knife and) killed when he turned a corner (he did not see the victim in time). "B'Lo Eivah" excludes if he hated the victim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Hadafo" - his body pushed him. "Oh Hishlich Alav" includes Yeridah for the sake of Aliyah (an upward motion).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"B'Lo Tzediyah" excludes one who intended to throw in one direction, and it went in another direction;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Va'Asher Lo Tzadah" excludes one who intended to throw two Amos, and it went four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Va'Asher Yavo Es Re'ehu va'Ya'ar" - Galus applies only when the killer and victim both were allowed to be there, like in a forest.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> This is Yeridah for the sake of Aliyah. (The Beraisa says that he is exiled for this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The general rule is, for anything done Derech Yeridah, he is exiled. For anything not Derech Yeridah, he is not exiled.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> What does the Reisha (anything done Derech Yeridah) come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that it includes someone chopping meat (Yeridah for the sake of Aliyah, as we will explain);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question 1):</span> Likewise, the Seifa includes someone chopping (Aliyah for the sake of Yeridah, and he is not exiled).</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Resolution:</span> Wherever it says that he is liable, the case is, he was swinging down. Wherever it says that he is exempt, he was swinging up. (E.g. Beraisa #1 obligates in front when he was swinging down. It exempts in back when he was swinging up, even though this was for the sake of Yeridah, to chop down strongly in front.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rambam):</span> If he killed while swinging back, he is exempt. If he killed while swinging forward, he is exiled. (E.g.
