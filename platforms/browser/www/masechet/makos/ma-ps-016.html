<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HASRA'AS SAFEK AND LAV SHE'EIN BO MA'ASEH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Each of them teaches like he taught elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> If Reuven swore 'I will eat this loaf today' and he did not eat it, he is not lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is not lashed because this Lav does not come through an action;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He is not lashed because he cannot receive definite warning (perhaps he will eat the loaf later), and Safek warning is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>They both explain R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Lo Sosiru (do not leave over from the Korban Pesach until morning)... veha'Nosar... ba'Esh Tisrofu (burn what is left over)" - the verse gives an Aseh to fix the Lav, therefore one is not lashed for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan infers, had the Torah not given an Aseh, one would be lashed for it, even though the warning is doubtful (perhaps he will finish eating before morning)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Reish Lakish infers, had the Torah not given an Aseh, one would be lashed for it, even though Ein Bo Ma'aseh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't Reish Lakish also learn like R. Yochanan, that doubtful warning is (proper) warning?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like a different Tana according to R. Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If we are unsure if Reuven is the son of David or Moshe, and Reuven strikes or curses David and Moshe, one after the other or at the same time, he is liable (even though the warning is doubtful);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, he is liable only if he struck or cursed both at the same time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Yochanan also learn like Reish Lakish, that one is lashed for a Lav she'Ein Bo Ma'aseh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like the following teaching;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan citing R. Yehudah citing R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> One is lashed for a Lav that is done through an action;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The only Lavim without an action for which one is lashed are swearing (falsely), Temurah and cursing a person with Hash-m's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to both R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish, R. Yehudah contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1 (for Reish Lakish):</span> Tana'im argue about the opinion of R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2 (for R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yehudah himself holds that one is lashed for Lav she'Ein Bo Ma'aseh. He said in the name of R. Yosi ha'Galili that one is not lashed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LASHES FOR NOT FULFILLING THE <i>ASEH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If one takes a mother bird sitting on her chicks or eggs, he is lashed, and he has no Mitzvah to send it away;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, he sends it away, and he is not lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The general rule is, one is not lashed for a Lav which has an Aseh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> There is only one other such Mitzvah (in which lashes depend on failure to fulfill the Aseh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> Which is the other Mitzvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Go investigate!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar - Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael raped a woman and divorced her, he remarries her, and he is not lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Kohen (who may not marry a divorcee) did so, he is lashed, and he does not remarry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Yisrael is not lashed, even though the Aseh precedes the Lav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand according to the opinion Kiymo v'Lo Kiymo. He is lashed if he does not remarry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion Bitlo v'Lo Bitlo, we understand how he can (permanently) Mevatel the Mitzvah to send the mother bird (he can kill it), but how can a rapist be Mevatel the Mitzvah to remarry her?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he kills her, he is not lashed, for he is Chayav Misah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Simi of Chuzna'ah):</span> He accepted Kidushin for her from another man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav):</span> If she made him her Shali'ach, she was Mevatel the Mitzvah. If she did not, he cannot accept Kidushin for her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Simi of Chuzna'ah):</span> He vowed in public not to remarry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that a vow taken in public can never be permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to the opinion that it can be permitted, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He vowed Al Da'as Rabim (according to the will of many people).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> The Halachah is, a vow taken in public can be permitted, but a vow Al Da'as Rabim cannot be permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are more (Mitzvos in which lashes depend on failure to fulfill the Aseh)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> It says "v'Lo Sigzol", and "v'Heshiv Es ha'Gezelah" (a Mitzvah to return the theft)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> "Lo Savo El Beiso La'avot Avoto" (do not enter the borrower's house to take a security. If you did, return it -) "Hashev Tashiv Lo Es ha'Avot"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One can be lashed for these, whether one holds Kiymo v'Lo Kiymo (he does not return it) or Bitlo v'Lo Bitlo (he destroys it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both qestions):</span> Since he must pay for it, he is not lashed in addition to this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If someone took a convert's security and the convert died (without heirs), there is no one to pay! (He should be lashed!)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When he destroyed the security, he became liable to pay (and not be lashed). When the convert died, his obligation to pay went away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> "Lo Sechaleh Pe'as... (do not harvest your entire field. Rather, leave a corner for the poor. If you did not, give the poor from what you harvested -) "le'Ani vela'Ger Ta'azov Osam"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One can be lashed for this, whether one holds Kiymo v'Lo Kiymo or Bitlo v'Lo Bitlo!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Pe'ah should be designated and left attached (the poor take it themselves). If the owner harvested his entire field, he separates (the amount which should have been left) from the sheaves (and gives it to the poor); if this was not done, he separates from the stack before Miru'ach (final processing);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Miru'ach was already done, he separates the proper amount, takes Ma'aseros on it, and gives it to the poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>(However, if he ground the grain, he acquires it like a thief, and he can no longer fulfill the Mitzvah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He holds like R. Yishmael, who says that, even if he made a dough, he separates from the dough and gives to the poor. (He still did not acquire it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even according to R. Yishmael, if he ate the dough, he can no longer fulfill the Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to questions (b) and (n)):</span> Rather, the other Mitzvah (in which lashes depend on failure to fulfill the Aseh) is Pe'ah. A rapist is never lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if he vowed not to remarry her, it can be permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A vow Al Da'as Rabim cannot be permitted for Reshus, but it can be permitted for the sake of a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>There was a teacher of children who used to hit them too much. Rav Acha made him vow (Al Da'as Rabim) that he would not teach children anymore;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Ravina (permitted the vow and) reinstated him, because they could not find someone else who teaches so well.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MULTIPLE LASHES FOR EATING INSECTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who eats Neveilos, Treifos, Shekatzim u'Rmasim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one ate a worm found in cabbage, he is lashed for "ha'Sheretz ha'Shoretz Al ha'Aretz (may not be eaten)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yehudah lashed a man who ate such a worm.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If one ate Potisa (a bug found in water), he is lashed four times (there are two Lavim for water Sheratzim, and two Lavim for all kinds of Sheratzim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one ate an ant, he is lashed five times (there are two Lavim for all Sheratzim, and three Lavim for land Sheratzim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he ate a wasp, he is lashed six times (for the above five and for "Sheretz ha'Of").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Achai):</span> If one urgently needs to excrete and holds it in, he transgresses "v'Lo Seshaktzu (do not make yourselves detestable)";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> If one drinks from a bloodletter's vessel (which is disgusting), he transgresses "v'Lo Seshaktzu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> If one ground up nine ants and completed the quantity of a k'Zayis with a live (Rashi; Tosfos - intact) ant, he is lashed five times for eating a full creation (an ant, like Abaye taught) and once for eating a k'Zayis of Neveilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The same applies if he ground up two ants and a full ant completed a k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The same applies if one minced ant and a full ant comprised a k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>They do not argue. Rabah discusses small ants, Rava discusses bigger ants, and Rav Yosef discusses very big ants.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>LASHES FOR EATING <i>TEVEL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who eats Tevel or Ma'aser Rishon...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one ate Tevel to Ma'aser Oni (Peros from which Ma'aser Oni was not taken), he is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This is like the following Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi) Question:</span> Perhaps one is liable only for Tevel from which no Terumah or Ma'aser was taken. What is the source to obligate for Tevel from which Terumah was taken, but not Ma'aser Rishon, or (also Ma'aser Rishon was taken but not) Ma'aser Sheni or even Ma'aser Oni?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Lo Suchal Le'echol bi'Sh'arecha", and "v'Ochlu vi'Sh'arecha v'Sove'u";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The latter refers to Ma'aser Oni. Likewise, the former forbids Peros that still 'contain' (i.e. are Tevel to) Ma'aser Oni.</p>
