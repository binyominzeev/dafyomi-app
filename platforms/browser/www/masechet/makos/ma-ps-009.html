<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN DOES A GER TOSHAV GO TO GALUS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mishnah):</span> (Anyone can get Galus for killing a Yisrael, and a Yisrael can get Galus for killing anyone,) except for a Ger Toshav...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A Ger Toshav (does not get or obligate Galus. Regarding Galus he) is like a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Seifa):</span> A Ger Toshav can get Galus for killing a Ger Toshav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> He is not exiled for killing a Yisrael, but he is exiled for killing a Ger Toshav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Contradiction:</span> It says "li'Vnei Yisrael vela'Ger.." (Arei Miklat are also for Gerei Toshav);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says also "Lachem", but not for Gerei Toshav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> A Ger Toshav is not exiled for killing a Yisrael. He is exiled for killing a Ger Toshav. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> (Bnei Noach do not need warning for their Mitzvos.) Therefore, if a Nochri or Ger (Toshav) killed, he is killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa equates a Ger Toshav to a Nochri. Just like a Nochri is killed whether or not he killed someone of his own status (another Nochri), also a Ger Toshav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> If a Ger Toshav killed (a Ger Toshav) Derech Yeridah, for which a Yisrael is exiled, Galus suffices also for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he killed Derech Aliyah, for which a Yisrael is exempt, he is killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> A Kal va'Chomer refutes this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Yisrael is exiled for Derech Yeridah, and a Ger Toshav is not killed for this. A Yisrael is exempt for Derech Aliyah, and all the more so a Ger Toshav is not killed for this! <span class="note">(<span class="notewd">Note:</span> Rav Chisda holds that a Derech Aliyah is close to Mezid, and he does not merit Galus. The Go'el ha'Dam (the closest relative of the victim) can kill him anywhere, at any time.)</span></p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OMER MUTAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> A Ger Toshav is killed for Omer Mutar (he thought that it is permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Omer Mutar is Ones!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> I say that it is close to Mezid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Rav Chisda did not establish the Beraisa as Rava did, for he holds like Abaye. Perhaps this forced him to hold that Derech Aliyah is close to Mezid.) Rav Chisda and Rava argued similarly elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a Ger Toshav killed a person, thinking that he was an animal, or killed a Ger Toshav, thinking that he was a Nochri, he is Chayav (Misah). Omer Mutar is close to Mezid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> He is exempt. Omer Mutar is Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> "Hincha Mes Al ha'Ishah" (even though Avimelech did not know that Sarah was married).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He is Chayav Misas Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> No, he is Chayav Misah b'Yedei Shamayim (at the hands of Heaven).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> "Mi'Chato Li" (the sin would be punishable only by Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Yosef likewise told Potifar's wife "v'Chotasi l'Eilokim", even though adultery (b'Mezid) is punishable by Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also Avimelech's sin would have been punishable by Beis Din, even though he was Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> It says "ha'Goy Gam Tzadik Taharog"! (Because he was Shogeg, it is considered as if he did not sin, and Hash-m did not refute him!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Hash-m refuted him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Hashev Eshes ha'Ish Ki Navi Hu" - if her husband was not a Navi, would Avimelech be allowed to keep her?!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "Hashev Eshes ha'Ish", in any case;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding your claim to be a Tzadik (because Avraham said 'she is my sister'), "Ki Navi Hu" - Avraham learned from your people that it would be dangerous to say that she is his wife!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>When a traveler comes to a city, people should ask him if he needs food or drink, and not about the status of the woman with him!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>This teaches that a Nochri is (responsible and is) killed for not having learned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>EXEMPTIONS FROM GALUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> A Suma (blind person) is not exiled;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, he is exiled</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A Sonei (the murderer hated the victim) is not exiled;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi says, he is killed, because it is as if he was warned;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon says, sometimes he is killed, and sometimes not:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we can say that he killed intentionally, he is killed. If he killed unintentionally, he is exiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "B'Lo Re'os" excludes a Suma;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Meir says, "b'Lo Re'os" includes a Suma.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Asher Yavo Es Re'ehu va'Ya'ar" includes a Suma, so "b'Lo Re'os" excludes him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir agrees, but he says that "bi'Vli Da'as" also excludes him. Two exclusions, one after the other, always come to include.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah holds that "bi'Vli Da'as" excludes one who intended.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> A Sonei is killed...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He was not warned!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, who says that a Chaver need not be warned, for warning is only to distinguish whether one is Shogeg or Mezid. (Similarly, we may assume that a Sonei was Mezid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Sometimes a Sonei is exiled...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> When does R. Shimon say that a Sonei is exiled? If the rope broke, he is exiled. If it slipped, he is not exiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2 - R. Shimon):</span> He is exiled only if the Ma'agilah slipped from his hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This Beraisos argue about the rope breaking (Beraisa #1 obligates Galus, and Beraisa #2 exempts) and about slipping (Beraisa #1 exempts, and Beraisa #2 obligates)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> We can resolve breaking. Beraisa #1 discusses a Sonei, and Beraisa #2 discusses a friend;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> We can resolve slipping. Beraisa #1 is like Rebbi (who exempts when the axe-blade slipped off), and Beraisa #2 is like Chachamim (who are Mechayev).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE AREI MIKLAT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Galus is in one of the Arei Miklat (refuge cities). There were three in Ever ha'Yarden, and three in Eretz Kena'an - "Es Shelosh he'Arim Titnu me'Ever la'Yarden v'Es Shelosh... b'Eretz Kena'an."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Until those in Eretz Kena'an were chosen, those in Ever ha'Yarden were not Kolet (absorb, i.e. to forbidden killing the murderer there, and to forbid him to leave before the Kohen Gadol dies). "Shesh Arei Miklat Tihyenah" teaches that if all six are not Kolet, none are.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We prepare roads between the cities and space them evenly - "Tachin Lecha ha'Derech v'Shilashta Es Gevul Artzecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We send two Chachamim with a murderer on his way to the Ir Miklat. They speak to the Go'el ha'Dam, lest he kill him on the way;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir says "Zeh Davar ha'Rotze'ach" - the murderer speaks for himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, at first, whether he killed b'Shogeg or b'Mezid, he goes to an Ir Miklat. Beis Din sends for him to come to trial:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the verdict is that he is Chayav Misah, they kill him. If not, they exempt him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he is Chayav Galus, they return him to his Ir Miklat - "v'Heshivo Oso ha'Edah El Ir Miklato..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Moshe separated three cities in Ever ha'Yarden. Yehoshua separated three opposite (i.e. due west of) them in Eretz Kena'an, like two rows of vines in a vineyard;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chevron in Yehudah was opposite Betzer in Midbar. Shechem in Har Efrayim was opposite Ramos in Gil'ad. Kadesh in Har Nafoli was opposite Golan in Bashan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"V'Shilashta" teaches that they must be evenly spaced. The following distances were the same:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>From the south (of Eretz Yisrael) to Chevron, from Chevron to Shechem, from Shechem to Kadesh, and from Kadesh to the north (of Eretz Yisrael).</p>
