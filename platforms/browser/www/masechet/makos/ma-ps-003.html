<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EDIM ZOMEMIM IS A <i>KENAS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is just like Rabah answered, that they pay even though they did not accomplish anything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, it should say that Rav Nachman gave the same support that Rabah did.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>AN ED ZOMEM PAYS ACCORDING TO HIS SHARE.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> An Ed Zomem pays according to his share.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Each witness pays half of what he tried to make the Nidon pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Mishnah explicitly teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Edim Zomemim divide among themselves the payment of money they tried to make the Nidon pay. They do not divide lashes (each is lashed the full amount they tried to inflict).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If one of the witnesses was Huzam, he pays half of what he tried to make the Nidon pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> An Ed Zomem does not pay unless both witnesses are Huzmu.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The case is, he admits that he testified falsely.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A witness is not believed to retract his testimony!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, he says 'we testified and we were Huzmu in Ploni's Beis Din.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is unlike R. Akiva, who says that an Ed Zomem does not pay based on his own admission! (The Halachah follows R. Akiva.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Rather, he says 'we testified and were Huzmu in Ploni's Beis Din, and they obligated us to pay money.' (Once Beis Din rules that a Kenas must be paid, it is like a regular obligation, and one pays based on his own admission.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since his admission does not obligate the other witness to pay, also he is exempt. Rav Yehudah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FALSE TESTIMONY ABOUT A KESUVAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Edim (who were later found to be) Zomemim testified that Reuven divorced his wife and did not pay her Kesuvah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They need not pay him the full value of her Kesuvah, for he would have eventually paid it anyway (if he divorces her, or if she was widowed she would have collected it from his estate);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, we estimate what one would pay for the chance to collect her Kesuvah (the Tovas Hana'ah):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>She collects if and when she is divorced or widowed. If she dies first, he inherits her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How do we make the estimation? (It cannot be what someone would pay for her rights of collection, this is not what they tried to make Reuven lose!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> We estimate Reuven's Tovas Hana'ah (what one would pay for his rights to keep and use the money and property of the Kesuvah until it must be paid. If she dies first, he keeps it forever.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Noson bar Oshaya):</span> We estimate her Tovas Hana'ah, and deduct this from the total value of the Kesuvah. (If she would agree to sell it, her husband would buy her Tovas Hana'ah to guarantee that he will keep the Kesuvah forever. This is more than his Tovas Hana'ah, for the sum of his and her Tovas Hana'ah is less than the Kesuvah. This is because one would buy such collection rights only for less than the true value based on statistical expectations to collect. One who wants to buy land is loathe to buy her Tovas Hana'ah, for he has no idea when (if at all) he will receive it. People are reluctant to buy his Tovas Hana'ah, for they fear to invest in the land, lest she collect it suddenly. Also, perhaps they suspect that he sells because he has thoughts of divorcing her - <b>PF</b>.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> We deduct her Tovas Hana'ah from the Kesuvah. They do not pay for Nichsei Melug (property that she brings into the marriage, and receives it back with her Kesuvah, without compensation if its value rose or declined. This is because they can say that they did not know about it.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH LOANS ARE CANCELLED IN SHEMITAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If witnesses testified that Reuven must pay to Shimon 1000 Zuz in 30 days, and Reuven says that he has 10 years to pay, and they were Huzam, we estimate the difference of what one would pay for rights to have 1000 Zuz for 30 days, or for 10 years. (They tried to make Reuven lose this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> Shemitah (the seventh year) is Meshamet (cancels) a loan of 10 years;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though "Lo Yigos (do not request payment)" does not apply in Shemitah (since the loan is not due yet), since it will apply later, Shemitah is Meshamet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana - Mishnah):</span> We estimate the difference of what someone would pay for his rights to have 1000 Zuz for 30 days, or for 10 years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the loan is cancelled, Reuven need not repay after 10 years!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, Shimon took a security when he lent him, or he handed over his documents to Beis Din (authorized Beis Din to collect for him, e.g. Pruzbul);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one takes a security when he lends, or he hands over his documents to Beis Din, the loan is not cancelled in Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> Shemitah is not Meshamet a loan of 10 years;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though "Lo Yigos" will apply later, since it does not apply in Shemitah, Shemitah is not Meshamet.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> The case is, Shimon took a security when he lent him, or handed over his documents to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one lent 'on condition that Shemitah will not be Meshamet the loan', Shemitah is Meshamet;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He holds that this is a stipulation contrary to Torah, and such stipulations are void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere, he holds that such stipulations are valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one sells 'on condition that you have no (claim of) Ona'ah (overcharging) against me', the buyer has (a claim of) Ona'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He has no Ona'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Anan said that Shmuel explained that if he said 'on condition that <i>you</i> have no Ona'ah against me', (he stipulates that the buyer pardon the Ona'ah, therefore) the stipulation is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'on condition that <i>there is no Ona'ah</i> in the sale' (Rashi - he promises that he is not overcharging; Tosfos - he stipulates that the law of Ona'ah will not apply), Shmuel agrees that this is a stipulation contrary to Torah, so it is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Likewise, if he lent 'on condition that <i>you</i> will not Meshamet the loan in Shemitah' (he asks him to waive his right), Shemitah is not Meshamet;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he lent 'on condition that <i>Shemitah</i> will not Meshamet', Shemitah is Meshamet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one lends without setting a date (for payment), he may not demand payment until 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This is only if he wrote a document, for people do not bother to write a document for less than 30 days, but one may demand a Milveh Al Peh (a loan without a document) immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> No. Whether or not he wrote a document, he must wait 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>A Beraisa says exactly like Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel):</span> What is the source that if one lends without setting a date, he may not demand payment until 30 days, whether or not he wrote a document?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Masnah) Question:</span> Why does it say "Shenas ha'Sheva Shenas ha'Shmitah"? We already know that the seventh year is Shemitah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse alludes to another Shemitah (period when one may not demand payment), i.e. if one lends without setting a date. He may not demand payment until 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Thirty days are considered like a year (<i>Shenas</i> ha'Shmitah).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>OTHER QUESTIONS OF RAV KAHANA AGAINST RAV YEHUDAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one makes a neckhole in a garment on Shabbos, he is liable (for finishing a vessel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> Why is this different than cutting off a lid plastered onto a barrel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The neckhole was part of the garment itself. The lid was merely stuck on the barrel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> (If three Lugim (a Lug is about a half liter) of Mayim She'uvim, i.e. water that was in a vessel, falls into an incomplete Mikveh, the Mikveh is Pasul even after it has a full Shi'ur.) If a Kortov (a 64th of a Lug) of wine fell into three Lugim of Mayim She'uvim and gave it the appearance of wine, it (is considered like wine, so it) does not disqualify a Mikveh (if it fell in).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> Why is it different than dye water?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> If three Lugim of dye water fell into a Mikveh, they disqualify it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Since it is called dye <i>water</i>, the law of Mayim She'uvim applies. In Rav Yehudah's case, it is called mixed (diluted) wine, so the law of Mayim She'uvim does not apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya's Beraisa):</span> A case (like Rav discusses) occurred, and they disqualified the Mikveh.</p>
