<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SHARING THE PAYMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Edim Zomemim divide among themselves the payment of money that they tried to make the Nidon pay. They do not divide lashes:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they testified that Ploni must pay 200 Zuz, all together the witnesses pay 200;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they testified that Ploni must receive 40 lashes, each receives 40 lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Rasha- Rasha" from Chayavei Misos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like half-Misah is not (possible to be) given, half-sets of lashes are not given.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> If the lashes would be divided, this is not "Ka'asher Zamam La'asos l'Achiv."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also when money is divided, this is not "Ka'asher Zamam"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Money joins (Ploni receives what they sought to make him lose), but lashes do not join.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IN WHAT CASES DO WITNESSES BECOME ZOMEMIM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Edim become Zomemim only if the Mezimim contradict what the first ones implicitly said about themselves (i.e. that they were at the scene of what they testified about).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If two witnesses testified that Ploni killed Shimon, and other witnesses (David and Moshe) say 'that is impossible. That day, Ploni (or Shimon) was with us somewhere else!', the first witnesses are not Zomemim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if David and Moshe say 'How can you testify about this? That day, you were with us in a different place', the first witnesses are Zomemim. They are killed based on the testimony of David and Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If more witnesses testified, and they were Huzam, and more witnesses testified, and they were Huzam, all the Zomemim are killed; (Rashi - each new pair testified about Ploni, and David and Moshe were Mezim them. R. Chananel - the third pair was Mezim David and Moshe, the fourth pair was Mezim the third... The last pair to testify is believed, and also the pairs 2, 4, 6... before them. The pair before the last are Zomemim, and also the pairs 3, 5, 7... before the last. They are killed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, this is a conspiracy (to be Mezim anyone who will testify)! Only the first witnesses are killed (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of the first law of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ada):</span> "V'Hinei Ed Sheker ha'Ed Sheker Onah" - they must establish the witnesses themselves to be false (i.e. what they implicitly said about themselves).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "La'anos Bo <i>Sarah</i>" - the witnesses themselves must be Husru (removed, i.e. we learn that they were not there).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If two witnesses said 'Ploni killed someone to the east of the building', and others said '(at that time,) you were with us to the west of the building', we check;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If someone to the west can see what is happening to the east, they are not Zomemim. If not, they are Zomemim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we suspect that the witnesses have better eyesight than normal people. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If two witnesses said 'Sunday morning in Sura, Ploni killed someone', and others said 'Sunday afternoon, you were with us in Neharde'a', we check:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If someone can travel from Sura to Neharde'a in that amount of time, they are not Zomemim. If not, they are Zomemim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we suspect that the witnesses found camels that run much faster than normal. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If two witnesses said 'on Sunday, Ploni killed someone (in a certain place)', and others said 'on Sunday, you were with us elsewhere. On Monday, he killed someone', the first two (and Ploni) are killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if they said that Ploni had killed on Erev Shabbos, the first witnesses are killed, because at the time the first ones testified about Ploni, he was not yet sentenced to die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learn this from a Mishnah (6b, about two Kitos (pairs of witnesses who testified about a murder, and one of them was Huzam);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Therefore (when they are considered two Kitos (sets of witnesses), if one Kat was Huzam, they and the murderer are killed, the other Kat is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Rava's Chidush was the continuation of his words, which we do not learn from the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The law is different regarding the final verdict:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If two witnesses said (on Tuesday) 'on Sunday, Ploni was sentenced to die (in a certain Beis Din)', and others said 'on Sunday, you were with us elsewhere. On Erev Shabbos he was sentenced', the first two are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even if they said that Ploni was sentenced on Monday, the first witnesses are exempt, because at the time they testified, Ploni was already sentenced to die, so he was (according to Halachah) dead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>The same applies to paying a Kenas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If two witnesses said 'on Sunday, Ploni stole (flock or cattle) and slaughtered or sold (for which he pays a Kenas of three or four times the value (in addition to the principal (the value of the stolen animal, which is not a Kenas))', and others said 'on Sunday, you were with us elsewhere. On Monday, he stole and slaughtered or sold', the first two pay the fine (to Ploni, and he pays the full four or five);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even if they said that Ploni had stolen and slaughtered or sold on Erev Shabbos, the first witnesses pay the fine, because at the time they testified about Ploni, he was not yet obligated to pay the fine (perhaps he would have admitted, and been exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If two witnesses said (on Tuesday) 'on Sunday, a certain Beis Din obligated Ploni to pay Kenas (four or five, because he stole and slaughtered or sold)', and others said 'On Sunday, you were with us elsewhere; on Erev Shabbos, Beis Din obligated him to pay Kenas', the first two are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Even if they said that Beis Din obligated Ploni on Monday, the first witnesses are exempt, because at the time they testified about Ploni, he was already obligated to pay the Kenas.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN ARE WITNESSES HUCHZEKU TO BE LIARS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> This is a conspiracy...</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is a conspiracy, also the first witnesses should not be killed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu):</span> The case is, the first witnesses were already killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so (the Mishnah does not teach that they <i>should</i> be killed,) why does it mention that they were killed? (Obviously we kill Edim Zomemim if we do not know that witnesses wil later be MEzim the Mezimim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah teaches, if there was only one Kat (that testified and was Huzam), the Kat is killed. If there are more than one Kat, they are not killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says '<i>only</i> the first Kat is killed!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This is left difficult</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>A woman brought witnesses, and they were found to be liars. She brought more witnesses, and they were found to be liars. She brought more witnesses, and they were not found to be liars.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> She is Muchzekes to bring false witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> Even if she is Muchzekes to (try to) bring false witnesses, Yisraelim are not Muchzakim to agree to lie.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A similar case occurred when R. Yochanan was there. Reish Lakish said like he did above, and R. Yochanan said like R. Elazar had said.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reish Lakish was angry at R. Elazar. 'You heard the law from R. Yochanan. Why didn't you say it in his name?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Reish Lakish holds like R. Yehudah, and R. Yochanan holds like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Reish Lakish can hold even like Chachamim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim believe the Mezimim because we do not see someone bringing them to Beis Din to Mezim the witnesses, but here she is bringing false witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> R. Yochanan can even hold like R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah does not believe the Mezimim because it is unreasonable that everyone who comes to testify was with them. Here, perhaps the first witnesses did not see the testimony, but the latter ones did!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN ARE EDIM ZOMEMIM KILLED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Edim Zomemim are killed only if there was a final verdict to kill the defendant;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Tzedukim say, they are not killed unless the Nidon was killed, for it says "Nefesh Tachas Nafesh";</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer - Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Edim Zomemim are liable once they testified!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R.

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THREE WITNESSES ARE LIKE TWO</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> "Al Pi Shnayim Edim Oh Sheloshah Edim Yumas ha'Mes" - if the testimony of two witnesses is valid, and all the more so testimony of three witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Torah equates the testimony of two witnesses with that of three witnesses:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like three witnesses can be Mezim two, also two witnesses can be Mezim three.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that two can be Mezim even 100?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Edim". (This is extra, to teach that two can be Mezim four. Since they can be Mezim two pairs of witnesses, they can be Mezim even 100.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Shimon):</span> Just like two witnesses are not killed unless both are Huzmu, also three are not killed unless all are Huzmu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that this applies even to 100?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Edim".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Akiva):</span> The Torah did not mention a third witness to teach a leniency, rather, to be stringent. It equates his law to the first two (he is also killed):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Even though the testimony of the first two sufficed to kill the Nidon without him,) for joining the wicked he is punished like the wicked themselves;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All the more so, the Torah will reward those who join people doing a Mitzvah like those who did the Mitzvah (because Hash-m's Midah to reward is much greater than His Midah to punish).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Akiva):</span> Regarding two witnesses, if one of them was found to be a relative (to a party in the case or the other witness) or Pasul (invalid witness), the remaining testimony is invalid. Likewise, if one of three witnesses (of a Kat) was found to be a relative or Pasul, the remaining testimony is invalid.</p>
