<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DISAGREEMENT ABOUT KIDUSHIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven says to Leah 'I was Mekadesh you', and she denies it, he is forbidden to marry her relatives, and she is permitted to his relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she says 'you were Mekadesh me', and he denies it, she is forbidden to his relatives, and he is permitted to hers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he tells Leah 'I was Mekadesh you', and she says 'no, you were Mekadesh my daughter (Dinah)', he is forbidden to marry Leah's relatives, and permitted to Dinah's. Leah and Dinah are permitted to his relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he says 'I was Mekadesh your daughter', and Leah says 'no, you were Mekadesh me', he is forbidden to Dinah's relatives, and permitted to Leah's. Leah is forbidden to his relatives, Dinah is permitted to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> It was not enough to teach the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had the Mishnah taught only when he claims that he was Mekadesh her (that she is permitted to his relatives), one might have thought that this is because a man can speak freely (he can always marry other women);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A woman who says that he was Mekadesh her forbids herself to all other men. One might have thought that surely it is true, and he is forbidden to her relatives. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the next case (...she says 'no, you were Mekadesh my daughter'...) needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that just like mid'Oraisa a father is believed about Kidushin of his daughter, mid'Rabanan a mother is believed. This clause teaches that a mother is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the Seifa (he says 'I was Mekadesh your daughter'...) needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was taught merely for parallel structure.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MUST HE DIVORCE HER?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We force (him to divorce her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We request.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which case do they discuss?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They discuss the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> She does not need a Get from him! (There is no reason to force or request.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They discuss the second case ('you were Mekadesh me').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, we may request him to give a Get. Why would Rav say that we force him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(If he divorces her, we consider him to be her ex-husband.) He can say that he does not want to become forbidden to her relatives!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They do not argue. Rav completes Shmuel's words;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel said that we request that he give a Get. Rav remarked that if he gives a Get on his own, we force him to pay a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Acha bar Rav Ada bar Ahavah, citing Rav):</span> We force and request.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is a contradiction!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We request that he give a Get. If he gives a Get on his own, we force him to pay a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>KIDUSHIN IN FRONT OF ONE WITNESS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one was Mekadesh in front of one witness, we ignore it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If both of them agree that he was Mekadesh her, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Yehudah could not give a clear answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> We ignore Kidushin in front of one witness, even if both agree that he was Mekadesh her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven says to Leah 'I was Mekadesh you', and she denies it, he is forbidden to her relatives, and she is permitted to his.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If witnesses saw the Kidushin, she should be forbidden to his relatives!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If no witnesses saw the Kidushin, he should be permitted to her relatives!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, one witness saw the Kidushin (and he is forbidden to her relatives)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. He claims that he was Mekadesh her in front of two witnesses, and they went abroad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If a man divorced his wife, and they spent the night in the same room in an inn, she does not need another Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel say, she needs another Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If no witnesses saw the Kidushin, why do Beis Hillel require another Get?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If two witnesses saw the Kidushin, why don't Beis Shamai require another Get?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, one witness saw the Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Reisha):</span> Beis Hillel admit that if she was divorced from Kidushin (before Nisu'in), no other Get is required, for he is not intimate with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Kidushin in front of one witness is valid, it makes no difference whether she was divorced from Kidushin or Nisu'in!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, there are two witnesses about seclusion, but no witnesses about Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai hold that we do not say that they surely had Bi'ah (and the witnesses about seclusion are considered witnesses about Bi'ah);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">65b----------------------------------------65b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel hold that they surely had Bi'ah. Witnesses about seclusion are witnesses about Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Beis Hillel admit that if she was divorced from Kidushin, they are not witnesses about Bi'ah, for he is not intimate with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yitzchak bar Shmuel bar Marsa):</span> We ignore Kidushin in front of one witness, even if both agree that he was Mekadesh her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> The great Beis Din says that we ignore Kidushin in front of one witness, even if both agree that he was Mekadesh her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the great Beis Din?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rabah bar Rav Huna said this in Rav's name. The great Beis Din is Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HOW MANY WITNESSES ARE NEEDED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achdevoy bar R. Ami - Beraisa):</span> Two men and a woman came from abroad; there is a package among them. Each man claims 'the other man is my slave, the woman is my wife, and the package is mine.' She claims 'they are both my slaves, and the package is mine.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The law is, she needs a Get from each man, and she collects a Kesuvah from the package.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If each man has witnesses that she is Mekudeshes to him, she could not claim that they are her slaves and the package is hers!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, each has one witness that he was Mekadesh her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> One witness who is contradicted (by another witness or the defendant) is not believed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, all agree that she does not need a Get to get married;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>She needs a Get from each man in order to collect a Kesuvah from the package.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The Beraisa is like R. Meir, who says that the lien to collect a Kesuvah is on Metaltelim, as well as on land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the final ruling about Kidushin in front of one witness?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> We are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> We are concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi to Rav Kahana):</span> Do you learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Davar-Davar" from monetary cases? If so, just like there, a person's admission is believed absolutely like 100 witnesses, also regarding Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> No. Regarding monetary cases, a person's admission is believed absolutely because it does not harm anyone else;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One's admission about Kidushin harms others (it forbids her to other men). He is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Mar Zutra and Rav Ada Sava were brothers. They divided up their property without witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra and Rav Ada Sava):</span> Does "according to two witnesses a matter will be established" refer to when the parties want to retract? If so, since we do not want to retract, our division stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, does the verse teach that transactions do not take effect without witnesses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Witnesses are needed only for (disproving) liars. Transactions work without witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHEN IS ONE WITNESS BELIEVED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'you ate Chelev' and Shimon was silent, Reuven is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'you ate Chelev' and Shimon said, 'I did not eat', Shimon is exempt (from a Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had Shimon not contradicted him, Reuven would have been believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'your food became Tamei' and Shimon was silent, Reuven is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'you became Tamei' and Shimon said 'I did not', Shimon is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had Shimon not contradicted him, Reuven would have been believed.</p>
