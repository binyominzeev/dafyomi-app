<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES A HUSBAND GET ALL THAT HIS WIFE ACQUIRES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Elsewhere, the opinions of R. Meir and Chachamim are reversed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A woman who redeems Ma'aser Sheni must always add a fifth of the value;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir says, she can redeem it without adding a fifth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> She redeems her husband's Ma'aser with his money.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, she is his Shali'ach. All would agree that she adds a fifth!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, she redeems his (Rashi; Tosfos - her) Ma'aser with her money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, all would agree that she does not add a fifth - "a man (will add a fifth)", not his wife (Rashi; Tosfos - not a woman)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, someone gave her money and said 'acquire this money only in order to redeem the Ma'aser';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(R. Meir says that the Tenai works, therefore, she does not add a fifth. Chachamim say that the money belongs to her husband. She is just his Shali'ach, so she adds a fifth.) This is the opposite of their opinions about a slave!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The text is wrong. Their opinions must be switched (in the Beraisa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The text is correct. The case is, she inherited the Ma'aser from her father (and redeemed it with her husband's money);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir holds that Ma'aser Sheni is like Hekdesh (it is not one's property. The owner merely is allowed to eat it.) Therefore, her husband does not acquire it. (No fifth is added, since he does not redeem his Ma'aser.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that one owns his Ma'aser Sheni. Her husband acquires it (like any property that his wife inherits);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A fifth is added, since she is his Shali'ach to redeem his Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FOR WHICH LIMBS DOES A SLAVE GO FREE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (If the master knocks out) an eye, tooth or extremal limb (that does not grow back) of his slave, he goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, the Torah explicitly says that he goes free for an eye or tooth. What is the source for the other extremal limbs?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from an eye and tooth. Just like these are exposed blemishes that will not grow back, the same applies to all such blemishes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that "eye" and "tooth" are Shnei Kesuvim (two verses that teach the same principle, one of which could have been learned from the other verse). We do not learn other cases from Shnei Kesuvim! (If we could learn from them, there would be no need for both of them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It needed to write "eye" and "tooth." We could not learn either from the other:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had the Torah written only "tooth", one might have thought that even baby teeth are included. Therefore, it wrote "eye" (to teach that one goes free only for limbs that do not grow replacements).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had the Torah written only "eye", one might have thought that only things that one is born with are included, but not teeth. Therefore, it wrote "tooth".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that "if he will hit" is a Klal, and "tooth or eye" is a Prat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From a Klal u'Frat, we only learn the Prat a tooth or eye!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "He will send him free" is a Klal. From a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal, we learn everything similar to the Peratim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A tooth or eye that is knocked out is a visible blemish that will not heal. We include all such damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Peratim are visible blemishes that will not heal in which the limb ceases to perform its function. We should include only such cases. Why does a Beraisa teach otherwise?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the master pulled the slave's beard and dislocated the bone, the slave goes free (even though the bone has no use)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, "he will send him free" is a Ribuy (we expound through the method of Ribuyim and Mi'utim, and include (almost) everything).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the slave should go free even if he was hit on the hand and it dried up, even if it will heal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (In such a case) the slave does not go free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mi'utim "eye" and "tooth" exclude this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon, R. Eliezer, R. Akiva):</span> For any of the blows that free the slave, a Get of freedom is needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Meir and R. Tarfon say, a Get is not needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>The arbitrators say, a Get is not needed when he strikes an eye or tooth, because the Torah said that he goes free;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Get is needed if a different limb is stricken, since this is a fine of Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It is mid'Oraisa. It was expounded from verses!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, a Get is needed since it is (not explicit, rather) expounded by Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for those who require a Get?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Shilu'ach-Shilu'ach" from divorce. Just like a document is needed there, also here;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The others say that the Torah did not write 'he will send him free', rather "free, he will send him" to teach that he is free immediately (without a Get. Riva - the arbitrators say that this Derashah applies only to an eye or tooth. For other limbs, we learn from divorce that a Get is required. R. Tam - the Get is mid'Rabanan, lest people believe that he is still a slave.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FOR WHICH DAMAGE TO THE LIMB DOES HE GO FREE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the master hit him on the eye and blinded it, or on the ear and deafened it, he goes free;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he hit (a wall) near the organ and it ceased functioning (from fright), he does not go free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference (R. Shemen):</span> One is exempt for damage caused through noise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rami bar Yechezkel taught that if Reuven's chicken cackled inside a jar and the sound broke it, Reuven must pay the full damage. (This is like Sumchus, who obligates full damage for Tzeroros, i.e. when an animal damaged through an intermediary.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If a horse or donkey whinnied and broke Kelim, the owner pays half damage. (This is like Chachamim, who obligate half damage for Tzeroros.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It is different when a person was damaged. He caused the damage to himself (by his fright).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven scared Shimon, Beis Din cannot make him pay, but he is accountable b'Yedei Shamayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was Toke'a (blew a Shofar in, or hit him near) his ear and deafened him, he is exempt. If he was holding him when he did this, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If a master hit his slave's eye and weakened it, or his tooth and loosened it, if the limb no longer works, the slave goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If a master hit his slave's weak eye and blinded it, or his loose tooth and knocked it out, if the limb was usable until now, the slave goes free. If not, he does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>It was necessary to teach both cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had we learned only the first case, we would think that he goes free only when a healthy limb was damaged, but not if the limb was already impaired;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had we learned only the second case, we would think that he goes free only when a limb was rendered totally useless.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a slave asked his master (a doctor) to paint his eye or dig around his tooth, and in doing so, he blinded the eye or knocked out the tooth, the slave goes free;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, "and he will destroy" - he is only free if the master intended for destruction.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Chachamim learn R. Eliezer's law from this verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If a master stuck his hand into his Shifchah's womb and blinded her fetus, he is exempt, for he did not intend to harm it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel agrees that the master must intend for the limb that was stricken, since the Torah added "and he will destroy it".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim do not expound "it".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> If a master knocked out an eye that was already blind, the slave goes free, because he caused the slave to be lacking a limb.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Animal Korbanos must be unblemished and (in some cases) male. There are no such restrictions regarding bird offerings;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a bird is acceptable even if its wings dried, its leg was cut off, or its eye was gouged out!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "From the birds" teaches that not all birds are acceptable. (This shows that a missing eye is worse than a blinded eye.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> If a master knocked out an extra finger, the slave goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This applies only if it was in line with the other fingers. (Rashi (Bechoros) - in this case it is considered a limb. However, it seems that the Rambam disagrees - Kesef Mishneh Hilchos Bi'as Makdish 8:11.)</p>
