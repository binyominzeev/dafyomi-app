<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>UNSPOKEN INTENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rava's source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> "He will offer it" teaches that Beis Din forces one to bring an Olah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we force him against his will.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "willingly"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> We force him until he says that he wants to bring it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this valid? In his heart he does not want!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows that thoughts in the heart are ignored.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps that case is different. Surely, he wants to bring the Korban to get atonement!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> The same applies to Gitin of divorce and freedom. We force the husband or master until he says 'I want to give it'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He was forced. He does not really want!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows that thoughts in the heart are ignored.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps there is different, for it is a Mitzvah to obey Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> If one was Mekadesh a woman, and later said 'I thought that she was a Bas Kohen', and she is really a Bas Levi (or vice-versa), or 'I thought that she was poor', and she is rich (or vice-versa), she is Mekudeshes, because she did not trick him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He erred! He did not want to be Mekadesh such a woman!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows that thoughts in the heart have no bearing in law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> Perhaps the Mishnah teaches only that we are stringent to consider her (Safek) Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> In all these cases, even if she says 'I intended to be Mekudeshes to him even if it was false', she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> She says that she wanted to be Mekudeshes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows that thoughts in the heart have no bearing in law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, he stipulated. Perhaps thoughts in the heart cannot uproot a stipulation, but normally, they have bearing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> A case occurred, and Rav Huna resolved the question from the following Mishnah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'bring to me from the window or from the bag' (and Shimon brought him Hekdesh), even if Reuven says that he intended for a different window or bag, Reuven transgressed Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reuven says that he didn't want from that window or bag!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows that thoughts in the heart have no bearing in law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we suspect that Reuven lies (to avoid bringing a Korban), but if he really did not intend, he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If so, he should have said that he was Mezid (he intended to use the Hekdesh. This would certainly exempt him!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> One does not want to say that he intentionally sinned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, if he was trying to avoid the Korban, he should have said that he remembered that it was Hekdesh (after he appointed Shimon to bring it).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the Meshale'ach remembered, but the Shali'ach did not, the Shali'ach transgressed Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>A man sold his property with intention to ascend to Eretz Yisrael. He went, but was unable to settle there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> Anyone who goes intends to settle. Since he was not able, the sale is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> He stipulated that he was going to Eretz Yisrael. He fulfilled this! (The sale stands.) (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>A man sold his property with intention to ascend to Eretz Yisrael. He never went.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> He could have gone if he wanted. (The sale stands.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Nothing stopped him from going! (The sale stands.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the two versions?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There were problems (surmountable, with difficulty) on the way. (According to Version #1, the sale stands. According to Version #2, it is void.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS ONE INSISTENT ABOUT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one told Levi 'go be Mekadesh Leah to me, in Ploni (a place)', and Levi was Mekadesh her somewhere else, she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'go be Mekadesh Leah to me. She is in Ploni', and Levi was Mekadesh her somewhere else, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> If one said 'give this Get to my wife, in Ploni', and he gave it to her elsewhere, the Get is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he said 'give this Get to my wife. She is in Ploni', and he gave it elsewhere, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>It is necessary to teach both Mishnayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If only Kidushin was taught, one might have thought that since he draws close to her, he is insistent to be Mekadesh her in a place where he is popular and people will speak nicely about him, but regarding divorce, he separates from her, and does not care what people will say about him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If only divorce was taught, one might have thought that since this is shameful, he is insistent where the divorce take place, but he would not care where Kidushin was done.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Both Mishnayos were taught, to teach that he is insistent in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Mekadesh a woman on condition that she is not bound by any vows, and he found that she has vows, she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If he made Nisu'in with her Stam (without stipulating again), and found that she has vows, she does not receive a Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If one was Mekadesh 'on condition that she has no blemishes', and she was found to have blemishes, she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If he made Nisu'in with her Stam, and found blemishes on her, she does not receive a Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Any blemish that disqualifies a Kohen, it disqualifies (Kidushin with) a woman. (It is a Safek if this is only if he stipulated about blemishes, or even if he did not stipulate.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> This Mishnah is also taught in Maseches Kesuvos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, the Tana teaches about Kidushin. By the way, he teaches about the Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>There, the Tana teaches about Kesuvos. By the way, he teaches about Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SAVLONOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Mekadesh two women with one Perutah, or one woman with a half-Perutah,  even if he later sent Savlonos (gifts sent to one's Arusah), she is not Mekudeshes, because he thought that she was already Mekudeshes (and did not intend to be Mekadesh her with the Savlonos);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">50b----------------------------------------50b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The same applies to a minor who was Mekadesh a woman (and sent Savlonos after he grew up).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> It is necessary to teach all three cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only the first case, we would think that people err and think the Kidushin was valid, since he gave a Perutah, which is considered money;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But we would think that all know that less than a Perutah cannot be Mekadesh, and in the second case, he sent Savlonos to be Mekadesh her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only these two cases, we would think, people are not so exacting about the difference between a Perutah and less than a Perutah (so they err);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But we would think that all know that a minor cannot be Mekadesh, and in the third case, he sent for Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so (in every case, he errs, and thinks that she is already his wife).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna and Rabah):</span> We are concerned for Savlonos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (Rabah, against himself - Mishnah):</span> Even if he later sent Savlonos, she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah gives the reason. He thought that she was already Mekudeshes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rabah):</span> We learn our law from the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (She is not Mekudeshes) because he thought that she was already Mekudeshes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If not for the mistake, she would be Mekudeshes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> This is no support. The Mishnah teaches a bigger Chidush.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In a normal case, when a man never expressed intent to be Mekadesh, surely we are not concerned for Savlonos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In our Mishnah, he intended to be Mekadesh. One might have thought that we are concerned for Savlonos. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the final decision?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> In an area where people are Mekadesh and later send Savlonos, we are concerned (lest he already was Mekadesh her).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In an area where people are Mekadesh after sending Savlonos, we are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Question:</span> This (latter law) is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a minority who are Mekadesh and later send Savlonos. One might have thought that we are concerned for the minority. Rav Papa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Chananel, in Tosfos) Question:</span> The first law is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The majority send Savlonos before Kidushin. Only a minority are Mekadesh first. One might have thought that we are not concerned for the minority. Rav Papa teaches that this is not so. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Rav Huna):</span> If people saw that a Kesuvah was written, are we concerned that she is Mekudeshes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> (No!) Will we forbid a woman just because a Kesuvah was written?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the final ruling?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> In an area where people write the Kesuvah after Kidushin, we are concerned. In an area where people write it before Kidushin, we are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first law is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, scribes are hard to find. One might have thought that since he found a scribe, he seized the opportunity (even before Kidushin). Rav Ashi teaches that we do not rely on this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>TWO THINGS THAT HAPPEN AT ONCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Mekadesh simultaneously a woman and her daughter, or two sisters, they are not Mekudashos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A case occurred with five women, two of whom were sisters. A man collected a basket of figs from their field in Shemitah, and said 'you are all Mekudashos to me with these figs.' One of the women took them on behalf of all of them. Chachamim ruled that the sisters are not Mekudashos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> "Do not take a woman in addition to her sister to be a rival" teaches that if the Kidushin would make them rivals to each other, neither is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If so, how do you understand "the souls who do so will get Kares"? If neither is Mekudeshes, no one is Chayav Kares!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, the verse discusses when one received Kidushin after her sister. The reason for the Mishnah is like Rabah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If either of two things cannot take effect after the other, and they were done simultaneously, neither takes effect.</p>
