<p class="dedicationbox">KIDUSHIN 13 - Dedicated by Rabbi Dr. Eli Turkel of Ra'anana, Israel, in memory of his grandparents, Reb Shlomo ben Eliezer Lipa ha'Levi Turkel (whose Yahrzeit is on 21 Tishrei, Hoshana Raba) and Rachel Turkel. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED ACCEPTANCE OF KIDUSHIN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Chachamim of Fum Nahara, citing Rav Huna Brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> The Beraisa is different than our case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Beraisa, she took the money for a deposit. Since she is responsible for it, she is afraid to throw it back;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In our case, the money was given for Kidushin. If she does not want to be Mekudeshes, she should throw it back!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Achai):</span> This question is ill-founded. Not all women know the Halachah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Perhaps she thinks that even regarding Kidushin, if she throws the money and it is lost, she is responsible!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Rav):</span> What is the law in such a case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> We never heard Rav Huna Brei d'Rav Yehoshua's question, so we rule like Rava (she is not Mekudeshes);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You (in Fum Nahara) heard his question. You must be concerned that perhaps she is Mekudeshes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A woman was selling belts. A man came and stole one; she asked him to return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The man:</span> If I do, will you be Mekudeshes to me?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She took it in silence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> She is not Mekudeshes. She can say 'I merely took what is mine.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa #1):</span> If one was Mekadesh a woman with something that he (openly) robbed, extorted, or (secretly) stole, or he grabbed money from her hand and was Mekadesh her with it, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when he was Meshadech her beforehand (she had agreed to accept Kidushin from him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Shiduchin changes the Halachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #2):</span> If a man told a woman 'take this money that I owe you', and retracted and said 'be Mekudeshes to me with it':</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he retracted at the time he gave it, if she wants, she is Mekudeshes. If she does not want, she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he retracted after he gave it, even if she wants, she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered 'wanting' and 'not wanting'?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Wanting is saying 'yes'. Not wanting is saying 'no'.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (The latter statement) implies that had she not said 'no', but rather was silent, she would be Mekudeshes. If so, the Beraisa should say 'she is Mekudeshes. If she does not want, she is not Mekudeshes'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, wanting is saying 'yes'. Not wanting is being silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she is silent, she is not Mekudeshes, because she can say that she took her property. This contradicts Beraisa #1!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of Answer (i)):</span> In Beraisa #2, there were no Shiduchin. In Beraisa #1, there were Shiduchin.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TEACHINGS OF RAV ASI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>After Rav Asi died, Chachamim gathered to recall his teachings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov citing Rav Asi):</span> Just like a woman is not acquired through less than a Perutah, also land is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan - Beraisa):</span> Even though a woman is not acquired through less than a Perutah, land can be.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yakov):</span> It can be acquired through less than a Perutah through Chalipin (but not via Kinyan Kesef).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may acquire (through Chalipin) with a Kli, even if it is not worth a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Anyone not expert in the laws of divorce and Kidushin should have no involvement with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Unqualified people who rule about them are more harmful than the generation of the flood - "false oaths, murder, theft, v'Ni'uf (illicit Bi'ah) Partzu (multiplied), bloods touched bloods..." (the proof from the verse concludes below).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> What is the source (that Ni'uf refers to sin with a married woman)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Rav Yosef translated, (Partzu means that) they fathered children from others' wives; they added sin to sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion of the proof:</span> The Navi continues "... therefore the land will mourn, desolate of all inhabitants, animals of the field, birds, also fish will die;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is worse than the flood. Then there was no decree against the fish - "everything on the land died."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the desolation comes only for all the Aveiros in the verse!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "The land will mourn due to false oaths" (even one Aveirah causes it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the desolation comes for false oaths by themselves, or for everything else in the verse!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Partzu" is written without a 'Vov' (it is not connected with the other Aveiros).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman brought her Korban Chatas and died, her heirs bring the Olah that goes with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This is only if she designated the Olah when she was alive. If not, they do not bring it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that Shibud (a lien on a person's property to pay his debts) is not mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The heirs bring the Olah even if she never designated it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that Shibud is mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learned this argument of Shmuel and R. Yochanan elsewhere! (Why was it repeated?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> A Milveh Al Peh (a loan without a document) cannot be collected from the borrower's heirs, nor from Meshu'abadim (land that the borrower sold after he borrowed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> It can be collected from the heirs or from Meshu'abadim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is necessary to teach the argument in both cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had we learned only about a loan, one might have thought that Shmuel admits regarding a Korban, since that obligation is written in the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had we learned only about a Korban, one might have thought that R. Yochanan makes the heirs pay only then, because a debt written in the Torah is as if it is written in a document, but regarding a loan, he would agree that the heirs and buyers are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We learn that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The Halachah is, a Milveh Al Peh can be collected from heirs, but not from Meshu'abadim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It can be collected from heirs, because Shibud is mid'Oraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Chachamim enacted that) it can not be collected from Meshu'abadim, since (there is no publicity to such loans and) buyers were unaware.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A WIDOW MAY REMARRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman acquires herself through a Get or death of her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know the source that a Get permits her - "he will write a Sefer of cutting...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the source that a widow may remarry?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from logical reasoning. The husband caused her Isur to other men. Now that he is dead, she is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Regarding Arayos (forbidden relatives, e.g. a step-mother), the Isur remains after the cause of the Isur (the father) dies!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Torah said that if a man dies childless, his widow is forbidden (to all except the Yavam). We infer that if one dies with children, the widow is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps we infer oppositely! If he dies childless, his widow is forbidden to strangers and permitted to the Yavam. If he dies with children, she is forbidden to all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Torah said that a widow is forbidden to a Kohen Gadol. This implies that she is permitted to a regular Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps an Isur Aseh (derived from a positive Mitzvah) forbids her to all, and an extra Lav forbids her to a Kohen Gadol!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we understand such a Chayavei Aseh?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If death of the husband removes the Lav of a married woman (which is punishable by death and Kares), it should also remove the Aseh!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If his death does not remove the Aseh, it should not remove the Lav, either!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It removes only the Lav, like we find regarding Korbanos that became blemished;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Before they are redeemed, one who benefits from them transgresses Me'ilah. It is forbidden to shear them or make them work;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>After they are redeemed, Me'ilah no longer applies, but it is still forbidden to shear them or make them work.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> We learn from "perhaps he will die in war, and Acher (a different man) will take (his wife)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shisha Brei d'Rav Idi):</span> Perhaps the other man referred to is the Yavam!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The Yavam would not be called "Acher".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Ashi):</span> "(Her second husband will divorce her) or die" equates death of her husband to divorce;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like divorce fully permits remarriage, also death of the husband.</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
