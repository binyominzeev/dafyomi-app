<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>KIDUSHIN THROUGH A DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that even a document can make Kidushin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from a Kal va'Chomer: money can make Kidushin, even though it cannot divorce. A document can divorce, all the more so it can make Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Money is a more versatile acquisition than a document. Money can redeem Hekdesh and Ma'aser Sheni, but a document cannot - 'he will give the money, and it (the Hekdesh) will be (permitted, i.e. Chulin) to him';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps money is stronger also regarding Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "She will leave... and she will be (Mekudeshes)" equates divorce and Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a document divorces, it can also be Mekadesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should likewise say that just like money can be Mekadesh, it can divorce!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Torah would not make such a law. People would say, just like money is Mekadesh, it divorces; the advocate has become the prosecutor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A document can be Mekadesh and divorce, and we are not concerned for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Shtar (document of) Kidushin is not the same as a Get of divorce.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also money given for Kidushin need not be the same as money given to divorce.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The coins themselves are the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "He will write for her (a Get)" - a woman is divorced through writing, not through money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the verse rather teaches that she is divorced through writing, but she is not Mekudeshes through writing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "She will leave... and she will be (Mekudeshes)" equates divorce and Kidushin (a document also makes Kidushin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do you say that that a document works for both, and "he will write for her" teaches that she is not divorced through money? We could say that money works for both, and "he will write for her" teaches that a document cannot be Mekadesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah wrote "he will write for her" in the context of divorce. Presumably, it excludes alternate methods of divorce, not methods of Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili learns a different law from "he will write for her" (that a Get may not be written on food or living beings). How does he learn that a woman is not divorced through money?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Sefer Kerisus" teaches that only a Sefer cuts her off.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from that verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that the Get must sever them (without a Tenai (stipulation) tying them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one gave a Get and said 'this is your Get on condition that you will never drink wine', or 'on condition that you will never go to your father's house', she is not divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the Tenai is for a limited duration, she is divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili learns this from the plural form "Kerisus".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim say that the plural form does not warrant expounding an extra law.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CAN WE DERIVE ONE METHOD OF KIDUSHIN FROM THE OTHERS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>We have shown that none of the three methods of Kidushin could have been learned from one of the other two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can one method be learned from the other two?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> We can derive a document from money and Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> She receives great benefit from money and Bi'ah. We cannot learn to a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> We can derive Bi'ah from money and a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Money and documents acquire many things. We cannot learn to Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #3:</span> We can derive money from a document and Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A document and Bi'ah (sometimes) work against her will. We cannot learn to money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Money acquires an Amah against her will (Rashi - through her father's acceptance; Tosfos - the master is Mekadesh her through the money, against her father's will).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We do not find money given for marriage that works against the will of the recipient.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN CHUPAH MAKE KIDUSHIN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that Chupah makes Kidushin:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Money makes Kidushin, even though it never permits (the woman) to eat Terumah. Chupah (with a Kohen) permits a woman to eat Terumah, all the more so it makes Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Money permits a woman to eat Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Mid'Oraisa, a Bas Yisrael Mekudeshes to a Kohen may eat Terumah. "A Kohen who acquires a soul with money (that person may eat Terumah)" - he acquires a wife through money!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim decreed that she does not eat, lest she come to feed Terumah to her siblings in her father's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Rav Huna learns that money makes Kidushin, even though it does not complete the marriage. Chupah completes marriage, all the more so it makes Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Money is a more versatile acquisition than Chupah. Money can redeem Hekdesh and Ma'aser Sheni. Perhaps money is stronger also regarding Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Bi'ah. Bi'ah makes Kidushin, even though Bi'ah does not make other acquisitions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Bi'ah. Bi'ah acquires a Yevamah (whereas Chupah cannot).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see from money that ability to acquire a Yevamah is not essential to make Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Money and Bi'ah have different strengths. The common side is, they acquire in other situations, and make Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also Chupah acquires in other situations (after Kidushin). We derive that also Chupah makes Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from money and Bi'ah, for they give greater benefit to the woman than Chupah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A document proves that giving benefit is not essential to make Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from a document, for a document can divorce!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Money and Bi'ah show that ability to divorce is not essential to make Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Money, Bi'ah, and a document have different strengths. The common side is, they acquire in other situations and make Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also Chupah acquires in other situations. It also should make Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from money, Bi'ah and a document, for all of them sometimes work against the will of the recipient!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> We never find that money makes Kidushin against the will of the recipient.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> There are two difficulties with Rav Huna's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> The Mishnah says that there are (only) three ways to be Mekadesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> We know only that Chupah acquires after Kidushin. How can we learn that Chupah works without prior Kidushin?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Question #1 - Abaye):</span> The Tana listed the three forms of Kidushin explicit in the Torah. There may be others not explicit in the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Question #2 - Abaye):</span> The Kal va'Chomer teaches that Chupah works without prior Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Money cannot complete marriage, yet it makes Kidushin. Chupah completes marriage, all the more so it makes Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>KIDUSHIN THROUGH MONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man gave to a woman money or Shavah Kesef (something worth money) and said 'you are Mekudeshes (sanctified) to me', or 'you are Me'ureses to me', or 'you are like a wife to me', she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she gave (money to him) and said 'I am Mekudeshes to you', 'I am Me'ureses to you', or 'I am like a wife to you', she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> In the Reisha, she is Mekudeshes because he gave the money and said 'you are Mekudeshes...' This implies that had she said these words, she would not be Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Seifa she is not Mekudeshes because she gave the money and said the words. This implies that had he given the money, she would be Mekudeshes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Reisha is precise. The Seifa was not taught for this Diyuk. It was taught only for to parallel structure with the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Tana would not teach something that contradicts the Reisha!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Beraisa teaches that if he gives the money and said the words, clearly she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he gave the money and she said these words, it is as if she gave the money and said the words, and she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Beraisa teaches that if he gave the money and said the words, she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she gave the money and said the words, she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he gave the money and she said the words, it is a Safek. Mid'Rabanan, we are stringent and consider her Safek Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a man gave a woman money or Shavah Kesef, and said 'behold, you are Mekudeshes', or 'behold, you are Me'ureses', or 'behold, you are like a wife', she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'I am your husband', or 'I am your betrothed', she is not even Safek Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Similarly regarding divorce, if one gave his wife a Get and said 'behold, you are sent', or 'behold, you are divorced', or 'behold, you are permitted to any man', she is divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'I am not your husband', or 'I am not your betrothed', she is not even Safek divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Shmuel seems to hold that Yados (incomplete expressions) that are ambiguous are valid Yados (he did not specify to whom he is Mekadesh her, nevertheless she is Mekudeshes to him). If so, he contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man said 'I am', this is acceptance of Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this? Perhaps he meant 'I am in a fast'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The case is, a Nazir passed in front of him when he said this.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If a Nazir was not around, it would not be acceptance of Nezirus (because ambiguous Yados are invalid)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Shmuel (here) discusses one who said '(you are Mekudeshes or divorced) to (or from) me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, obviously she is Mekudeshes or divorced. What is Shmuel's Chidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that the latter expressions (of Kidushin and divorce) are invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Kidushin, it says "when a man will take a woman", not that he will take himself (to be married to her);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding divorce, it says "he will send her", not 'he will send himself from her.'</p>
