<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>YIBUM AND CHALITZAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Yevamah is acquired through Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We learn this from "her Yavam will come upon (have Bi'ah with) her and take her for a wife."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> All methods of acquiring a wife should acquire a Yevamah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps money or a document fully acquires a Yevamah, just like Bi'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "He will do Yibum to her" - only Bi'ah fully acquires her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "he will do Yibum to her" teaches only that Bi'ah acquires her against her will!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah said only "he will do Yibum", we would learn only that only Bi'ah fully acquires her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"To her" teaches that Bi'ah acquires her against her will.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (She acquires herself through) Chalitzah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>We learn from "his name will be called in Yisrael 'the house of the removed shoe'" - once the Yevamah removed his shoe, she is permitted to anyone in Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This verse is used to teach something else!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> "In Yisrael" teaches that the judges on the Beis Din for Chalitzah must have be Yisre'elim, not Nochrim (in Yevamos the text says 'converts').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Two verses say "in Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also the other verse is needed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi Yehudah):</span> Chalitzah was done in front of R. Tarfon. He told us to say twice "the one whose shoe was removed!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is learned from "his name will be called", not from "in Yisrael".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DEATH OF THE YAVAM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (She acquires herself through) the death of the Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We learn this from a Kal va'Chomer. Bi'ah with a married woman is punishable by (death by) choking, yet death of the husband permits her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Lav forbids Bi'ah (of a stranger) with a Yevamah. All the more so, death of the Yavam permits her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from a married woman, for she is permitted through a Get, whereas a Yevamah is not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chalitzah permits a Yevamah just like a Get permits a married woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from a married woman, for the one who forbids her (her husband) can permit her (through a Get)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Also here, the Yavam forbids her, and he can permit her through Chalitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that Chalitzah permits a married woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Get does not permit a Yevamah, but Chalitzah does. A Get permits a married woman, all the more so Chalitzah should!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "A Sefer of cutting" - a Sefer (Get) cuts her from her husband, and nothing else cuts her from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that a Get permits a Yevamah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chalitzah does not permit a married woman, but a Get does. Chalitzah permits a Yevamah, all the more so a Get should!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> "Like this (will be done to the Yavam)" - 'like this' is a requisite, there is no alternative (to Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Sometimes the Torah writes a requisite, yet we expound (other methods from) a Kal va'Chomer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Yom Kippur, it says "lottery" and "statute";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He will offer it for a Chatas" - the lottery designates one of the goats to be a Chatas, but naming it (calling it a Chatas) does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One might have thought to learn a Kal va'Chomer. Naming works where the lottery does not (when one has two birds, and needs to designate which will be the Chatas and which the Olah). All the more so, naming should work (for the goats of Yom Kippur) where the lottery works! The above verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If not for the verse, we would have learned a Kal va'Chomer, even though it says "statute"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> "(A Sefer of cutting will be written) for her (a married woman)" - for her, but not for a Yevamah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we expound "for her" - it must be Lishmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do! Two verses say "for her", so we can learn both.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The other verse is needed to teach "for her", but not for two women in one Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #3:</span> "(She will take off his) shoe" - she becomes permitted only through a shoe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn something else from this verse!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "his shoe" teaches that the Yavam must wear his own shoe!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Torah repeats "shoe" to include another man's shoe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "his shoe"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that it must be proper for him. This excludes a shoe too big for him to walk in, or too small and does not cover most of his foot, or a shoe without a heel.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah wrote "the shoe", to teach also our law (that a Get does not permit her).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ACQUISITION OF AN EVED IVRI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An Eved Ivri can be acquired through money or a document. He acquires his freedom through (finishing his six) years (of service), the Yovel year, or reduced redemption (based on the remaining time he should have served);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>An Amah acquires herself in these ways, or through Simanim (signs of becoming a Na'arah, i.e. two hairs after 12 years).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A Nirtza (a slave whose ear was pierced) is acquired through the piercing of the ear. He goes free in Yovel or when the master dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that an Eved Ivri can be acquired through money?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "(He will be redeemed) from the money of his purchase" teaches that he can be acquired through money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That refers to a Yisrael who sold himself to a Nochri, for a Nochri always acquires with money. What is the source for a Yisrael who sold himself to a Yisrael?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "She will be redeemed" teaches that her redemption is reduced (from her purchase price, according to the years she worked) and she goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This applies to an Amah. Since a Bas Yisrael is Mekudeshes with money, she is bought for money (since this may turn into Kidushin);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the source for a (male) Eved Ivri?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "A male or female Eved Ivri" equates them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That verse refers to a slave sold by Beis Din, since he is sold against his will (to pay for what he stole);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the source for one who sells himself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Gezeirah Shavah "Sachir-Sachir" equates one sold by Beis Din to one who sells himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a Tana that does not learn from this Gezeirah Shavah. What is his source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "And when he will attain (money to redeem himself)" equates one who sells himself to a Yisrael (the previous Parshah) with one who sells himself to a Nochri (the coming Parshah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the latter is acquired with money (above, (e)), also the former.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE GEZEIRAH SHAVAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana who does not learn from the Gezeirah Shavah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is Chachamim (the first Tana) of the following Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following apply to one who sells himself to be a slave. He may be sold for six years or longer. He cannot become a Nirtza. He does not receive gifts when he goes free. His master cannot mate him with a Shifchah (Kena'anis slave).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who is sold by Beis Din may be sold only for six years; he can become a Nirtza; he receives gifts when he goes free; and his master can mate him with a Shifchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Elazar (some texts - R. Eliezer) says, in either case he may be sold only for six years, he can become a Nirtza, he receives gifts when he goes free, and his master can mate him with a Shifchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim do not learn the Gezeirah Shavah, and R. Elazar does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Tivyomi):</span> No, all learn the Gezeirah Shavah. Chachamim expound verses (in the Parshah of one sold by Beis Din) to override the Gezeirah Shavah regarding these four laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> How do Chachamim learn about the term of sale?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will serve you for six years", but not one who sells himself (he may serve longer).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar expounds "he will serve you", but he will not serve your heir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim learn this from another verse that says "he served you".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Elazar says, the other verse comes to appease the master (you received much work, so do not mind that you must give gifts when the slave leaves).</p>
