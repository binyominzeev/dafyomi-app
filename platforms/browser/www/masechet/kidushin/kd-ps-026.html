<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ACQUISITIONS OF LAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Property that has Acharayos (if a borrower sold it, his creditor can take it from the buyer, i.e. land) can be acquired through money, a document, or Chazakah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Property without Acharayos (i.e. Metaltelim) is acquired through Meshichah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Property without Acharayos is acquired along with property with Acharayos when the latter is acquired through money, a document, or Chazakah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If Reuven can force Shimon to swear about Metaltelim, he can also make him swear about land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that money can acquire land?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Chizkiyah):</span> "Fields will be acquired through money".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A document should also be required, for it says "written in a Sefer and signed"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said "will be acquired" at the end of the verse, that would be correct;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, the verse says "will be acquired" right after "through money", to teach that money suffices by itself. The document is merely a proof of purchase.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Money acquires (by itself) only in a place where people normally don't write documents. Where they do, one acquires only with a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Even where documents are written, if he specifies that he will acquire with money alone, it works.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>When Rav Idi bar Avin would buy land, he would specify that he can acquire with money or the document, according to his choice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He specified that he can acquire with money, so he could stop the buyer from retracting (once money was given);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He specified that he can acquire with the document if he wants, so he could retract until the document was given.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (One acquires land...) or through a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "It was written in a Sefer and signed."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We said that this refers to a document of proof (that it was acquired through money)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we learn from "and I took the Sefer of acquisition".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A document acquires only a gift (by itself). A buyer acquires only after giving the money. (Only then the seller resolves to transfer ownership.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Hamnuna - Beraisa):</span> To acquire through a document, one may write on paper or pottery, even if it is not worth a Perutah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He writes 'my field is sold or given to you.' It takes effect (even for a sale, even before money is given)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Hamnuna):</span> The case is, he sells his field due to its low quality. (The seller wants the sale to take effect immediately.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Beraisa discusses only a gift;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The document mentions 'sold' to give the receiver more rights (e.g. he will be compensated if creditors take the land).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (One acquires land...) or through Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> "And dwell in the cities you took" - you took (acquired) the cities by dwelling in them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "You will inherit (Eretz Yisrael) and dwell in it" - you will inherit it by dwelling in it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ACQUISITIONS OF METALTELIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Property without Acharayos is acquired through Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "When... you will acquire from the hand of your friend" refers to something acquired from hand to hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan holds that mid'Oraisa, money acquires Metaltelim (and Chachamim enacted that Meshichah acquires instead). How does he explain the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches the law after Chachamim's enactment.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ACQUISITION OF METALTELIM AGAV LAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Property without Acharayos (is acquired along with land)...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Chizkiyah):</span> "Their father gave to them gifts... with fortified cities in Yehudah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must the Metaltelim be on the land that they are acquired with?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef - Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> The following laws apply to land, no matter how small it is: one must leave from it Pe'ah (an unharvested corner for the poor) and bring Bikurim (first fruits for the Kohen);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may write a Pruzbul on it (a document authorizing Beis Din to collect one's debts, so that Shemitah will not cancel them. We require that the borrower own land);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may acquire Metaltelim Agav the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of answer):</span> If the Metaltelim must be on the land, what could be acquired with a miniscule piece of land?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection: (Rav Shmuel bar Bizna):</span> Perhaps one stuck a needle in the land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer: (Rav Yosef):</span> Surely, the Tana would not elaborate to teach about acquiring a needle!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> Perhaps a precious gem hangs from a needle (and is acquired with the land)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> A case occurred in which a man wanted to give a gift of much Metaltelim. They told him that the only solution is to give them with land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He bought a Sela-plot of land and said 'the northern part is given to Ploni, and with it 100 flock and 100 barrels.' He died. They validated the gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Such a gift cannot fit on land the size of a Sela (a coin)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It was a large plot of land. It was as hard as a Sela (rock).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Yehudah):</span> A case occurred in which a man wanted to give much Metaltelim. According to R. Elazar (who says that there are no special acquisitions for a Shechiv Mera (one who fears lest he die from his illness), he was sick. According to Chachamim, he was healthy;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They told him that the only solution is to give them with land. He bought about 100 square Amos of land and said 'a square Tefach is given to Ploni, and with it 100 flock and 100 barrels.' He died. They validated the gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Such a gift cannot fit on land the size of a square Tefach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He gave enough coins to buy 100 flock and 100 barrels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> This must be the case. If not, he could have given them through Chalipin! (Anything except for coins can be acquired through Chalipin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It is no better to say that he gave coins. He could have given them through Meshichah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> You must say that Ploni was not there to do Meshichah. For the same reason, Chalipin was not possible!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he ask someone else to acquire for Ploni?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He feared lest that person keep the gift himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (in Tosfos) Answer:</span> Ploni was not there to do Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he ask someone else to acquire for Ploni?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He feared lest that person keep the gift himself. (This concern would not apply had he given flock and barrels, which can be acquired through Chalipin! Indeed, we conclude that he gave money.) (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they say that the only solution is to give them with land? There was another way, he just did not want to use it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he did not trust anyone there, the only solution was to give them with land.</p>
