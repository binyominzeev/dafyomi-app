<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN IS ONE WITNESS BELIEVED? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'a man had Bi'ah with your ox' and Shimon was silent, Reuven is believed (to disqualify the ox from being a Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one witness testified that an animal had Bi'ah with or killed a person, or the owner says this, he is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of one witness?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is not the owner, for this was taught separately!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the owner was quiet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>It is necessary to teach all three cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Had we taught only about Chelev, one might have thought that there one would not be silent unless he really transgressed (for we will force him to bring a Chatas, which is forbidden if he did not sin), but he might be silent when told that his food is Tamei, since he can eat it when he is Tamei (without any loss);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had we taught only about Tum'ah, one might have thought that there silence is an admission, for one prefers to eat his food when he is Tahor, but he might be silent when told about bestiality with his animal, since he does not plan to offer all his animals for Korbanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn that in all cases the witness is believed (Rashba; Rashi - Shimon's silence is an admission; Tosfos - his silence shows that he knows supporting evidence, so he relies on the witness).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS ONE WITNESS BELIEVED ABOUT ERVAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'your wife was Mezanah (forbidding her to you)' and Shimon was quiet, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Here also, Reuven is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He is not believed. Matters of Ervah (Kidushin, divorce, and adultery) require two witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye, for himself):</span> A blind man (Levi) used to learn in front of Shmuel. One day, he was late. They sent a messenger to get him. During this time, Levi came on a different path. The messenger returned and said that Levi's wife was Mezanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel (to Levi):</span> If you believe the messenger, you must divorce her. If not, you need not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'You believe' means that you do not think that he is a thief (i.e. a wanton liar).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> No, it means if you trust him like two witnesses, you must divorce her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye, for himself):</span> Once, King Yanai was very happy after conquering 60 cities. He invited Chachamim to a banquet of vegetables, to commemorate those who built the second Mikdash (they were very poor).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Eliezer ben Po'ira (a lowlife, to Yanai):</span> Chachamim detest you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yanai:</span> How can I know?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Eliezer:</span> Wear the Tzitz (the Kohen Gadol's head-plate) and see their reaction.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Yanai did this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah ben Gedidyah (a Chacham):</span> King Yanai, it suffices that you are king. Do not presume to be a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Yanai was not considered a Kosher Kohen, for people said that his mother was captured (before Yanai was conceived, disqualifying her to Kehunah). The matter was investigated, and it was not found (to be true).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim angrily left the banquet.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Eliezer:</span> King Yanai, a commoner may bear such indignity, but not you, a king and Kohen Gadol!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Yanai:</span> What should I do?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Eliezer:</span> Kill them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Yanai:</span> What will happen to Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Eliezer:</span> The Sefer Torah will remain for anyone who wants to learn.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> At this point, Yanai became a heretic. He should have countered 'what will happen to oral Torah?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>Yanai killed (virtually) all the Chachamim. The world was desolate until Shimon ben Shetach restored Torah to its greatness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (People said that his mother was captured, but it was not found.) What was the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Two witnesses said that she was captured, and two said that she was not.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why would we rely on the latter ones (and say that it was found to be false)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, one witness said that she was captured (and two contradicted him).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of Abaye's support):</span> Had two witnesses not contradicted him, one witness would have been believed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Really, two witnesses testified that she had been captured;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question 12):</span> The case is, the first witnesses were Huzmu (the latter witnesses testified that the first witnesses were not present at the time and place they claimed to have seen the testimony), therefore we rely on the latter ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yitzchak):</span> The latter witnesses testified that Yanai's mother was switched right away with a slave and escaped from captivity. She was never alone with the captors to become disqualified to Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">66b----------------------------------------66b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava, for himself):</span> A Beraisa teaches that one witness is not believed about Ervah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Tarfon):</span> If a Mikvah was Muchzak to have the required amount of water, and it was measured and found to be deficient, we do not say that anything Tamei that was immersed in the Mikvah (or that touched something that was immersed in it) is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, it is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> The Chazakah is that the Mikvah was full. If there is a doubt about its status at the time that people or Kelim immersed, don't assume that it was deficient!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> The Chazakah of the person (or Kli) who immersed in the Mikvah was to be Tamei. If there is a doubt about whether or not he became Tahor (perhaps the Mikvah was deficient), don't assume that he became Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> Our case resembles a Kohen who was offering Korbanos on the Mizbe'ach, and it became known that he was born to a divorcee or Chalutzah (so he is a Chalal, i.e. disqualified). What he offered is acceptable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> No, our case resembles a Kohen who was offering on the Mizbe'ach, and it became known that he was blemished. What he offered is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Tarfon):</span> Is our case more comparable to a Kohen found to be a Chalal, or one found to be blemished?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Akiva):</span> One witness can testify that a Mikvah is invalid, and also that a Kohen is blemished. These are more comparable, for two witnesses are needed to testify that a Kohen is a Chalal;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Also, a deficient Mikvah and a blemished Kohen are disqualified due to themselves, unlike a Chalal, who is disqualified due to others (his mother).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> Separating from you is like death (you are correct)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what case can one witness testify about a blemished Kohen?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the Kohen denies the blemish, one witness is not believed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Kohen is silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Culmination of support:</span> The Mishnah requires two witnesses to disqualify a Chalal! (This shows that one witness is not believed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> Really, the Kohen denies the blemish. One witness is believed, for if the Kohen is telling the truth, he must show us that he has no blemish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This explains 'a deficient Mikvah and a blemished Kohen are disqualified due to themselves. We do not learn from a Chalal, who is disqualified due to others.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if a Chalal served in the Mikdash, what he offered is acceptable?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> "(Kehunah) will be to him (Aharon) and his seed", whether Kosher or disqualified seed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel's father):</span> "Hash-m blessed Cheilo (His legion), and the work of His hands will be acceptable" - even the Avodah of Chalalim is accepted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yanai) Question:</span> Why does it say "you will come to the Kohen who will be in those days"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to a Kohen who was Kosher, and then was found to be a Chalal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if a blemished Kohen served in the Mikdash, what he offered is unacceptable?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "I (Hash-m) give to (Pinchas) My covenant of Shalom" - when he is Shalem, not lacking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Shalom"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> There is a tradition to write the 'Vov' of "Shalom" broken (hinting that we read the word as if there was no Vav).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHOSE LINEAGE DO CHILDREN FOLLOW?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In any permitted marriage, the lineage of the child follows the father;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is the daughter of a Kohen, Levi or Yisrael who married a Kohen, Levi or Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In any forbidden marriage in which Kidushin is Tofes, the lineage of the child follows the (more) blemished parent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is a widow married to a Kohen Gadol, a divorcee or Chalutzah to a regular Kohen, a Mamzeres or Nesinah to a Yisrael, or a Bas Yisrael to a Mamzer or Nasin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Whenever Reuven cannot be Mekadesh Leah, but other men can be Mekadesh her, children of Reuven and Leah are Mamzerim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is any of the forbidden Arayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Whenever no one can be Mekadesh Sally, her children are like her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is a Shifchah or Nochris.</p>
