<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A SHALI'ACH TO SIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Me'ilah and selling or slaughtering a stolen animal are Shnei Kesuvim. Therefore, we do not learn to other cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (If witnesses convict a Ganav (covert thief), he pays twice what he stole. If he stole a Seh (sheep or goat) or ox, and slaughtered or sold it, he pays four or five times its value.) What is the source to obligate a thief (four or five) through sale or slaughter of his Shali'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "He will slaughter or sell (the animal he stole)" - just like selling it involves another party, also slaughtering it (can).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "(Slaughter) or (sell)" includes through a Shali'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (d'Vei Chizkiyah):</span> "Tachas (in place of)" includes through a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Answer (a) is like the opinion that Shnei Kesuvim do not teach to other places.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that they do teach, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Shechutei Chutz (slaughtering Kodshim outside the Mikdash), it says "to that man", not to his Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn all other transgressions from here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we learn from there that one is not liable for a Shali'ach's Aveirah? We should learn from Me'ilah and Shelichus Yad (or selling or slaughtering a stolen animal) that one is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>There is an extra verse regarding Shechutei Chutz - "that man will be get Kares";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since we already know that one is not liable for a Shali'ach's Aveirah regarding Shechutei Chutz, this comes to teach about all other Aveiros!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The opinion that does not learn from Shnei Kesuvim does not need to learn this from here. What does he learn from the two verses "that man"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One exempts (from Kares) two people who hold a knife together and slaughter (Shechutei Chutz). The other exempts one who was forced, Shogeg, or was mistaken.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The opinion that learns from Shnei Kesuvim learns this from the extra letter Hei (each time it says "ha'Hu");</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The other opinion does not expound the extra letter Hei.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A SHALI'ACH TO MURDER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Levi made Shimon a Shali'ach to kill someone (and he did), Shimon is liable, and Levi is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Shamai says, Levi is liable - "you (David) killed him (Uriyah) with the sword of Amon".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Shamai's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He holds that we learn from Shnei Kesuvim, but he does not expound the extra Hei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He expounds the extra Hei. The sender is liable b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the first Tana exempt b'Yedei Shamayim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both agree that he is liable. Shamai obligates him to a greater degree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Shamai learns from "you killed...." that one who makes a Shali'ach to murder is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The other Tana explains "you killed him with the sword of Amon" - just like you will not be punished for the sword of Amon, you will not be punished for Uriyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He rebelled against the king (so he deserved to be killed) by saying "my master Yo'av..." (Tosfos - he did not obey David's command to go home).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> According to Answer #1 (Shamai holds that normally, one who sends a Shali'ach to sin is liable), Shamai would admit that if Levi sent Shimon to have forbidden Bi'ah or to eat forbidden food, Levi is exempt and Shimon is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We never find that the one who benefits is exempt, and someone else is liable.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN A SHALI'ACH BE A WITNESS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav):</span> A Shali'ach can be a witness (on his mission).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(D'Vei R. Shila):</span> He cannot be a witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is d'Vei R. Shila's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The sender did not ask him to be a witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, if one was Mekadesh a woman in front of two men and did not tell them to be witnesses, she should not be Mekudeshes! (Surely, this is not so!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Rav holds that he can be a witness, for the testimony is better when a Shali'ach does the matter (R. Elazar Meir Horowitz - we just mean that it is no worse in this case);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>D'Vei R. Shila holds that he cannot, for Reuven's Shali'ach is like Reuven (whatever he does is attributed to Reuven, so he may not testify about Reuven).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> If a man told three men 'be Mekadesh a woman to me', one man is a Shali'ach, and the other two are witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel say, all are Sheluchim, and a Shali'ach cannot be a witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue only about three men (for it is possible to have a Shali'ach and two witnesses). All agree that if he told two men, they are only Sheluchim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav holds like the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> Beis Shamai say, a Shali'ach can be one of the two necessary witnesses (for Kidushin);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel say, he cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rav hold like Beis Shamai?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav switches the opinions of Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Acha Brei d'Rava):</span> Rav holds that a Shali'ach cannot be a witness. D'Vei R. Shila holds that he can be a witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Halachah is, a Shali'ach can be a witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a man told two men 'be Mekadesh a woman to me', they are Sheluchim and witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same applies to divorce, and to monetary missions (e.g. Sheluchim to repay a loan).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">43b----------------------------------------43b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>It is necessary to teach about all three cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had we taught only about Kidushin, we would say that we believe the Sheluchim because they forbid her, but we would not believe them about divorce, lest (they were not Sheluchim, and) they lie because they want to marry her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had we taught only about divorce, we would say that we believe the Sheluchim because they cannot both marry her (and one would not lie to help the other), but we would not believe them to say that they gave the money to the lender, lest they lie to keep the money and split it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rava's opinion about repaying loans?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He holds that one who borrowed money in front of witnesses must repay in front of witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Sheluchim profit from their testimony!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they would say that they didn't give the money (to the lender), they would need to return the money to the borrower.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that one who borrowed money in front of witnesses need not repay in front of witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the Sheluchim would be believed to say that they returned the money to the sender, they do not profit by saying that they paid the lender.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, now that Shevu'as Heses was enacted (one who totally denies a claim must swear), the Sheluchim would profit if they testified (this would exempt them from swearing)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Rather, the Sheluchim swear that they paid the lender, the lender swears that he was not paid, and the borrower must pay the lender.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHO RECEIVES KIDUSHIN AND THE GET?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man can be Mekadesh his daughter...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One can divorce a Na'arah Arusah (during Erusin) by giving the Get to her or to her father;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, we never find that each of two people has jurisdiction over one person. Rather, only her father can receive it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Any girl who cannot (does not know to) guard her Get cannot be divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Chachamim and Rebbi Yehudah argue similarly about who can receive Kidushin for a Na'arah (only the father, or also herself);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They argue only about divorce. All agree that only her father can receive her Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi Yosi bar Chanina):</span> R. Yochanan explains Chachamim as follows. When a girl is divorced, she returns herself to her father's jurisdiction, so (also) she can receive her own Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When she becomes Mekudeshes, she extracts herself from her father's jurisdiction, so only he can receive her Kidushin.</p>
