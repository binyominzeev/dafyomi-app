<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CHILUL B'MEZID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> If an animal was found (in any direction) outside Yerushalayim, no further than the distance from Yerushalayim to Migdal Eder, if it is a male, it is (treated as) an Olah. If it is a female, it is (treated as) a Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A male could also be a Shelamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Oshaya):</span> The case is, the finder accepts on himself to bring the Korban that the one who lost the animal needed to bring;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah means that if it is a male, we are also concerned lest it is an Olah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah is like R. Meir, who says that one can be Mechalel Kedushas ha'Guf (something used for Avodah in the Mikdash) b'Mezid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Kedushas ha'Guf cannot become profaned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2):</span> The only case of transgressing Me'ilah repeatedly with the same item is with a Korban or Kli Shares (they are never profaned as long as can be used for Avodah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven rode on a Korban, then Shimon, and then Levi, all transgressed Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If they all drank from a gold Kli Shares, all transgressed Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mishnah #2 is like Rebbi Yehudah. Mishnah #1 is like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We can infer R. Meir's opinion from Rebbi Yehudah's!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi Yehudah holds that Hekdesh is Mischalel b'Shogeg, but Kedushas ha'Guf is never Mischalel. R. Meir holds that Hekdesh is Mischalel b'Mezid, but presumably he agrees that Kedushas ha'Guf is never Mischalel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi Yehudah said that Kedushas ha'Guf is never Mischalel, for he holds that Chilul is only b'Shogeg;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir holds that Chilul applies when intends to do so. This can apply even to Kedushas ha'Guf!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Oshaya):</span> Perhaps R. Meir holds that intent for Chilul helps for Kedushas Damim  (something not used for Avodah; Hekdesh will sell it) and Kodshei Kodoshim (for these are totally Hash-m's);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We have no source that he says so about Kodshim Kalim (e.g. Shelamim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yakov):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that all the more so, Me'ilah applies to Kodshim Kalim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chama bar Ukva):</span> R. Meir holds that Me'ilah applies b'Mezid, but not b'Shogeg, both for Kodshei Kodoshim and Kodshim Kalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Kal va'Chomer teaches this. If Kodshei Kodoshim are profaned, all the more so Kodshim Kalim!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (to R. Oshaya - R. Yochanan):</span> Should one transgress b'Mezid (to profane the animal) to help the one who lost it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> Rather, the finder waits until the animal gets a blemish. He brings a male and a second animal, and stipulates. (If the lost animal was an Olah, it is redeemed onto the first animal, and the second animal is a voluntary Shelamim. If the lost animal was a Shelamim, it is redeemed onto the second animal, and the first animal is a voluntary Olah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>POSSIBILITIES FOR A MALE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a male is found, (we are concerned lest) it is an Olah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is a Todah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he brings also a Todah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Loaves must be brought with a Todah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he brings also loaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is a Korban Asham!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Most) Ashamos must be two years old. The case is, (we can tell that) a yearling animal was found.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is an Asham of a Metzora or a (Tamei) Nazir (which are yearlings)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Those are rare. We are not concerned lest the animal was one of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it was a Korban Pesach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People are careful with the Korban Pesach before Pesach (they would not lose it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After Pesach, it becomes a Shelamim (and we are concerned for this)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is a Bechor, or Ma'aser Beheimah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Bechor or Ma'aser Beheimah is not redeemed. After it gets a Mum, it is eaten with restrictions (one may not sell it in the market, or weigh it). These restrictions apply to (a blemished Korban that was redeemed, and hence to) the found animal!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>POSSIBILITIES FOR A FEMALE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it is a female, (we are concerned lest) it is a Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is a Todah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, one also brings a Todah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Loaves must be brought with a Todah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he brings also loaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is a Chatas!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Chatas is at most one year old. The case is, (we can tell that) the animal found was more than a year old.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is a Chatas that was not offered within its first year!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is rare. We are not concerned for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a yearling (female) animal is found, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Chananya ben Chachinai):</span> (If one finds) a yearling female goat (or lamb, it) is a Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot offer it. Perhaps it is not a Chatas!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We are stringent, lest it is a Chatas. We lock it in a pen, and it dies on its own.</p>
