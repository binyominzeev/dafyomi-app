<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CHILDREN OF CHALALIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The daughter of a male Chalal is forever forbidden to Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a Yisrael married a Chalalah, his daughter is permitted to Kehunah. If a Chalal married a Bas Yisrael, his daughter is forbidden to Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, the daughter of a male convert is like the daughter of a Chalal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, if a Yisrael married a convert, or convert married a Bas Yisrael, the daughter is permitted to Kehunah, but the daughter of two converts is forbidden to Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The law is the same for converts and freed slaves. Even after 10 generations, the daughter is forbidden to Kehunah unless her mother is a Bas Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rebbi Yosi says, even the daughter of two converts is permitted to Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does it say (a male Chalal's daughter is) forever (forbidden to Kehunah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that her Isur is like that of Mitzriyim and Edomim, i.e. until three generations. 'Forever' teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Yisrael married a Chalalah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It says "(a Kohen) will not profane his seed among his nation", and "(a Kohen) will not become Tamei among his nation";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like (the Isur of) Tum'ah applies only to male Kohanim, not females, also profaning seed applies only to males.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the daughter of a Kohen Gadol (from a widow) should be Kesheirah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It does not say 'he will not profane his son', rather, "he will not profane his seed." This includes his daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The daughter of a Kohen Gadol's son should be Kesheirah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will not profane his seed" equates his seed to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like his daughter is disqualified, also his son's daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The daughter of a Kohen Gadol's daughter should be disqualified!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This cannot be, for then the Gezeirah Shavah between Tum'ah and profaning seed would not teach anything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Chalal married a Bas Yisrael, his daughter is forbidden to Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha taught this! The daughter of a male Chalal is forever forbidden to Kehunah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we needed to teach about a Yisrael who married a Chalalah, we repeated a Chalal who married a Bas Yisrael for parallel structure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Our Mishnah is unlike R. Dostai ben Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Dostai ben Yehudah):</span> Just like Bnei Yisrael purify Chalalos (i.e. their children are Kesheirim), also Benos Yisrael purify Chalalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Dostai's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "he will not profane his seed among his nation" - (when his seed marries) among one nation (i.e. within Kehunah), the children are profaned. Among a different nation (outside Kehunah), the children are not profaned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE WOMAN BECOMES DISQUALIFIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> It says "he will not profane his seed." What is the source that also his wife is profaned?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Kal va'Chomer: his children, who didn't sin, are profaned. His wife sinned, all the more so she is profaned!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Her husband disproves this. He sinned, but he is not profaned!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That is no disproof, for a (Kosher) Kohen never becomes profaned. A woman can be profaned (e.g. through Bi'ah with a Mamzer), she is profaned here!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If you prefer, "he will not profane" refers to one who was Kosher, and now becomes profaned, i.e. his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What objection might we have to Answer #1?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>One can ask that his seed was created through sin (therefore it is profaned, but his wife was not). Therefore, we give Answer #2.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Who is a Chalalah? It is anyone born from disqualified parents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to a woman forbidden to her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One may not remarry his divorcee (if she married someone else in between), but the children are Kesheirim!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"To'evah Hi" - she is an abomination, but her children are not abominations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It means, anyone born from (a Kohen and) a woman forbidden to Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A widow (who had Bi'ah with a Kohen Gadol), Zonah or divorcee (who had Bi'ah with a Kohen) becomes a Chalalah, even if she was not born from women forbidden to Kohanim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> The Beraisa asks 'who is the Chalalah the Torah mentions, who was never Kesheirah? It is anyone born from a woman forbidden to Kohanim.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'the Torah mentions' refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yitzchak bar Avin):</span> We ask 'who is the Chalalah explicit in the Torah ("Kohanim will not marry... a Chalalah" - she was a Chalalah even before marrying a Kohen) that Chachamim need not explain? It is anyone born from a woman forbidden to Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DOES AN ISUR TAKE EFFECT IN ADDITION TO A PREVIOUS ISUR?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen Gadol married three widows, he is liable only once. If he married three divorcees he is liable only once;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he married a widow who is a divorcee, a Chalalah and a Zonah and the events (which made her a widow, divorcee, Chalalah and Zonah) occurred in this order, he is liable for each one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the events occurred in the reverse order, e.g. she had Bi'ah with Ervah, then with a Kohen, then she was divorced, and then widowed, he is liable only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of three widows?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he had Bi'ah with the widows of Reuven, Shimon and Levi, why is he liable only once? They are different women, and widows of different men!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">77b----------------------------------------77b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he had Bi'ah three times with one widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was warned only once, obviously, he is liable only once!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he was warned each time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, why is he liable only once?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nazir drank wine all day, he is lashed only once. If he was warned repeatedly, he is liable for each warning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He had Bi'ah with Reuven's widow, who is also Shimon's widow and Levi's widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since she is the widow of different men, he is liable for each. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa discusses a widow who is a divorcee, a Chalalah and a Zonah. What does the Tana hold regarding Isur Chal Al Isur (does a second Isur takes effect on something already forbidden)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he holds that Isur Chal Al Isur, he should be liable for each even in these occurred to her in the reverse order!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he holds that Ein Isur Chal Al Isur, even in this order he should be liable only once!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Normally, he holds that Ein Isur Chal Al Isur. If the new Isur is Mosif (forbids the Isur to more people or actions), it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A widow is forbidden to a Kohen Gadol and permitted to a regular Kohen. When she was divorced, she became forbidden to all Kohanim. Therefore, the Isur of a divorcee takes effect also for a Kohen Gadol;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A divorcee may eat Terumah (e.g. a Bas Kohen without children). When she became a Chalalah, she became forbidden to eat Terumah. Therefore, the Isur of a Chalalah takes effect also for a Kohen Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Zonah does not add to the Isur Chalalah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chana bar Rav Katina):</span> Since Znus forbids a woman even to a Yisrael (i.e. adultery), it is considered Mosif to Chalalah (which applies only to Kehunah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> "He (a Kohen Gadol) will not take (a widow)" applies only to a woman to whom (originally) applied "he will take";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This excludes a Kohen Gadol's widowed sister (he is liable only for Bi'ah with a sister, not for Bi'ah with a widow).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> This is like R. Shimon, who holds that Ein Isur Chal Al Isur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> One who eats a Neveilah on Yom Kippur is exempt (from Kares if it was a Neveilah before Yom Kippur).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Chachamim, Isur Chal Al Isur (the Isur of a widow takes effect on his sister)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is even like Chachamim. They said only that a severe Isur (Yom Kippur) is Chal on a light Isur (Neveilah), but a light Isur is not Chal on a severe Isur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> The Beraisa is like Chachamim. They say only that a severe Isur is Chal on a light Isur, but a light Isur is not Chal on a severe Isur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be like R. Shimon. He holds that even a severe Isur is not Chal on a light Isur, so he would not need to teach that a light Isur is not Chal on a severe Isur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It can even be like R. Shimon. One might have thought that the special Isurim of Kohanim are different (they are Chal on severe Isurim). The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT MAKES A CHALALAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If a Yisrael had Bi'ah with his sister, this makes her a Zonah. Does it also make her a Chalalah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Chayavei Lavin (such like a widow to a Kohen Gadol) makes a woman a Chalalah, all the more so Chayavei Kerisus!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps Chalalah results only from Isurim of Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Chalalah results only from Isurim of Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Had the Torah not said that a divorcee is forbidden to a Kohen Gadol, we could have learned it from a Kal va'Chomer: a divorcee is forbidden even to a regular Kohen, all the more so, to a Kohen Gadol!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Torah wrote the Isur to teach that just like the Isur of a divorcee is distinct for a regular Kohen from the Isurim of Chalalah and Zonah (it is written by itself, to teach that one gets separate lashes for it), also for a Kohen Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously, a Kohen Gadol should have all the Isurim of a regular Kohen!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, just like the Isur of a divorcee is distinct for a regular Kohen from the Isurim of Chalalah and Zonah, also the Isur of a widow for a Kohen Gadol is distinct from the Isurim of a divorcee, Chalalah and Zonah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Torah need to forbid a Chalalah to a Kohen Gadol (she is forbidden even to a regular Kohen)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Chalalah comes only from Isurim of Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Torah need to forbid a Zonah to a Kohen Gadol?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is for a Gezeirah Shavah Zonah-Zonah from a regular Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like a Kohen Gadol's children from a Zonah are Chulin (Chalalim), also a regular Kohen's.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Therefore, if a Kohen has Bi'ah with his sister, he makes her a Zonah, not a Chalalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he has a second act of Bi'ah with her, this makes her a Chalalah (for she is now a Zonah, one of them special Isurei Kehunah).</p>
