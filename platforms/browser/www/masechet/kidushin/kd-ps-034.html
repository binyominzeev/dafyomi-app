<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE MITZVOS OF WOMEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any Mitzvas Aseh sheha'Zman Gerama (it applies only at certain times)...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following Mitzvos are Zman Gerama: Sukah, Lulav, Shofar, Tzitzis and Tefilin;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">The following Mitzvos are not Zman Gerama:</span> building a railing around one's roof, returning an Aveidah, and sending away the mother bird.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah's law is not always true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Simchah (on Yom Tov) and Hakhel (gathering in the Mikdash on Sukos to hear the king read the Torah) are Zman Gerama, yet women are obligated!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, learning Torah, Peru u'Revu (having children), and redemption of a firstborn son are not Zman Gerama, yet women are exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> We do not learn from general rules, even when the rule lists exceptions.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any food may be used for an Eruv (Chatzeiros) or Shituf (an Eruv for Mavo'os) except for water and salt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also mushrooms cannot be used! This shows that one cannot rely on a general rule, even if it lists exceptions.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE SOURCE TO EXEMPT WOMEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Women are exempt from Mitzvos Aseh sheha'Zman Gerama.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Tefilin:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like women are exempt from Tefilin, they are exempt from every Aseh sheha'Zman Gerama.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn Tefilin from Talmud Torah. Just like women are exempt from Talmud Torah, they are exempt from Tefilin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should rather equate Tefilin to Mezuzah (which is obligatory for women)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Tefilin is equated (written next to) Talmud Torah in the first two Parshiyos of Shema. It is equated to Mezuzah only in the first Parshah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should equate Mezuzah to Talmud Torah (and exempt women from Mezuzah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We fulfill the Mitzvah of Mezuzah "in order that your days will be lengthened." Women also need this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Sukah is Zman Gerama. "Ha'Ezrach" exempts women. If not for the verse, they would be obligated (unlike the general rule)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> If not for the verse, we would have obligated them because it says "Teishvu", (sit in the Sukah) like you dwell, i.e. a man with his wife.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> If not for the verse, we would have obligated them from a Gezeirah Shavah "Chamesh Esreh-Chamesh Esreh" from Pesach. Just like women are commanded to eat Matzah on Pesach, they must dwell in Sukos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ha'Ezrach" teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Re'iyah (the Mitzvah to enter the Mikdash on each festival) is an Aseh sheha'Zman Gerama, and "your males" exempts women. If not for the verse, they would be obligated!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If not for the verse we would have obligated them from a Gezeirah Shavah "Re'iyah-Re'iyah" from Hakhel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we learn from Tefilin that women are exempt from Mitzvas Aseh sheha'Zman Gerama? We should learn from the Mitzvah of Simchah (on Yom Tov) that they are obligated!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> A woman herself is not obligated in Simchah. Rather, her husband is obligated to be Mesame'ach her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A widow has no husband. The Mitzvah must be on her herself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is incumbent on her male neighbor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should learn from Hakhel that women are obligated (in Mitzvos Aseh sheha'Zman Gerama)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Matzah and Hakhel are Shnei Kesuvim (two verses, and both obligate women in an Aseh sheha'Zman Gerama), so they do not teach about other things.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also Tefilin and Re'iyah are Shnei Kesuvim (exempting women from an Aseh sheha'Zman Gerama), so we should not learn from them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Neither of them could be learned from the other (so they are not considered Shnei Kesuvim):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had the Torah taught only (that women are exempt from) Tefilin, we would have obligated them in Re'iyah from the Gezeirah Shavah from Hakhel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had the Torah taught only Re'iyah, we would have obligated women in Tefilin, because it is equated to Mezuzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Similarly, we could not have learned either Matzah or Hakhel from the other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Granted, had the Torah taught only Hakhel, we would have exempted women from Matzah from the Gezeirah Shavah "Chamesh Esreh-Chamesh Esreh" from Sukos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, it could have taught only Matzah, and we would have known Hakhel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even infants are obligated in Hakhel, all the more so women!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Therefore, these are Shnei Kesuvim, so we do not learn to other places.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WOMEN ARE OBLIGATED IN MITZVOS ASEH SHE'LO HA'ZMAN GERAMA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> This answer is like the opinion that Shnei Kesuvim do not teach about other laws;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that Shnei Kesuvim do teach about other laws, how can we answer? (This question will be asked again, and answered, on 35a.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> What is the source to obligate women in Mitzvos Aseh she'Lo ha'Zman Gerama?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Question #2):</span> We learn from fearing parents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn from Talmud Torah that women are exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Talmud Torah and Peru u'Revu are Shnei Kesuvim exempting women, one of which could have been learned from the other, so we do not learn from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan ben Berokah says that "Hash-m said 'Peru u'Revu'" also to women (they are also commanded). How can he answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Learning Torah and Pidyon ha'Ben are Shnei Kesuvim exempting women, so we do not learn from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan ben Berokah, fear of parents and having children are Shnei Kesuvim obligating women, so we should not learn from them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We could not have learned one of them from the other:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had the Torah written only fearing, one might have thought that since it says (about Peru u'Revu) "v'Kivshu'ha (and he will conquer (the land))", it is the way of a man to conquer, so only he is commanded to have children;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had the Torah written only Peru u'Revu, one might have thought that since a man is able to honor his parents (but not a woman, for she must honor her husband), only he is commanded to fear his parents.</p>
