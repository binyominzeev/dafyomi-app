<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A DOCUMENT CAN ACQUIRE SLAVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> With a document...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> "If he (a master who married his Amah) will take another wife" equates an Amah to a wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a wife can be acquired through a document, also an Amah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This is like the opinion that the master writes the document to acquire an Amah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that the father writes the document, we cannot learn from here (for it is unlike Kidushin)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The master writes the document to acquire an Amah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Her father writes it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> "She will not go out like (Kena'ani) slaves go out", but she is acquired like slaves, namely, through a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps she is acquired like slaves, through Chazakah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "You will bequeath them (Kena'ani slaves) to your children (for an inheritance)." They are acquired as an inheritance (through Chazakah), but others (Yisrael slaves) are not acquired through Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they are acquired through a document, but others are not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "She (an Amah) will not go out like slaves", but she is acquired like slaves, through a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we learn the other way! "You will bequeath them" teaches that a document does not work, and "she will not go out" teaches that Chazakah works!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to learn that a document works, since it can divorce a Bas Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that Chazakah works, for it can acquire Hefker property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We do not find that Chazakah works regarding marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Since the Torah equated an Amah to a wife, we learn a document, which also acquires a wife (even if the different parties write the documents).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Huna does not need "she will not go out as slaves go out" to teach that she is acquired through a document. What does he learn from it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that she does not go free if her master destroys one of her extremal limbs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Chisda holds that had the Torah wanted to teach only that, it would have said "she will not go out like slaves." It added "like slaves go out", to also teach about their acquisition.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FREEDOM OF SLAVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A slave acquires his freedom through (finishing six) years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We learn from "six years he will work; in the seventh..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> And in Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We learn from "until the Yovel year he will work with you."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Through paying his reduced redemption (according to the years he worked).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> "She will be redeemed" teaches that her redemption is reduced, and she goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A slave can acquire himself through money, Shavah Kesef or a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn about money from "from the money of his purchase."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn about Shavah Kesef from "he will return his redemption", which includes Shavah Kesef.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of the document?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The slave wrote a document saying that he owes his redemption to his master.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is redemption through money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is a Get of freedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a document needed? The master can simply say in front of two witnesses, or in front of Beis Din, 'go'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference (Rava):</span> Since the Tana considers a document to be a method of freedom, this implies that it is not enough to say 'go'. This shows that an Eved Ivri is acquired bodily to his master (not just his earnings);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, the master cannot pardon the servitude. A Get of freedom is needed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW AN AMAH GOES FREE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An Amah acquires herself in these ways (like an Eved Ivri), or through Simanim (of Na'arus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that an Amah acquires herself when her father dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Simanim do not remove her from her father's jurisdiction, but it frees her from her master. Death of her father makes her leave her father's jurisdiction. All the more so it frees her from her master!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Hoshaya - Mishnah):</span> An Amah acquires herself in these ways, or through Simanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Tana omitted some cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (He would not omit only one case.) What else did he omit?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He omitted death of the master.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is not an omission, for it applies also to male slaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Tana omitted death of the father because it varies (when he will die). He listed only ways that are fixed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Simanim are not fixed (when she will grow hairs)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Safra):</span> Although they might not come for a long time, there is a lower limit:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a boy no more than nine years old that grew two hairs, they are Shuma (not Simanim of adulthood);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If a child (the Gemara in Nidah explains that this clause discusses a girl) between nine and 12 grew two hairs, they are Shuma;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Rebbi Yosi says, they are Simanim (if she still has them when she is 12);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>If a boy above 13 grew two hairs, they are Simanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Gifts are given to slaves who go free in any of four ways. Three apply to men, and three to women. We cannot find four in either gender, because men do not go free at adulthood, and a woman cannot be Nirtza'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Reish Lakish, R. Shimon should include an Amah who goes free when her father dies!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Tana omitted this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Tana said there are (only) four!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Tana omitted death of the father because it varies. He listed only ways that are fixed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Simanim are not fixed, yet R. Shimon taught them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We answer like Rav Safra did (although there is no upper limit, there is a lower limit).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Death of the master is not fixed, yet R. Shimon taught it! (This is the way that applies only to a male.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. The four ways are: six years; Yovel; a Nirtza who leaves in Yovel; and a girl who leaves through Simanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> He said that you cannot find four ways regarding a woman. If he includes death of the master, there are four ways regarding a woman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Amram - Beraisa):</span> These receive gifts (when they go free): one who leaves after six years, in Yovel, when the master dies, or an Amah who becomes a Na'arah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Reish Lakish, the Tana should also list death of the father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Tana omitted this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Tana said 'these' (are the only cases)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Tana listed only ways that are fixed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Simanim are not fixed, yet the Tana taught them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We answer like Rav Safra did.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Death of the master is not fixed, yet the Tana taught it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Reish Lakish is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reish Lakish had a Kal va'Chomer. Why is he wrong?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is an objection to the Kal va'Chomer. She goes free through Simanim because her body changed (she became a Na'arah). This does not apply to death of the father.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHO GETS THE GIFTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> An Eved Ivri or Amah Ivriyah keeps his or her own gifts;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> The gifts and Metzi'os (Hefker objects that she finds) of an Amah belong to her father. The master is compensated for the time she ceased to work to take the Metzi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> In Beraisa #1 she left through Simanim, and in Beraisa #2 she left through death of her father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, in both cases, she left through Simanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Beraisa #1 she left after her father's death. In Beraisa #2 she left in her father's lifetime.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> An Amah keeps her own gifts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that her brothers do not get them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "You will bequeath them (Kena'ani slaves) to your children", but you do not bequeath your daughters to your sons.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This teaches that sons do not inherit privileges that their father had in his daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Beraisa #1 teach that a male Eved Ivri keeps his own gifts? Who else would get them?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> Indeed, we learn nothing from these words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa is like Tutai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tutai):</span> "(The gifts go) to him (the slave)", and not to his creditor. (Normally, a creditor may take money owed to the one who owes him, like R. Nasan taught.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHICH SLAVES GET GIFTS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following receive gifts: one who leaves after six years; in Yovel; when the master dies; and an Amah who brought Simanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A slave who runs away or is redeemed does not receive gifts;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, a slave who runs away gets no gifts, but a slave who is redeemed receives gifts;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon says, four types of slaves receive gifts when they go free. Three apply to men, and three to women. We cannot find four in either gender, because men do not go free through Simanim, and a woman cannot be Nirtza'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Tana'im's source for who receives gifts?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Question:</span> Perhaps only a slave who leaves after six years receives gifts! What is the source to include one who leaves in Yovel, when the master dies, or an Amah who brings Simanim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the repetition "you will send him... when you will send him."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we include even one who runs away, or is redeemed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "When you will send him free from you" - gifts are only when you (the master) send the slave. This excludes these cases, in which you did not send him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Meir says, one who runs away gets no gifts, for the master did not send him. One who is redeemed gets gifts, for the master sends him (by receiving the money).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would we think that one who flees gets gifts? He must complete his service!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Six years he will serve you" teaches that a slave who flees must complete his term;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps even if a slave was ill, he must complete his term!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "In the seventh year he will leave" teaches that this is not so.</p>
