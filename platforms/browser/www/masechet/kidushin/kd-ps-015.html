<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ALL CAN LEARN THE GEZEIRAH SHAVAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> How do Chachamim learn about piercing the ear?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "His master will bore through his ear with an awl", and not through the ear of one who sold himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Elazar uses the verse for a Gezeirah Shavah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar) Question:</span> What is the source that the right ear is pierced?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Ozen" here, and regarding a Metzora. Just like there it refers to (putting blood and oil on) the right ear, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If it were written only for the Gezeirah Shavah, it would say "Ozen". Rather, it says "Ozno (his ear)", to exclude the ear of one who sold himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> "His ear" excludes an Amah from becoming a Nirtza'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We learn that from "if the (male) slave will say", not a female slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> "The slave" teaches that he must say (that he wants to remain a slave) before his six years end.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The extra 'Hei' (the slave) teaches that.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>R. Elazar does not expound the 'Hei'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> How do Chachamim learn about gifts?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "You will give a gift to him", not to one who sold himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Elazar holds that this teaches that you give to him, not to his heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why shouldn't his heirs receive the gifts? The Torah calls the slave a worker!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a worker's heirs inherit his wages, a slave's heirs inherit the gifts due to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, R. Elazar learns from the verse that we do not give the gifts to his creditor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Normally, R. Nasan's law applies. This is an exception.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Beraisa (R. Nasan):</span> "He will give to the one he sinned against" - if Reuven owes Shimon, and Shimon owes Levi, we take from Reuven to pay Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim disagree with R. Nasan (so no verse is needed to teach that his law does not apply here).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> How do Chachamim learn about mating the slave with a Shifchah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "If his master will give him a wife", but he may not give to one who sold himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Elazar holds that the verse teaches that the master can force the slave to have children through her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Chachamim learn this from another verse:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "For he worked twice as much as a hired worker" - workers work only by day, but an Eved Ivri works also at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That cannot be! "It is good for him with you" - he (even) eats and drinks as well as you! (Surely, he does not work day and night!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> Rather, the master mates him with a Shifchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> That verse does not prove that the master can force the slave. (We need "if his master will give him a wife" to teach this.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO DOES NOT LEARN THE GEZEIRAH SHAVAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (from Daf 14b, 4:a):</span> Which Tana does not learn the Gezeirah Shavah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Tana of the following Beraisa does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Eliezer ben Yakov) Question:</span> "He will return to his family (in Yovel)" - whom does this discuss?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It does not discuss one who sold himself. This was already taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It does not discuss a Nirtza. This was already taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is a slave sold by Beis Din less than six years before Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If R. Eliezer ben Yakov learned the Gezeirah Shavah, he would not need a verse. He would learn from one who sold himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Really, he learns the Gezeirah Shavah. Still, a verse is needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that one who sold himself goes free (in Yovel), since he did not transgress, but one sold by Beis Din (for stealing) is fined and does not go free. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did the Torah teach that Nirtza goes free?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #2) Question:</span> "A man will return to his inheritance, and to his family (in Yovel)" - whom does this discuss?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It does not discuss one who sold himself. This was already taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It does not discuss one sold by Beis Din. This was already taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it discusses one who became a Nirtza less than six years before Yovel. It teaches that he goes free in Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the verse connote this? (Perhaps this verse discusses one sold by Beis Din, and "he will return to his family", in Beraisa #1, discusses a Nirtza!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava bar Shilo):</span> "A man" alludes to something that applies to a man, not a woman, namely, a Nirtza.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Torah needed to teach about one sold by Beis Din, and about a Nirtza;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only that one sold by Beis Din goes free, one might have thought that that is because he did not desire to stay past his term (but a Nirtza would not go free);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only that a Nirtza goes free, one might have thought that that is because he already served six years (but one sold by Beis Din would not go free).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Torah needed to write "(a Nirtza) will return (in Yovel)", and also "(a Nirtza will serve) forever".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it written only "forever", one might have thought that he never goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it written only "(he) will return (in Yovel)", one might have thought that this is only if Yovel was within six years of becoming a Nirtza; but the extra years of a Nirtza would never exceed his initial term (he would go free after another six years). Therefore, it says that he serves forever, i.e. until Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question (a)):</span> Rebbi does not learn the Gezeirah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "If he (one sold to a Nochri) will not be redeemed through these (relatives)" - he is redeemed (goes free) through relatives, but not through serving six years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One might have thought to learn from a Kal va'Chomer. If one sold himself to a Yisrael, the Torah did not say that his relatives redeem him, but it says that he goes free after six years;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If one sold himself to a Nochri, the Torah says that his relatives redeem him, all the more so he should go free after six years!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"Through these" shows that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> If Rebbi learned the Gezeirah Shavah, he would not say that one who sells himself to a Yisrael is not redeemed by relatives. He would learn from the Gezeirah Shavah that he is!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Really, Rebbi learns the Gezeirah Shavah, but the Torah said "he will redeem him (one sold to a Nochri)", and not one sold to a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>REDEMPTION THROUGH RELATIVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana'im argue with Rebbi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili and R. Akiva disagree:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili):</span> "(If) he will not be redeemed with these" - if relatives redeem him, he goes free. If a stranger redeems him, he serves the stranger;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, if relatives redeem him, he serves them. If a stranger redeems him, he goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili learns from "if he will not be redeemed through these", rather, through another, "he will go free in Yovel".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva disagrees. He explains "if he will not be redeemed", Ela (only) "through these, he will go free in Yovel."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The verse does not say 'only'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, they argue the following. "Or his uncle...will redeem him" refers to redemption through relatives. "Or he will attain (money to redeem himself)" is redemption through himself. "And he will be redeemed" is redemption through others;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili says that the middle of the verse teaches about the beginning. Just like he goes free when he redeems himself, also when relatives redeem him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says that the middle of the verse teaches about the end: just like he goes free when he redeems himself, also when strangers redeem him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did the Torah need to write "through these" (from which R. Akiva derived that if he is redeemed through strangers, he goes free)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the middle of the verse teaches about the beginning and the end, and he goes free whether he is redeemed through relatives or strangers. "Through these" teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is more reasonable to learn like Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili, that "through these" teaches that he goes free when redeemed by relatives! (R. Akiva needed to say it is as if it says 'only'.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> They argue based on reasoning:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili holds that he serves strangers who redeem him. If not, they would not redeem him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva holds that he serves relatives who redeem him. If not, a man would be quick to sell himself to a Nochri, confident that his relatives will redeem him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Chachamim disagree with Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili and R. Akiva. Chachamim say that he goes free whether he is redeemed through relatives or strangers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are the Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like Rebbi, who expounds "through these" differently (to teach that he does not go free after six years;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The middle of the verse "or his uncle...or he will attain" teaches about the beginning and the end.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rebbi learn from "he will go free in Yovel" (since he goes free immediately, no matter who redeems him)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> (If he is not redeemed,) "he will go free in Yovel." This discusses a Nochri under our control.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it applies even if he is not under our control!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the slave will go free only when his master wants to free him!</p>
