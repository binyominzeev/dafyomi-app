<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FOR WHAT DO WE RELY ON CHAZAKAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> We only rely on children clinging to a mother for Terumah, but not for lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We also rely on it for lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This is like R. Yochanan said elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba, citing R. Yochanan):</span> We lash, stone and burn people based on Chazakah, but we don't burn Terumah based on Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We lash people based on Chazakah, like Rav Yehudah taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a woman was established among her neighbors to be a Nidah, her husband is lashed for Bi'ah with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>We stone and burn people based on Chazakah, like Rabah bar Rav Huna taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> If a man and woman and a boy and girl grew up in the same house (we assume the children are from these parents), they can be stoned and burned for Bi'ah of a parent with a child.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> Once, a woman came to Yerushalayim with a boy on her shoulder. She raised him, and had Bi'ah with him. They were stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was not known Vadai that he was her son, but he clung to her (like children cling to their mother).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHAZAKAH OF TAHARAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> We burn Terumah based on Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We don't burn Terumah based on Chazakah</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a child was found near a dough holding a small piece of dough in his hand, the big dough is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, it is Tamei, because a child normally plays (Rashi - in trash heaps, and becomes Tamei; Tosfos - with dough, and he probably touched the dough).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is R. Meir Metaher?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that most children play, and a minority do not. The dough has Chezkas Taharah. We join the minority to the Chazakah; this weakens the majority.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim ignore the minority. The majority overrides the Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> This is the case in which we burn Terumah based on Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is not the case in which we burn Terumah based on Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, what is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If there is a dough in the house, and also Sheratzim (Tamei rodents) and (Tahor) frogs, and pieces of Sheratzim or frogs (we cannot tell which) were found in the dough:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there are more Sheratzim than frogs in the house, the dough is Tamei. If there are more frogs, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> (In cases of Safek Tum'ah in which we cannot ask the involved parties what happened because they lack understanding, we rule that it is Tahor.) In two cases in which the parties lack understanding, Chachamim were stringent to consider them as if they have understanding (so we are stringent in a Reshus ha'Yachid) - a child and another case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case of the child is when he is near a dough (like above).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the other case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If in a house there are a dough, chickens and Tamei liquids, and there are holes in the dough from pecking, we suspend the dough. We neither eat it nor burn it.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">80b----------------------------------------80b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> This refers only to white liquids. If the liquids were red, (the dough is Tahor, for) if there were drops in the dough, this would be noticed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps they were absorbed in the dough!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Correction (R. Yochanan):</span> Rather, if the liquids are clear (a reflection can be seen in them, then the dough is Tahor, for) drops in the dough would be noticed. If the liquids are cloudy, we suspend the dough.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SECLUSION OF MEN WITH WOMEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man may not be secluded with two women, but a woman may be secluded with two men;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon says, even one man may be secluded with two women. If his wife is with him; they may even sleep together in an inn, since his wife will guard him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A male may be secluded with his mother or daughter, and sleep with her without clothes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When they grow up, they must wear clothes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is it forbidden for a man to be secluded with two women?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Tana d'Vei Eliyahu):</span> It is because women are easily enticed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that seclusion is forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan) Question:</span> "If your brother, the son of your mother will entice you (to serve idolatry)" - do only maternal brothers entice?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, this hints that a man may be secluded with his mother, but not with other Arayos (forbidden women).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the simple understanding of the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It teaches a Chidush. Not only should one not heed enticement of a paternal brother, who hates him (for he decreases his inheritance), rather, one should not heed even enticement of a maternal brother, who loves him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike Aba Sha'ul:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a baby dies within 30 days, it may be carried out for burial without a coffin, with one woman and two men, but not with two women and one man;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Aba Sha'ul says, it is permitted even with two women and one man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Our Mishnah is even like Aba Sha'ul. At a time of mourning, the Yetzer Ra is subdued.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Chachamim hold like R. Yitzchak.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Al Mah Yis'onen Adam Chai Gever Al Chata'av" - even at a time of Aninus (mourning), one must be Misgaver on (overpower) his Yetzer Ra, or else it will be Misgaver on him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Aba Sha'ul must explain differently. The verse discusses one who complains about Hash-m's ways. "Can a living man (justifiably) complain? Did he overcome his (temptations to) sin?!" It suffices that he is alive!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Chachamim learn from a particular case (in which people pretended to be engaged in burying a child, and were Mezanah) that we cannot permit seclusion even at a time of mourning.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SECLUSION WITH MORAL MEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman may be secluded with two men.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> This is only with moral men. She may not be secluded even with 10 immoral men.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There was a case in which 10 immoral men took a woman out in a coffin to sin with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> Ten men will gather to steal a heavy beam. They are not ashamed of each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Mishnah):</span> We send two Chachamim with a man taking a Sotah (his wife) to Yerushalayim to make her drink, lest he have Bi'ah with her on the way.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We must send Chachamim, not commoners!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We need Chachamim so they can warn him (that if he has Bi'ah with her, the water will not test her. If not for this, perhaps even immoral men could be sent.)</p>
