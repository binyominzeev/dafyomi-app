<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ORLAH OF CHUTZ LA'ARETZ</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Shmuel said that both Mishnayos (Orlah and Kilayim) should say the same thing. Either both say 'as long as you don't see the seller pick (Vadai Isur)', or both say 'as long as you don't pick it yourself.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Mar Brei d'Ravna learns the lenient version (in both cases, one may see the seller pick it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Levi asked Shmuel (in Chutz la'Aretz) to pick fruit (presumably Orlah) for him. Levi would not know that it is Vadai Orlah, so it would be permitted to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Avya and Rabah bar bar Chanan would supply each other with Orlah of Chutz La'Aretz (neither was Vadai that he received Orlah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Eifa and Avimi):</span> Orlah does not apply in Chutz La'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When R. Yochanan heard this, he told Rav Yehudah to publicize (in the city of Eifa and Avimi) that Vadai Orlah (of Chutz La'Aretz) must be destroyed. Safek Orlah is permitted, but this should not be publicized;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The fruits of Eifa and Avimi must be buried;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yochanan cursed anyone who would say that Orlah does not apply in Chutz La'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom do Eifa and Avimi hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi, citing R. Eliezer):</span> Orlah does not apply in Chutz La'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> Even Chadash applies in Chutz La'Aretz (as well as Orlah and Kilayim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> The word 'even' must be deleted from the text.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> A tradition from Moshe from Sinai forbids Orlah in Chutz La'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira - Mishnah):</span> Safek Orlah in Eretz Yisrael is forbidden. In Surya, it is permitted. In Chutz La'Aretz, you may buy it, as long as you don't see the seller picking Vadai Orlah. (If Orlah of Chutz la'Aretz is forbidden mid'Oraisa, we must be stringent about a Safek!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Asi):</span> The tradition forbids only Vadai Orlah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KILAYIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> One is lashed mid'Oraisa for Kilayim in Chutz La'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar bar Asi - Mishnah):</span> Kilayim in Chutz La'Aretz is forbidden mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Asi refers to grafting diverse species of trees.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> "Guard my statutes" - that I previously commanded (to Bnei Noach);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Do not crossbreed your animal, do not sow your field Kilayim" - the Isur in your field is (grafting, which overtly mixes two things) like the Isur of (crossbreeding) animals);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like crossbreeding animals applies in Chutz La'Aretz (it does not depend on the land), also grafting trees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Your field" connotes in Eretz Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches that planting Kilayim is forbidden only in Eretz Yisrael. (Tosfos - this refers to Kil'ei ha'Kerem which we might have learned from a Kal va'Chomer. No verse is needed to permit (in Chutz la'Aretz) Kilayim not in a vineyard, for it depends on the land.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Chanan and Rav Anan saw a man planting Kilayim in Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Anan:</span> We should excommunicate him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chanan:</span> You do not know the Halachah (he is not transgressing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>They saw a man planting wheat and barley in a vineyard in Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Anan:</span> We should excommunicate him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chanan:</span> You do not know the Halachah. The Halachah follows R. Yoshiyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yoshiyah):</span> One transgresses Kil'ei ha'Kerem only if he plants a grape seed and two other species together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Yosef mixed diverse seeds and planted them together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> Kilayim applies in Chutz la'Aretz mid'Rabanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> That refers to Kil'ei ha'Kerem, not Kil'ei Zera'im (diverse seeds not involving grapes or a vineyard).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since one may not benefit from Kil'ei ha'Kerem in Eretz Yisrael, Chachamim forbade such Kilayim in Chutz la'Aretz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may benefit from Kil'ei Zera'im in Eretz Yisrael, so Chachamim did not forbid it in Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rav Yosef):</span> Even Kil'ei Zera'im is forbidden in Chutz la'Aretz. Rav planted his garden in distinct patches.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This was to avoid Kilayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> Had he planted like the Mishnah suggests (to maximize the distinct species within an area without transgressing Kilayim), that would be correct;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he didn't plant that way, he merely planted in patches so it should look nice, or for ease of harvesting.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE REWARD OF MITZVOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Hash-m bestows good to anyone who does a Mitzvah, and lengthen his days. The person will inherit the land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The opposite applies if he does not do the Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction (Mishnah #1):</span> For the following Mitzvos, one is rewarded with dividends in this world, and the principal remains for him in the world to come: honoring parents, bestowing Chesed, hosting guests, and making Shalom between people. Talmud Torah is equivalent to all of them together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> Our Mishnah teaches that if anyone does one Mitzvah beyond his merits (that previously weighed equally against his sins), Hash-m will bestow good to him, like one who fulfilled the entire Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Regarding the Mitzvos listed Mishnah #1, he gets these rewards for doing one Mitzvah alone!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Shemayah):</span> No. The Mitzvos listed can tip the scales if a person's merits (with that Mitzvah) equal his sins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If one's merits outweigh his sins, Hash-m does evil to him. He will be punished like (is proper for) one who burned the entire Torah without a remnant;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one's sins outweigh his merits, Hash-m will do good to him. He will be rewarded like (is proper for) one who fulfilled every letter of the Torah. (This is unlike our Mishnah, which says that one is rewarded for Mitzvos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> (Our Mishnah teaches that) Hash-m prepares him for a good day or a bad day (in the world to come. If one's merits and sins were equal and he did a Mitzvah, Hash-m punishes him in this world for his sins, so he will enjoy the world to come. If he did not do the Mitzvah, Hash-m pays him in this world for his Mitzvos, so he will not enjoy the world to come.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Beraisa is like R. Yakov, who says that reward for a Mitzvah cannot come in this world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yakov):</span> For any Mitzvah whose reward in mentioned in the Torah, one merits Techiyas ha'Mesim (revival of the dead).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding honoring parents it says "in order that your days will be lengthened and it will be good for you". Regarding sending the mother bird away from her young it says "in order that it will be good for you and your days will be lengthened."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a man asked his son to bring him chicks from the top of a building, and the son obeyed, chasing away the mother away before taking the chicks, he fulfilled both Mitzvos. If the son fell and died on the way down, where is his reward (length of days)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that the reward promised is in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps (the reward is in this world, so) such an incident would never happen!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yakov witnessed such an incident.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the son was thinking about (sexual) transgression!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m does not punish for a bad intention (that was not carried out) - "if I saw sin in my heart, Hash-m will not hear,"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the son was thinking about idolatry - "in order to trap Bnei Yisrael in their hearts" (one is punished for thoughts of idolatry as if he served it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If reward for a Mitzvah would come in this world, the Mitzvah would have guarded him from having such thoughts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could such an incident occur? R. Elazar taught that those engaged in Mitzvos are not harmed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This occurred on the way back, after he did the Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Elazar taught that those engaged in Mitzvos are not harmed, not on their way to the Mitzvah nor on the way back!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The ladder was rickety; it was clearly dangerous.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not rely on miracles in dangerous situations. "Shmuel said, how can I go (to anoint David)? Sha'ul will hear and kill me!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Had Acher expounded the verse like R. Yakov, he would not have become a heretic.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he become a heretic?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> He also saw a son fulfill these two Mitzvos and die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer:</span> He saw a pig dragging the tongue of Chutzpis the translator (a great Chacham and Tzadik killed by the Romans).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It appeared to him that there is no reward for Torah and Mitzvos, so he became a heretic.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>REWARD FOR NOT SINNING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Tuvi bar Rav Kisna - Mishnah):</span> Hash-m does good to anyone who does a Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is only if he does an action!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> One who refrains from sinning is rewarded like one who did a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Beraisa discusses one who was tempted to sin and overcame it, like R. Chanina bar Papa.</p>
