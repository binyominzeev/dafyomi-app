<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SHELUCHIM FOR KIDUSHIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man can be Mekadesh a woman by himself, or through a Shali'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A woman can become Mekudeshes to a man by herself, or through a Shali'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A man can be Mekadesh his daughter, when she is a Na'arah, by himself, or through a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If one can be Mekadesh a woman through a Shali'ach, obviously he can do this himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The Mishnah teaches that it is a bigger Mitzvah to do it himself than through a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For this reason, Rav Safra and Rava themselves used to salt a head and a fish to honor Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer:</span> One may not be Mekadesh a woman through a Shali'ach (if he could be Mekadesh her himself)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may not be Mekadesh a woman without seeing her. Perhaps he will see in her something displeasing, and despise her, and transgress "you will love your fellow man like yourself"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Yosef's teaching applies to the Seifa, 'a woman can become Mekudeshes by herself, or through a Shali'ach.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she can do so through a Shali'ach, obviously she can do so by herself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It is a bigger Mitzvah to do so herself than through a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>For this reason, Rav Safra and Rava themselves used to salt a head and a fish to honor Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A woman may become Mekudeshes through a Shali'ach, for she will love her husband (even if she did not see him beforehand);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> A woman prefers to be married than to live alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man can be Mekadesh his daughter when she is a Na'arah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is only when she is a Na'arah, but not when she is a minor. This supports Rav:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may not be Mekadesh his daughter when she is young, until she matures and says whom she wants to marry.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE SOURCE FOR MAKING A SHALI'ACH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one can make a Shali'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> The Torah expresses divorce using the verb Shalach (to send), to teach that a man can make a Shali'ach (agent);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>('V'Shilchah' with a Mapik Hei (it has a dot inside) means 'he will send her'. Without a Mapik Hei, it means 'she will send'.) We expound the latter to teach that a woman can make a Shali'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The repetition of "v'Shilchah" teaches that a Shali'ach can make a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about divorce. What is the source for (Shelichus for) Kidushin?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from divorce.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps we learn only for divorce, for divorce works against her will!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "She will leave... and she will be (Mekudeshes)" equates divorce and Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like he can make a Shali'ach to divorce, also to be Mekadesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told his Shali'ach Shimon 'separate Terumah', Shimon should separate as much as Reuven usually takes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon does not know how much Reuven usually separates, he should take the average amount, one part in 50;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Shimon took off between one part in 40 and one part in 60, the Terumah is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Shali'ach can separate Terumah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from divorce.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn Terumah, which has Kedushah, from divorce, which is Chulin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Also you (will take Terumah)" teaches that a Shali'ach can take Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Torah teach about Shelichus regarding divorce? We could learn from Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from Terumah, for Terumah can be separated through thought alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Korban Pesach was lost. The group (that jointly owned it) sent one member (Reuven) to find it. He found it and slaughtered it. The rest of the group took another animal and slaughtered it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven slaughtered first, all eat from the animal he slaughtered (he was their Shali'ach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Shali'ach can slaughter Kodshim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from divorce and Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from these, for they are like Chulin compared to Kodshim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Korchah) Question:</span> Why does it say "all of Yisrael will slaughter (the Pesach)"? Only one person slaughters (each Korban)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that we attribute a Shali'ach's actions to the one who appointed him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHY THE TORAH NEEDED TO TEACH EACH CASE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Torah teach about Shelichus regarding divorce and Terumah? We could learn from Pesach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from Pesach, for most matters of Kodshim (are Kosher only through Kohanim, and) must be done through Sheluchim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We showed that it did not suffice to teach about Shelichus in one case (we could not learn the other two from it). Perhaps the Torah could have taught two, and we would learn the third from them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can learn Kodshim from the others!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They are like Chulin compared to Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can learn divorce from the others!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from Kodshim and Terumah, for they take effect through mere thought.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can learn Terumah from the others!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we can learn Terumah from divorce and Kodshim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Torah need to write "also you"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches like R. Yanai taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> "Also you" - just like you are party to the covenant (of circumcision), also your Sheluchim must be.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know this without the verse!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> A slave cannot be a Shali'ach to receive a Get of divorce, because Kidushin and divorce do not apply to him. (Likewise, Terumah applies only to Yisre'elim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kidushin and divorce do not apply to slaves at all. A Nochri can separate Terumah on his own produce, so one might have thought he can be a Shali'ach for (a Yisrael to separate) Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri or Kusi separated Terumah, it becomes Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Shimon (who says that their separation of Terumah is invalid), what do we learn from "also you"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri separated Terumah, and it became mixed with Chulin, it forbids the mixture. If a non-Kohen ate such Terumah, he must compensate for what he ate and add a fifth;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, neither of these two laws apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn "you (can separate Terumah)", but sharecroppers cannot, nor partners, guardians, or anyone who separates from produce that is not his;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that we exclude even a Shali'ach. "Also you" teaches that Sheluchim can separate Terumah.</p>
