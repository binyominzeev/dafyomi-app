<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BAD LINEAGES THAT WIDELY INTERMARRIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama bar Chanina):</span> When Hash-m purifies families (reveals who has proper lineage), He will begin with the Leviyim (i.e. Kohanim) - "He will sit like one who purifies silver, and purify the Leviyim like gold and silver, and they will bring Minchah offerings b'Tzedakah (rightfully)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Money permits Mamzerim - "the Purifier (Hash-m) will sit, and money will purify." (Rashi - if Pesulim intermarried with many families due to their money, Hash-m will be Machshir them all, lest He disqualify those who intermarried with them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does he explain "they will bring Minchah offerings b'Tzedakah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> Hash-m was charitable to Yisrael, to permit disqualified families that became mixed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> All lands are like dough (mixed with Pesulim) compared to Eretz Yisrael. Eretz Yisrael is like dough compared to Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>In Rebbi's time, people wanted to say that Bavel is like dough compared to Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi (who was from Bavel):</span> You cause problems for me! R. Chanina bar Chama can deal with you.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Chama, citing Rebbi Yosi):</span> All lands are like dough compared to Eretz Yisrael. Eretz Yisrael is like dough compared to Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>In R. Pinchas' time, people wanted to say that Bavel is like dough compared to Eretz Yisrael. He told his servants to be ready to quickly take him out in a carriage after he speaks in the Beis Medrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Pinchas:</span> The Torah does not require slaughter of birds.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>While people were thinking about this, he said 'all lands are like dough compared to Eretz Yisrael. Eretz Yisrael is like dough compared to Bavel.' His servants rushed him out. People chased him, but could not catch him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>People started investigating lineages. They found that there were problems in powerful families (who would kill them if they revealed this). They stopped investigating.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We could reveal the problematic families in Eretz Yisrael but giants of the generation are involved (and this would disgrace them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds like R. Yitzchak, who said that we do not separate from a problematic family that intermarried with many others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> Ben Tziyon (a powerful and important person) caused people to accept (intermarry with) one family of improper lineage, and caused people to stay away from a proper family;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Eliyahu will (respectively) disqualify and purify such families, push away and draw close, because people know their true status;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a family (that people thought is Kosher) intermarried widely, it will not be disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There was another family (not mentioned in the Mishnah) that was accepted by force. Chachamim did not reveal its name, but they passed on the name to their Talmidim and children once every seven years. Some say that they did so twice every seven years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is more reasonable to say once every seven years:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'I will be a Nazir if I do not reveal improper families', he must be a Nazir. He may not reveal. (This shows how much we must avoid revealing about families.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SPECIAL NAMES OF HASH-M</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Chachamim pass on (the true pronunciation of) Hash-m's four letter name to their Talmidim and children once every seven years. Some say, they do so twice every seven years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is more reasonable to say once every seven years - "this is My name l'Olam (forever)" is written missing a 'Vov', so we may read it Le'alem (to conceal).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava planned to reveal the name in his class. An elder remarked 'it is written like Le'alem.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Avina):</span> One verse says "this is My name" and another verse says "this is My remembrance"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m's name is not pronounced like it is written. It is written with Yud-Kei, but it is pronounced like Aleph-Dalet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> At first, they would pass on Hash-m's 12-letter name to everyone. When base people became widespread, they would pass it on only to virtuous Kohanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The virtuous Kohanim would say it quietly. It was drowned out by the voices of the other Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Tarfon):</span> I once came close and heard the Kohen Gadol say it amidst the other Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The 42-letter name is taught only to someone virtuous, humble, middle aged, who does not get angry or drunk or harbor resentment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anyone who knows the name and guards it in Taharah is beloved in Heaven and earth, people fear him, and he inherits this world and the next.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE LINEAGE OF BAVEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> In Bavel, we assume the lineage is fine in every place, unless we know about a problem;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In other lands (excluding Eretz Yisrael), we assume that the lineage is bad, unless we know that it is good;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In Eretz Yisrael, areas established to be bad are bad, and areas established to be good are good.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> 'Areas established to be bad are bad' implies that Stam (without a Chazakah), we assume that a place is good;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Areas established to be good are good' implies that Stam, we assume that a place is bad!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna bar Tachlifa):</span> To get married, Stam, we assume that a place is bad (one must check first.) To force one to divorce, Stam, we assume that a place is good (we do not force without proof of a Psul).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">71b----------------------------------------71b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If one speaks like someone from Bavel, we assume that he is of Bavel (a woman may marry him without checking).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nowadays, people speak like this to trick people, so we cannot rely on this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yochanan wanted to marry his daughter to Ze'iri. Ze'iri did not want to marry her (since he was from Bavel, of superior lineage), so he was avoiding R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once, they were walking and encountered a puddle. R. Zeira carried R. Yochanan across on his shoulders.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> You accept our Torah (of Eretz Yisrael, and consider me to be your Rebbi). Why don't you accept our daughters?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Do you think that our Mishnah (10 lineages...) teaches that all the Pesulim left Bavel? No! Just like some people of good lineage remained, also some Pesulim remained!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yochanan overlooked R. Elazar's teaching, that Ezra did not leave Bavel until he made it like clean flour (he took all the Pesulim with him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Ula saw that Rav Yehudah's son had grown up, but was not married.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> Why don't you marry off your son?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Where can I find a girl of proper lineage? (Pnei Yehoshua - Rav Yehudah (72b) said that Chachamim hold that all lands have Chezkas Kashrus (and the Halachah follows them)! He held that his own lineage was Vadai, and he desired a similar girl for his son.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> Who can guarantee that we ourselves are fine? Those who destroyed the Mikdash "raped women in Tziyon." Perhaps we descend from them!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (Even so, we are Kosher, for) the child of a Yisre'elis from a Nochri or slave is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Still, there are Mamzerim among Yisrael from adultery!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi Yosi bar Chanina):</span> "Those who lie on ivory beds and Seruchim (overhang, or stink) on their beds" refers to people who urinate naked in front of their beds.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Avahu):</span> For this "they will be the first to be exiled"?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Rather, the verse refers to people who eat together, stick their beds together and swap wives. They make their beds stink with others' semen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> What should we do?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> Look for a family that is silent when confronted;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In Eretz Yisrael, when families quarrel, the first family to be silent is considered to have better lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The best lineage in Bavel is the families that are silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav came to Bei Shichla and checked them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He checked their lineage (by inquiring about their parents...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he checked which families are silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If you see two men quarrel, one of them has bad lineage, and Hash-m is preventing them from intermarrying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If you see two families quarreling - one of them has bad lineage, Hash-m is preventing them from intermarrying.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE BOUNDARIES OF BAVEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa Sava):</span> Bavel's lineage is clean. That of Meishan is all disqualified. Some of Madai is disqualified. Most of Eilam is disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What area is considered Bavel (past the Chidekel river)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It is until the river Azak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> It is until the river Yu'ani.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Between the Pras and Chidekel rivers, how far along the Diglas (i.e. the Chidekel) does Bavel extend (on the south)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It is until Bagda and Avna.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> It is until, but not including Mushchani.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Chiya bar Aba said in the name of Shmuel that Mushchani is the elite of lineage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Shmuel said 'until and including Mushchani.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How far along the Diglas does Bavel extend (in the north)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer: (Rav Shmuel):</span> It is until the lower Afmaya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How far along the Pras does Bavel extend (on the south)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1: (Rav):</span> It is until Aka.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> It is until the bridge of Pras.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is until the Gizma bridge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Abaye (some say - Rav Yosef) vehemently opposed Rav's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> All the more so, he should oppose Shmuel's opinion (which is more lenient)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, he vehemently opposed Rav's opinion, and all the more so Shmuel's opinion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Shmuel is stricter than Rav. In Shmuel's day, the bridge of Pras was before Aka. Later, it was rebuilt past Aka.</p>
