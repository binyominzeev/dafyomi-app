<p class="dedicationbox">KIDUSHIN 52 - Dedicated by Mordechai and Shifra Gitt (RBS, Israel) in memory of their deceased family members. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RAVA IS REFUTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Tivyomi's Beraisa):</span> If Reuven has five sons and David has five daughters, and Reuven was Mekadesh 'one of your daughters to one of my sons', each daughter needs a Get from each son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a brother died, each daughter needs a Get from each remaining brother, and one Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps here also, they knew at the time of Kidushin, and forgot later.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He said 'one of your daughters to one of my sons'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rava is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Whenever Abaye and Rava argue, the Halachah follows Rava, except for six Halachos. The acronym for these Halachos is 'Ya'AL K'GaM'. (K is for Kidushin that forbids Bi'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KIDUSHIN WITH STOLEN MONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A case occurred with five women...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We learn four laws from this case, but one of these is not clear.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one was Mekadesh with Peros Shemitah, she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one was Mekadesh with stolen property, even if it is her property, she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We learn this from the fact that the Mishnah needed to say that the fruits were of Shemitah (and therefore Hefker), even though the women owned the field. Had it not been Shemitah, they would not be Mekudashos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Sarah can be a Shali'ach to receive Kidushin for Leah, even if through this they become co-wives;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Mishnah also teaches the law of Kidushin that forbids the husband to have Bi'ah with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav consider this something we clearly learn from the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was unsure if we explain as Abaye or like Rava (above).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Did Rav really say this?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan himself taught that if Reuven stole something from Shimon, and Shimon did not despair from getting it back, neither of them can make it Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Reuven cannot, because it is not his. Shimon cannot, because he has no control over it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>(Likewise, Reuven cannot be Mekadesh with it, because it is not his.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan was surprised that Rav agreed with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one was Mekadesh a woman with extorted or stolen property, or he grabbed money from her hand and was Mekadesh her, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he was Mekadesh her with property he stole from her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa says that he grabbed money from her hand. This implies that the Reisha discusses property stolen from others!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa explains the Reisha;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was Mekadesh her with extorted or stolen property, e.g. he grabbed money from her hand and was Mekadesh her...</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah discusses property stolen from the women, and Rav said that they would not be Mekudashos if it was not Shemitah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav discusses a case in which there were no Shiduchin. The Beraisa discusses when there were Shiduchin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>A woman was washing her feet. Reuven came and grabbed money from Shimon. He threw it to her and said 'you are Mekudeshes to me with this.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> No one is concerned for R. Shimon's opinion, that one that is openly robbed immediately despairs of getting it back (for he saw the Gazlan. Therefore, she is not Mekudeshes.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MONEY TAKEN WITHOUT ASKING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A sharecropper took a handful of onions and was Mekadesh a woman with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> The landowner did not agree that you may take these. (She is not Mekudeshes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This applies only to a handful. If he took a bundle, the landowner surely agrees (for he will likewise take a bundle. They are partners in the Peros.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A beer brewer was Mekadesh a woman with the dregs of beer. The owner found out and said 'why didn't you give her good beer?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The concept of 'why didn't you take better ones?' was said only about Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Sometimes, one can separate Terumah without being appointed by the owner. Reuven entered Shimon's field, gathered fruit, and separated Terumah without asking Shimon. If Shimon suspects that Reuven wanted to steal, the Terumah is invalid. If not, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know whether or not he suspects him of theft?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If when Shimon sees him he asks 'why didn't you take better ones?', if there really are better Peros, he does not suspect him of theft. If there are no better Peros, he suspects him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Shimon added on more, in either case the Terumah is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Regarding the brewer, the owner said 'why didn't you give better?' because he was embarrassed to say that he does not consent!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>KIDUSHIN WITH KODSHIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man was Mekadesh with Chelko (the share of Kodshim that he received), whether of Kodshei Kodoshim (that only Kohanim may eat) or of Kodshim Kalim, the Kidushin is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, if a man was Mekadesh with Ma'aser Sheni, whether he was Shogeg (he was unaware that it was Ma'aser Sheni) or Mezid, the Kidushin is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, if he was Shogeg, the Kidushin is invalid. If he was Mezid, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir says, if a man was Mekadesh with Hekdesh b'Mezid, the Kidushin is valid. If he was Shogeg, it is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, if he was Shogeg, the Kidushin is valid. If he was Mezid, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah is not like Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili):</span> "If one will be Mo'el (benefit from Hekdesh) in Hash-m (and deny his fellowman)" includes (for Me'ilah) Kodshim Kalim, which belong to the owner (and also pertain to Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Mishnah can be like Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili said that they belong to the owner only when they are alive, but not after they are slaughtered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are considered Hash-m's. The owner is allowed to eat from Hash-m's table.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If one was Mekadesh with Chelko (i.e. after it was slaughtered), whether of Kodshei Kodoshim or Kodshim Kalim, the Kidushin is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Sumchus):</span> If one was Mekadesh with Chelko, whether of Kodshei Kodoshim or Kodshim Kalim, the Kidushin is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rebbi Yehudah):</span> (If Kodshei Kodoshim leave the Azarah, they are disqualified and worthless.) Why would a woman be in the Azarah to receive Kidushin?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi Yosi:</span> If she made a Shali'ach to receive Kidushin, or she forced her way in, we must know the Halachah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi Yehudah):</span> (If a man was Mekadesh with Kodshei Kodoshim or Kodshim Kalim,) the Kidushin is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rebbi Yosi says, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They both learn from "this will be to you from the Kodshei Kodoshim from the fire." Rebbi Yehudah explains "to you" - for all your needs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi Yosi explains, they are like "fire". Just like the Mizbe'ach's share is consumed by fire, the share of Kohanim is (solely) for consumption.</p>
