<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A WOMAN MEKUDESHES TO MANY MEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> According to Rav, if Reuven said 'you are Mekudeshes to me from now and after 30 days', then David said 'you are Mekudeshes to me from now and after 20 days', then Moshe said 'you are Mekudeshes to me from now and after 10 days' (and she wants to marry someone else), she needs a Get only from the first and last men, not from the middle man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This is because either way we judge it, she is Mekudeshes to the first or last man. If 'and after so and so days' is a Tenai, she is Mekudeshes to the first man. If it is a retraction, she is Mekudeshes to the last man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that 'from now and after 30 days' has both connotations, and there is an (independent) doubt about what each man meant, so she needs a Get from every man;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye teaches that this is not so. It means the same for every man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> R. Yochanan says, in this way ('you are Mekudeshes to me from now and after 30 days', 'from now and after 20 days'...) she can be Mekudeshes to any number of men.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mesharshiya Brei d'Rav Ami):</span> R. Yochanan holds that each man was Mekadesh her in a way that leaves room for another man to be Mekadesh her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanina - Beraisa):</span> If a man said 'you are divorced) from today and after my death', the Get is valid and invalid. If he died (without children), she does Chalitzah, not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This supports Rav (we are unsure whether 'after my death' is a Tenai or a retraction).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This does not refute Shmuel. He says that the Beraisa is like Chachamim. Shmuel holds like Rebbi (that it is surely a condition).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>But according to R. Yochanan, he leaves a remnant. Such a divorce is totally invalid. Yibum should be permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> A Get and death of the husband both permit a woman. Death permits the remnant that the Get did not permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> A Get prevents her from doing Yibum. Death brings her to do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Rather, the Get is totally invalid. Mid'Oraisa, she may do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim decreed that she must do Chalitzah (not Yibum), lest women do Yibum after a Get given 'from today if I die' (which is valid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should decree to require Chalitzah after a Get 'from today if I die', lest women come to remarry without Chalitzah after a Get 'from today and after I die' (which is invalid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If we decree that she do Chalitzah, women may come to do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should likewise decree that she should not do Chalitzah with a Get 'from today and after I die', lest she come to do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mid'Oraisa, she may do Yibum. This is forbidden only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KIDUSHIN ON CONDITION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Mekadesh a woman 'Al Menas (on condition) that I will give you 200 Zuz', she is Mekudeshes, and he must give her;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'Al Menas that I will give you within 30 days', if he gave within 30 days, she is Mekudeshes. If not, she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he said 'Al Menas that I have 200 Zuz', she is Mekudeshes if he has;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he said 'Al Menas that I will show you 200 Zuz', she is Mekudeshes if he shows her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he shows her (other people's money) on the table (on which he changes money for a profit), she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> ('She is Mekudeshes' immediately,) and he must give her;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> '(She will be Mekudeshes)' when he gives her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Huna says that she is Mekudeshes immediately. Giving is mere fulfillment of the Tenai;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Yehudah says that she is Mekudeshes when he gives. That is when the Kidushin takes place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the practical difference between the opinions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If she accepted Kidushin from Shimon before Reuven paid her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rav Huna, Shimon's Kidushin is Batel (if Reuven eventually gives). According to Rav Yehudah, she is Mekudeshes to Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>They argued similarly about divorce.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven divorced his wife 'Al Menas that you will give to me 200 Zuz', she is divorced, and she must give him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> ('She is divorced' immediately,) and she must give him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> '(She will be divorced)' when she gives him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rav Huna says that she is divorced immediately. Giving is mere fulfillment of the Tenai;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rav Yehudah says, the divorce occurs only when she gives him.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the practical difference between the opinions?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the Get was torn or lost before she gave him:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to Rav Huna, the Get is valid (if she eventually gives). According to Rav Yehudah, she is not divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>They needed to teach the argument in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had they taught only about Kidushin, one might have thought that that is when Rav Huna said that it works immediately, for he comes close to her. Regarding divorce, he separates from her. Perhaps he intends that it take effect only after she gives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had they taught only about divorce, one might have thought that that is when Rav Huna said that it works immediately, for he is not ashamed to demand the money from her. Regarding Kidushin, she is ashamed to demand the money from him, perhaps they do not intend that it take effect until he gives. (Even though he gains if she never demands the money, he knows that she is reluctant to accept Kidushin that takes effect from now due to her shame to demand the money.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Beraisa):</span> Reuven divorced his wife 'Al Menas that you will give to me 200 Zuz', even if the Get was torn or lost before she gave him, she is divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She may not remarry until she gives the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven divorced his wife 'Al Menas that you will give to me 200 Zuz', and he died:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she gave the money, she is exempt from Yibum (and Chalitzah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she did not give, she is falls to Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, she may give the money to one of his heirs (and she will be exempt from Yibum).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> They argue only about whether giving to an heir fulfills 'you will give to me'. All agree that she is divorced immediately if the condition is ever fulfilled!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> These Beraisos are like Rebbi. Chachamim argue with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rebbi):</span> Saying 'Al Menas' is like saying 'from now'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> In Bavel, we used to say (like Rav Yehudah) that Chachamim argue with Rebbi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Eretz Yisrael, they said in the name of R. Yochanan that all agree that saying 'Al Menas' is like saying 'from now';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue only about 'from today and after (my) death.'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one gave a Get 'from today and after death', she is divorced and not divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rebbi says, such a Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Yehudah, Rebbi and Chachamim also argue about 'Al Menas.' Why did the Beraisa explain the argument about 'from today and after death', and not about 'Al Menas'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows the extremity of Rebbi. Even regarding 'from today and after (my) death', the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa should explain the argument regarding 'Al Menas that', to show the extremity of Chachamim (even 'Al Menas' is not a Get)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to show the extremity of the lenient opinion.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN IN DOUBT WHETHER THE CONDITION IS FULFILLED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'Al Menas that I have 200 Zuz'...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest he has!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We are concerned lest he has 200 Zuz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means that she is not definitely Mekudeshes. Indeed, she is Safek Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'Al Menas that I will show you 200 Zuz' (and he showed her others' money on the table, she is not Mekudeshes).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> She intended to see his money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he showed her money on the table, she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he profits with the money. Even so, she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'Al Menas that I have a Beis Kor (a field in which 30 Se'ah of seed is normally sown) of dirt', she is Mekudeshes, on condition that he has;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'Al Menas that I have in Ploni (a place)', she is Mekudeshes only if he has there.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah says that she is not Vadai Mekudeshes. Indeed, she is Safek Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Mishnah need to teach this regarding money, and also regarding land?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it taught only about money, one might have thought that this is because it is easy to conceal money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding land, we would not be concerned. Surely if he had land, we would know about it! The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
