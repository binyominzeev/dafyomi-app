<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PLACES IN WHICH NO DECREE WAS MADE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (Reish Lakish):</span> Is the market of Azah considered outside Azah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> In Tzur, Yisraelim leave pots on stovetops next to pots of Nochrim, and Chachamim are not concerned. (Here also, the market is considered outside, and it is permitted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'Chachamim were not concerned'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> They were not concerned lest the Nochri put Neveilah (a Torah Isur) into the Yisrael's pot when the Yisrael turned away - here also, they are not concerned lest the money (that the Nochri pays) is forbidden mid'Oraisa (Rashi - because it was offered to idolatry; R. Tam - because it was designated to buy things for idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> They were not concerned lest the Nochri cooked the Yisrael's food (which is forbidden mid'Rabanan). Here also, they are not concerned lest the Nochri from the city celebrates the festival of the outskirts. (If he did, it would be forbidden mid'Rabanan to sell to him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rabah bar Ula):</span> They were not concerned lest liquid from the Nochri's pot splashed into the Yisrael's pot (a minor concern, since splashing is uncommon, and even when it splashes, it is Batel). Here also, they are not concerned for the three days before the festival (but the day of the festival is forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS FORBIDDEN SINCE THEY MAY AROUSE SUSPICION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> May one travel to the city?...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One may not enter a city in which they serve idolatry, or go from it to another city;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, if the road also leads to another city, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If a thorn got stuck in one's foot in front of idolatry, he may not bend to extract it, for it would look like he bows to the idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it will not be seen, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If his coins fell and scattered in front of idolatry, he may not bend to pick them up, for it would look like he bows to the idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it will not be seen, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If a stream flows in front of idolatry, one may not bend down to drink, for it would look like he bows to the idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it will not be seen, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>One may not put one's mouth next to the mouth of a fountain (made in the image of a person) to drink the water, for it would look like he kisses idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it will not be seen, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Similarly:</span> one may not put one's mouth next to a pipe attached to the ground (and drink), due to the danger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'if it will not be seen'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> No one will see him do this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that anything forbidden due to suspicion, is forbidden even in private!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it will not seem like he bows (or kisses).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>We needed to teach all these cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had we taught only about a thorn, one might have thought that it is forbidden because he can go elsewhere and remove it, but when his coins fell, he is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had we taught only about coins, one might have thought that we are stringent about money, but regarding a thorn which causes pain, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had we taught only these two cases, one might have thought that we are stringent there, but we permit regarding a stream, for if he does not drink he will die (Rashi; Me'iri - could die later).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DANGERS THAT ONE MUST AVOID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the fountain be taught?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It introduces the law that one may not put one's mouth next to a pipe and drink, due to the danger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the danger?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He might swallow a leech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not drink directly with his mouth, or by holding the water in one hand, from rivers or lakes (for he cannot properly check it for leeches). If he does so (and dies), he is responsible for his own death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This supports R. Chanina.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> If someone swallowed a water leech, one may heat up water for him on Shabbos (he is in mortal danger);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A case occurred, and R. Nechemyah permitted this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Until the water is warm, he should swallow vinegar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> If someone swallowed a wasp, he will not survive. He should drink a Revi'is of strong vinegar. This might prolong his life long enough to command who will receive his property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not drink water at night (when he cannot see), for this is dangerous. If he does so, he is held accountable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the danger?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned for a Shed responsible for Sanverim (blindness).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">If he drank:</span> if someone is with him, he should wake him and tell him 'I am thirsty';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he is alone, he should make it sound like someone else is there, and recite a charm to cause the Shed to leave him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>STORES THAT PAY TAX TO IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There was an idolatrous festival in Beis Shan. Some stores were crowned with adornments of the idolatry (they pay taxes to the idolatry), and some were not. Chachamim ruled that one may buy only from uncrowned stores.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Reish Lakish):</span> It is forbidden to buy only from stores crowned with roses and myrtle, for one who enters the store benefits from the scent of ornaments of idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they are crowned with fruits, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Lo Yidbak b'Yadcha Me'umah Min ha'Cherem" forbids benefit <i>from</i> idolatry. One may give benefit <i>to</i> it.</p>
