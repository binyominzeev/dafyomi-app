<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MEDICAL ADVICE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A cut from a thorn should be put in hot water. Cold water helps for wrinkles on the face. Vice-versa is dangerous;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Vinegar is good for bloodletting, and small fish are good for a fast. Vice-versa is dangerous;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>It is dangerous to let blood after eating cress, or after a fever, or after an eye ache;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>It is good to eat fish the day before bloodletting, and also the day after. To eat fish on the third day is dangerous.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who lets blood should not eat milk, cheese, onions or cress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If he ate one of these, he should mix a Revi'is of vinegar and a Revi'is of wine, and drink it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He should relieve himself east of the city, so the stench will not bother people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> On Shabbos, we may raise Unkli (tonsils that obstructs breathing; Aruch - the opening to the stomach);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To raise it, we take a handful of cumin and mint, horehound, savory, and hyssop, and drink them with wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>For blisters he should drink these with water. A woman who is chilled while giving birth should drink them with beer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Acha brei d'Rava ground them up together, took a handful and drank them. Rav Ashi ground them up together, and took between his thumb and pinky.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> None of these worked for me. I later heard to take a small new flask of water with a spoonful of honey, put it under the stars, and to drink it the next day. This worked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following six things cure: eating cabbage, beets, dry pennyroyal (mint), stomach, womb, and diaphragm. Some say, also small fish cure;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Small fish help the whole body improve and grow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">The following 10 things aggravate sickness:</span> eating ox meat, (permitted) Chelev, roasted meat, fowl, roasted eggs, cress, shaving, a hot bath, cheese, and liver;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some add nuts; some add gourds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael says, they are called 'Kishu'in' because they are Kashin (harsh) to the body like swords.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HAIRCUTS FROM A NOCHRI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> We do not get haircuts from them in any place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri is cutting one's hair, he should look in a mirror;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If a Yisrael cuts a Nochri's hair, he must not cut near the Bluris (hair left for idolatrous rites).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that if a Nochri is cutting one's hair, he should look in a mirror. What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is in a Reshus ha'Rabim, why does he need a mirror? (Many see him!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he is in a Reshus ha'Yachid, even with a mirror it is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he is in a Reshus ha'Yachid. He looks in a mirror to make the Nochri think that he is important, so the Nochri is afraid to kill him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A Nochri was cutting the hair of Rav Chana bar Bizna in the outskirts of Neharde'a.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The Nochri:</span> Your neck is proper to be cut!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chana bar Bizna:</span> I deserve it, for transgressing R. Meir's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He also transgressed Chachamim's opinion. They permit only in a Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chana thought that since many people pass by, it is like a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael cuts a Nochri's hair, he must not cut near the Bluris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much must he distance from it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Malkiyah):</span> He must distance three fingers in every direction.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Chanina brei d'Rav Ika):</span> Rav Malkiyo taught the teachings about spit, slaves, and hair follicles;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Malkiyah taught the teachings about Bluris, ashes, and cheese.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Papa):</span> The teachings that explain Mishnayos and Beraisos are of Rav Malkiyah; the teachings that have no source in the Tana'im are of Rav Malkiyo.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>The versions argue regarding slaves (Rav Papa attributes it to Rav Malkiyah. Rashi - they also argue about ashes; Rav Papa attributes it to Rav Malkiyo).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FORBIDDEN FOODS OF NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not benefit from the following things of Nochrim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Their wine, vinegar that came from their wine, Hadriani earthenware (all these will be explained later), and hides with a hole from which the heart was removed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel forbids if the hole is round, and permits if it is long and narrow;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says, meat being taken to (where they are serving) idolatry is permitted. What is taken from it is forbidden, for it is like something sacrificed to idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One may not do business with people heading to serve idolatry. One may do business with people returning from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Meir says, if wine of a Yisrael was put in a pouch or bottle of a Nochri, one may not benefit from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Chachamim say, one may not drink it, but one may benefit from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Meir says, one may not benefit from grape skins and pits of a Nochri;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Chachamim forbid while they are still wet (i.e. for 12 months). After this, they permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Meir says, one may not benefit from fish oil and cheese of Nochrim of Beis Unaiki;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Chachamim forbid eating them, but permit benefit from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yishmael):</span> Why is cheese of Nochrim forbidden (according to Chachamim)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehoshua):</span> It is because they use (hardened milk inside) stomachs of Neveilos to curdle it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yishmael):</span> The Isur of an Olah is more severe, and some permitted a Kohen to suck what is inside the stomach of an Olah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The consensus was, it is forbidden, but there is no Me'ilah, i.e. the Isur is only mid'Rabanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehoshua):</span> Rather, it is because they use stomachs of calves used for idolatry to curdle it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yishmael):</span> If so, it should be forbidden to benefit from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>R. Yehoshua diverted the discussion. Do you read the verse "Ki Tovim <i>Dodecha</i> mi'Yayin" (masculine, Yisrael discusses how dear Hash-m is to them), or "Dodayich" (feminine, Hash-m discusses how dear Yisrael is to Him)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> It is "Dodayich."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> No, it is "Dodecha." We learn from "l'Rei'ach Shemanecha Tovim."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE ISUR OF WINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that one may not benefit from wine that was offered to idolatry?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar Avuha):</span> We learn from "Chelev Zevacheimo... Yein Nesichum";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like one may not benefit from Korbanos to idolatry, also from wine that was offered to idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one may not benefit from Korbanos to idolatry?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "... Va'Yochelu Zivchei Mesim" - just like one may not benefit from a corpse, also from Korbanos to idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one may not benefit from a corpse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Sham-Sham" from the beheaded calf:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "va'Tamas Sham Miryam", and regarding the beheaded calf it says "v'Arfu Sham" - just like one may not benefit from the beheaded calf, also from a corpse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one may not benefit from the beheaded calf?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> The beheaded calf is called 'Kaparah', just like Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Vinegar that came from their wine (is forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! It was forbidden to benefit from the wine. Souring will not permit it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> This Mishnah teaches (by inference) that one may entrust vinegar with a Nochri with a single seal (even according to the opinion that requires a double seal for wine).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are not concerned lest he be Menasech vinegar (pour it to idolatry. The Mishnah forbids vinegar that came from their wine. This implies that vinegar they bought from a Yisrael is permitted);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We are not concerned lest he switch a Yisrael's vinegar with his own (inferior) vinegar. He would not bother to forge (duplicate) the seal for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila'i):</span> If a Nochri cooked his own wine, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! It was forbidden to benefit from the wine, cooking will not permit it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> R. Ila'i teaches that one may entrust cooked wine with a Nochri with a single seal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are not concerned lest he be Menasech cooked wine. (The Mishnah forbids his own cooked wine. This implies that cooked wine he got from a Yisrael is permitted);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We are not concerned lest he switch it with his own cooked wine. He would not bother to forge the seal.</p>
