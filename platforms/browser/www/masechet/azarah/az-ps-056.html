<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE FIRST STAGE THAT IS CONSIDERED WINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It is not considered wine until it descends to the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> Wine is Tevel (forbidden to drink until Terumah is taken) after Kipuy (the grape skins float to the top and are removed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Our Mishnah is like Chachamim. The Mishnah about Tevel is like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> Wine is Tevel after it descends to the pit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, it is Tevel after Kipuy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Akiva refer to Kipuy in the pit, or in the barrel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #2):</span> Wine is Tevel after Kipuy. Even after Kipuy, one may drink from the upper Gas or pipe without tithing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, this discusses Kipuy in the pit. (If it were from the barrel, this would not affect the Gas!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Zevid's Beraisa):</span> It is considered wine after it descends to the pit and Kipuy is done;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva says, it is after he scoops it into barrels (and does Kipuy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is the meaning of Beraisa #1!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Chachamim say,) wine is Tevel after it descends to the pit (and Kipuy);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, it is Tevel after Kipuy (and it was scooped into barrels).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah said that it is not wine until it descends to the pit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is there a three-way argument among the Tana'im?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No. Our Mishnah discusses Yayin Nesech. We are stringent to consider it wine before it really is.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> According to Rava (who answered that our Mishnah is like Chachamim, and the Mishnah of Tevel is R. Akiva), we are not more stringent about Yayin Nesech. We must say that there is a three-way argument among the Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> What descends to the pit is forbidden. The rest is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This is only if he did not empty out the Gargusni (a bucket with a strainer at the bottom to catch the skins and peels and allow the wine to pass through) back into the Gas. If he did, this forbids the Gas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What forbids the Gargusni itself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is Nitzok (a liquid falling through the air into another liquid, i.e. the wine in the pit).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Nitzok into Isur forbids the top liquid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2):</span> Elsewhere, R. Chiya said that we discuss an overflowing flask. Also here, we can say that the pit was overflowing, it reached up to the bottom of the Gargusni.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES A 'NOCHRI' MAKE 'YAYIN NESECH' WHILE STOMPING?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one stomp grapes with a Nochri?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (A learned six-year old):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Nochri will be Menasech the wine! (This forbids benefit from it, so one may not take wages for stomping!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the Nochri's hands are tied.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Nochri will be Menasech with his foot!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is not the normal way to be Menasech. It does not forbid benefit from the wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A case occurred in Neharde'a, in which a Nochri and a Yisrael stomped grapes together. Shmuel withheld ruling for three festivals.</p>
