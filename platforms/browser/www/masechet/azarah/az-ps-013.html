<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One may not buy even from stores crowned with fruits;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Benefit from idolatry is forbidden, and all the more so giving benefit to it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish - Beraisa #1 - R. Noson):</span> On the day that the idolatry pardons taxes, they announce 'anyone who honors the idolatry by putting crowns on his head and his donkey's head, he is exempt. Others are liable.' What should a Yisrael do?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he dons a crown, he benefits from (the smell of) the idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he does not don a crown, he benefits the idolatry (he pays tax to it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Therefore, one who buys or sells in the fair of idolatry may not benefit from what he got;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he bought an animal, we cut its legs below the knee. Peros, clothing or Kelim are left to rot. We throw metal Kelim or (if he sold and received) money in the Dead Sea.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The Beraisa forbids benefiting the idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mesharshiya brei d'Rav Idi):</span> Reish Lakish holds that Chachamim argue with R. Noson, and he rules like Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan holds that all agree with R. Noson.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa argues with R. Noson (and R. Yochanan knew the Beraisa)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> One may go to a bazaar of Nochrim, and buy animals, slaves, houses, fields and vineyards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He may go to their courts (to get deeds of ownership), lest he lose the property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Kohen may go to Chutz la'Aretz, even though this makes him Tamei mid'Rabanan, to plead his case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Similarly, he may become Tamei there (passing through) a cemetery for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is Tum'ah mid'Oraisa. Surely it is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he may become Tamei through a Beis ha'Pras (a field in which a corpse was plowed). Its Tum'ah is mid'Rabanan (perhaps the plow dragged bones and he will step on one).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>He may become Tamei (mid'Rabanan) to learn Torah or marry a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>R. Yehudah says, if he can find a Rebbi here, he may not become Tamei to learn elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>R. Yosi permits this, for perhaps he will learn better from the Rebbi there;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Yosef ha'Kohen followed his Rebbi to Tzidon (in Chutz la'Aretz) to learn.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa agrees with R. Noson. One may not buy from a merchant, for the idolatry collects taxes from them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa permits buying from a regular person, from whom they do not collect taxes.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT TO DO TO FORBIDDEN ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beraisa #1 says that if one bought an animal, we cut its legs. One may not cause (unnecessary) pain to animals!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> "Es Suseihem Te'aker" (teaches that this is proper).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If he bought an animal, we cut its legs below the knee.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #3):</span> (After the Churban) one should not make things Hekdesh or vow Erchin (an amount of money based on a person's age and gender) to Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one was Makdish, we ensure that no one will benefit from it as follows. We are Me'aker an animal. We leavePeros, garments or Kelim (in a place where no one will take them) to rot. We throw metal Kelim or money into the Dead Sea;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'Ikur' means locking it up so it will starve to death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We do not cut the legs of Hekdesh, for that would be disgraceful (the animal would survive a long time with cut legs).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should slaughter it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps someone would come to eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should cut it into two halves!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> "You will break their altars... Lo Sa'asun Ken la'Shem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We do not cut its legs, for that would <i>look like</i> blemishing Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is truly blemishing Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When the Mikdash stands, the animal is destined to be offered, it is blemishing Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nowadays that the animal cannot be offered, it is permitted (mid'Oraisa, and forbidden mid'Rabanan because it looks like blemishing Hekdesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should be forbidden mid'Oraisa, just like putting another blemish in a blemished Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though the Korban cannot be offered, one may not blemish it further!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A blemished Korban cannot be offered, but it is redeemed and we offer a replacement with the redemption money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nowadays, we cannot offer the animal or its value (so mid'Oraisa one may blemish it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yonah):</span> What is the law regarding slaves? (Are we Oker them?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, we do not harm Yisrael slaves. The question is about Nochri slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ila'i - Beraisa):</span> We do not cause Nochrim or shepherds of small animals (who constantly steal by grazing their animals in others' fields) to die, nor do we save them. (I.e. we are not Oker Nochri slaves.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT MAY WE BUY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The Beraisa permits buying slaves. Is this only Yisraelim, or even Nochrim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> Presumably, it is only Yisraelim. Why should we be lenient to allow buying Nochrim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravin):</span> We may buy even a Nochri. He will become an 'Eved Kena'ani', who keeps the Mitzvos incumbent on women!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> That does not explain why one may buy animals!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> Rather, one may buy animals for this is detrimental to the Nochri. This also justifies buying a Nochri slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yakov bought a sandal (at a Nochri bazaar). R. Yirmeyah bought bread. Each rebuked the other 'Your Rebbi would not do so'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Each bought from a regular person, but thought that the other bought from a merchant.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba brei d'R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> One may not buy from a merchant, for the idolatry collects taxes from them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One may buy from a regular person, for they do not collect taxes from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> Had R. Yochanan seen that here, the idolatry collects taxes from regular people, he would have forbidden that also!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did R. Yakov and R. Yirmeyah buy?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The idolatry collects from regular people who always sell. They bought from regular people who do not normally sell.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ITEMS UNIQUELY USED FOR IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not sell the following to Nochrim (they will be explained in the Gemara): Itzterobelin, Benos Shu'ach, Petoteros, frankincense, and white chickens;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah permits selling a white chicken among many chickens;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one sells only a white chicken, he must cut off its leg;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Nochrim do not offer to idolatry animals or birds missing a limb.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>All other things are permitted if Stam, but forbidden if specified (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir forbids selling a good Dekel (date tree), Chatzav, and Niklas to a Nochri.</p>
