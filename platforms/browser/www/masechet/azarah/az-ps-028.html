<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MORTAL DANGER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> A Nochri may not heal any wound for which we may desecrate Shabbos (because there is mortal danger).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> A Nochri may not heal any internal wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the two versions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about a wound on the back of the hand or foot.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Masnah):</span> A wound on the back of the hand or foot is <i>like</i> an internal wound. One may desecrate Shabbos for it (nevertheless, it is not internal. Rabah bar bar Chanah permits a Nochri to cure it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> We may desecrate Shabbos for any wound for which we must estimate (whether or not the person will live).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shemen bar Aba):</span> A hot fever is like an internal wound. One may desecrate Shabbos for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered an internal wound?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> It is from the lips and inside.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WOUNDS OF THE MOUTH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> What is the law of a wound on the Kachi (Rashi - gums; Tosfos - wide teeth) or (Tosfos - other) teeth?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since they are hard, this is like an external wound;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since they are internal, perhaps it is considered an internal wound!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If one's teeth hurt, he may not Yigma (Abaye explains, put in his mouth and spit out; Rava - swallow) vinegar (on Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he is in great pain, this is permitted (because it is considered an internal wound)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Tana taught 'hurt', and this includes a great pain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Yochanan contracted Tzafdina (a tooth disease). He went to a Nochris to cure it, on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> What should I do tomorrow? (I must teach on Shabbos. I cannot come!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The Nochris:</span> You need not do anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> What if it hurts, and I must cure it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Nochris would not tell him until he swore not to reveal it. He said 'I swear to the G-d of Yisrael, I will not reveal it.' She told him, and he taught it to the Talmidim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He swore not to reveal it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He swore not to reveal it <i>to</i> the G-d of Yisrael. He never swore not to reveal it to Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (She did not realize this.) This was Chilul Hash-m!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Right) after she told him, he explained his oath to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Since R. Yochanan would use the cure on Shabbos, it must be that it is considered an internal wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Tzafdina is an exception. It begins in the mouth but spreads to the intestines.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are its symptoms?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one puts something on the Kachi, the teeth bleed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It comes from eating cold wheat products, hot barley products, or leftover Kisa d'Harsena (fish fried in its own oil with flour).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What cure did she give?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha brei d.Rava):</span> It was water of sourdough, olive oil, and salt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> She melted fat of a goose, and applied it to his teeth with a wing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> None of these worked for me. An Arab told me to roast pits of unripe olives on a glowing hot shovel and apply it to my teeth, and this worked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could R. Yochanan allow a Nochris to heal him? He himself said that any wound for which we may desecrate Shabbos, a Nochri may not heal it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> An important person may be healed by them. (They are afraid to harm him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Avahu was important, and Yakov Minah applied a potion to his thigh that would have cut it off, had R. Ami and Rav Asi not removed it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Nochris who healed R. Yochanan was a professional. (She would not harm him and ruin her reputation.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also Yakov Minah was a professional, and he sought to harm R. Avahu!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> The Minim had an exceptional hatred of R. Avahu. They were willing to suffer themselves just to harm him (like Shimshon did to the Plishtim) - "Tamos Nafshi Im Plishtim."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER CURES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A wound from a sword is dangerous. We desecrate Shabbos for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To stop the bleeding, he should drink (some say - apply to the wound) cress in vinegar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>To help a scab form, he makes a bandage of a herb and wood of a bush, or worms (R. Chananel - excrement).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Safra):</span> Large blisters are a precursor to death;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To cure them, he eats grated rue with honey, or celery with wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Until this is ready, he should press on the blisters grapes of the same color (white or black).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Boils come due to a fever;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To cure them, he should snap his finger against them 60 times, and cut them lengthwise and widthwise.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is needed only if the top of the boil is not white;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is white, one must merely take out the pus.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yakov had a pain in his rectum. R. Ami told him to wrap seven red aloe seeds in a certain cloth, tie it with a certain string, dip it in white stacte (a spice), burn it, and scatter the ashes on the top of the rectum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Until this is ready, he should place pits of shrub-nuts on the rectum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For the bottom, he should apply melted Chelev of a goat that has not given birth. If not, he should take three dried gourd leaves, and spread them on it. If not, he uses shells of snails, and if not oil blended into wax, and he should cover himself with linen clothing if it is summer, or (warm) cotton clothing if it is winter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Avahu's ear hurt him; he was told to take the kidney of a goat, tear it lengthwise and widthwise, put it on glowing coals, and put the liquid that exudes (when it is lukewarm) in the ear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, he should apply melted Chelev of a fat beetle. If not, he should fill the ear with oil, make seven wicks of fodder, and (one by one) put one end in a fire, the other end in the ear, and beware of drafts. (Some say, the wicks are rubbed with oil of fodder.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If not, he should take unbeaten tufts, and put them in the ear, facing a fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If not, he should take a 100 year old reed, salt it, roast it and stick it to the ear.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The liquid remedies help a dry ear. The dry remedies help a wet ear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Zutra):</span> We may raise drooping ears on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> Only the hand may be used, but not a potion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> Only a potion may be used, and not the hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because by hand, one makes a wound.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>AFFLICTIONS OF THE EYE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If an eye is about to leave the socket, one may apply a potion to it on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rabanan assumed that one may not do Melachah for this, e.g. to grind ingredients for it or carry though a Reshus ha'Rabim. Rather, it must be ready from before Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov citing Rav Yehudah):</span> One <i>may</i> do Melachah for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may apply a potion to an eye on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> If one would do like Rav Yehudah said, he desecrates Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah's eye was hurting; he asked if he may apply a potion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> It is permitted for everyone except you (for you did not accept it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I did not say the Halachah on my own. I received it from Shmuel (in addition to being the greatest Chacham in Bavel after Rav, Shmuel was a brilliant doctor)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A slave in Shmuel's house was screaming because she felt burning in her eye on Shabbos. No one helped her. Her eye fell out. The next day, Shmuel taught that one may apply a potion to an eye about to leave the socket on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Nerves connect the eye to the heart (Rambam - so this is mortal danger, and full desecration of Shabbos is permitted. Tosfos - sight and understanding of the heart depend on each other, therefore we are lenient to allow this, but not mid'Oraisa desecration of Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For what eye afflictions may one desecrate Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is permitted if eye gum drips from it, there is a stabbing pain, inflammation and the beginning of sickness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He excludes the end of sickness, or to improve vision.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Going to a bathhouse is dangerous for one who was stung by a wasp, cut by a thorn, has a boil, his eye hurts, or he has a fever;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Radishes are good for sunstroke, and beets are good for chills. Vice-versa is dangerous;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>A scorpion bite should be put in hot water, and a wasp bite should be put in cold water. Vice-versa is dangerous;</p>
