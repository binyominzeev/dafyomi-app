<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ITEMS UNIQUELY USED FOR IDOLATRY (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What are Itzterobelin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They are Turnisa (Rashi - cedar trees; Tosfos - ivy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa):</span> (At first, people did not apply the laws of Shemitah to the following species. Later.) Chachamim taught that Shemitah applies also to Alchsin ((pistacio?) nuts), Itzterobelin, Muchsasin (a type of figs) (and - Tosfos deletes this) Benos Shu'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shemitah does not apply to Turnisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Shemitah applies to what has roots (Rashi - that endure the winter; Tosfos - in the ground), but not to anything else.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Safra):</span> Rather, they are galllnuts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Benos Shu'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> These are (a species of) white figs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> And Petoteros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This (is not a species by itself. Rather, this) teaches that Itzterobelin and Benos Shu'ach are forbidden only when the stems are attached.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Frankincense.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> This refers to clear frankincense (a specific kind of frankincense).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Regarding all of these, one may sell a whole bundle.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered a bundle?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> A bundle is at least three Manos (in weight).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest the Nochri sell to others, and they will offer it to idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We are commanded "Lifnei Iver..." (do not cause someone to sin), but not (Rosh - regarding Nochrim) 'Lifnei Lifnei' (do not cause someone to cause someone else to sin).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN DO WE SUSPECT THAT ONE BUYS FOR IDOLATRY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> White chickens.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yonah):</span> If a Nochri is crying out 'who has a chicken (to sell)', one may sell him a white chicken;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he asks 'who has a white chicken', it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah permits selling a white chicken among many chickens.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the Nochri was asking 'who has a white chicken', it should be forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he was asking 'who has a chicken', and R. Yehudah permits selling only a white chicken among other chickens;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This implies that the first Tana forbids even selling a white chicken among other chickens!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> No, he was asking for a white chicken <i>and</i> chickens of other colors (Rashi; Tosfos - he pointed at the chickens he wanted, and one was white).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> It is forbidden to sell a white chicken if the Nochri specifically requested it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he wanted two chickens, and one of them was white, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even if wanted only a white chicken, if he was making a banquet for his son or if someone in his family was sick, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If he was making a feast in honor of his son's wedding, only that day and that Nochri are forbidden. (On that day, even things that are not special for idolatry are forbidden to sell to him!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Rav Mesharshiya):</span> The Beraisa discusses a mere party, but not a wedding feast.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All other things are permitted if Stam, but forbidden if specified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Stam and 'specified' mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Stam is when he asks for white wheat. 'Specified' is when he says 'for idolatry.'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> In both cases, the law is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Stam is when he asks for wheat, and specified is when he asks for white wheat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Regarding chickens, even Stam (he asked for chickens), one may not give white chickens!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and defense of Answer #1):</span> Really, Stam is when he asks for white wheat, and specified is when he says 'for idolatry.' The Chidush is when he specifies;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that he really doesn't need it for idolatry (since normally it is not offered). The man is an avid idolater. He himself gives a discount to anyone buying for idolatry, and he assumes that everyone does the same. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> If he asks for a white chicken missing a limb, may we sell him a complete white chicken?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he asked for a defective chicken, he does not intend for idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he is scheming to make us think that he does not want it for idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If you will say that he is scheming, if he asked for a white chicken, but bought black and red chickens (may we then sell a white chicken)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since we see that he does not want them for idolatry, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he is scheming to make us think this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER FORBIDDEN ITEMS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Meir forbids selling a good Dekel, Chatzav, and Niklas to a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Avraham Avinu learned 400 Perakim in tractate Avodah Zarah. We only have five, and we do not understand all of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Avimi:</span> What don't you understand?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> R. Meir forbids selling a good Dekel. This implies that we may sell bad date trees;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> We may not sell to them anything attached to the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Avimi):</span> 'Good Dekel' refers to the fruits of a good date tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> 'Good Dekel' refers to the fruits of a good date tree. 'Chatzav' is a species of dates (Rashi; Aruch - sugar cane).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> 'Niklas' is Koraiti.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> This does not help me. I didn't know what is Niklas, nor what is Koraiti!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> When you get to Eretz Yisrael, people can show you Koraiti (but they would not know what is Niklas).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SELLING ANIMALS TO NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In a place where the custom is to sell small animals (i.e. that do not work, such as goats and sheep) to Nochrim, we may sell; in a place where the custom is not to sell, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In all places one may not sell large animals, calves and foals, healthy or lame;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah permits selling a lame animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Ben Beseira permits selling a horse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Inference: Selling small animals depends on the local custom. It is not intrinsically forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> One may not leave an animal with a Nochri innkeeper, for they are suspected of bestiality.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> In a place where (Nochrim are not suspected, so) selling is permitted, one may also leave animals with them. In a place where (Nochrim are suspected, so) selling is forbidden, it is also forbidden to leave animals with them.</p>
