<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE EXECUTION OF R. CHANINA BEN TERADYON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>It was decreed that he be burned, for he was Hogeh the letters of Hash-m's name (Rashi - he expounded them; Tosfos - he pronounced His name as it is written).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could he do so?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following have no share in the world to come: one who denies that Hash-m gave the Torah, one who denies that the Torah alludes to the world to come;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Aba Sha'ul says, also one who is Hogeh Hash-m's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Aba Sha'ul discusses one who does so to achieve his desires.) Rav Chanina did so for the sake of learning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> You may not learn (witchcraft) to practice it, but you may learn it to understand (the laws of it) and to give rulings about it. (The same applies to being Hogeh His name.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why was he punished?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did so in public.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>It was decreed that his wife be killed, because she did not protest to what he did.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that if one could protest, but does not, he is punished.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>It was decreed that his daughter would be placed in a harlots' booth, for she once acted immodestly:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She once walked in front of important people of Romi, and heard them praise the way she stepped. She made an effort to take nice steps.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Avon Akevai Yesubeni" - transgressions that one does with his feet (some say - tramples, i.e. ignores) in this world surround him on the day of judgment (in the world to come).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>When they were taken out for their punishments, they justified Hash-m's decree:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> "Ha'Tzur Tamim Pa'alo..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">His wife:</span> "Kel Emunah v'Ein Avel."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">His daughter:</span> "Gedol ha'Etzah v'Rav ha'Aliliyah... Al Kol Darchei Bnei Adam."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> They were such great Tzadikim that there was a verse to justify the judgment of each one!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When R. Yosi ben Kisma fell sick, R. Chanina ben Tradyon (his Talmid) visited him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> Hash-m put Romi in power, allowed them to destroy the Mikdash and kill the greatest Tzadikim, and they are still ruling;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>I hear that you teach Torah to multitudes, holding a Sefer Torah! (You endanger yourself!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> Hash-m will have mercy on me (to protect me).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> That is not a proper answer! I suspect that you will be burned with the Sefer Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> What kind of share will I have in the world to come?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> Is there an episode that characterizes you?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> I once collected money for Purim, and I mistakenly thought it was (Stam) Tzedakah, and gave it for Tzedakah. Later, I donated that amount for Purim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> I hope that I will have a share like you!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Soon after this, R. Yosi ben Kisma died. The Roman officials went to bury him, and eulogized him greatly. On their return, they saw R. Chanina ben Tradyon teaching Torah to multitudes, holding a Sefer Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>They wrapped him in the Sefer Torah and surrounded him with bundles of vines, which they lit on fire. They put wet sponges over his heart, so he would not die quickly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">His daughter:</span> Woe that I see you this way!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> If I was burned alone, I would feel bad. Since they burn me with the Sefer Torah, Hash-m will avenge the burning of the Torah, and also the burning of me.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> What do you see?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> The margins of the parchment are burning, and the letters are flying in the air.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> Open your mouth, so the fire will enter and you will die quickly!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> Hash-m gave me my soul. He will take it, and not I.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">The executioner:</span> Rebbi, if I increase the fire and remove the sponges, will you bring me to the world to come?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>R. Chanina agreed, and swore to him about this. The executioner did as he said; R. Chanina died quickly, and the executioner jumped into the fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">A voice from Heaven:</span> R. Chanina and the executioner are prepared for the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi cried:</span> Some acquire their share in the world to come in a moment, and some acquire their share over the course of many years!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SAVING HIS DAUGHTER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Bruriya, R. Meir's wife, was the daughter of R. Chanina. She was distraught that her sister was in a harlot's booth. R. Meir was confident that if she was still a Tzadekes, Hash-m would miraculously enable him to redeem her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He took a great amount of money and dressed up like a (Roman) soldier. He went to her booth, and requested her services.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina's daughter:</span> I cannot. I am menstruating!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> I will wait for you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina's daughter:</span> There are many girls here prettier than me!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Meir understood that she would say this to everyone, and she never sinned. He asked her guardian to release her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The guardian:</span> I fear the kingdom!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> Take this money. Half you can use to bribe your overseer when he threatens you (Rashi; Tosfos - you will give it in place of the tax they collect for each harlot), and the other half you can enjoy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The guardian:</span> What will I do when the money runs out?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> Say 'G-d of Meir, answer me!' and you will be saved.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">The guardian:</span> Who says that I will be answered?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Meir demonstrated. He threw earth at vicious dogs, inciting them to eat him. He said 'G-d of Meir, answer me'; the dogs left him alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The guardian released her. The king found out; they hung him on a gallows. He said 'G-d of Meir, answer me'; he came down.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The executioners:</span> What is going on?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The guardian explained. They carved R. Meir's image on the gates of Romi, and announced that whoever sees him should seize him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One day, he was seen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> He fled to a house of harlotry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> He found food of Nochrim; he dipped fingers in it, and sucked (different) fingers (it seemed he eats it with appetite).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #3:</span> Eliyahu assumed the form of a harlot, and was embracing him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">His pursuers:</span> That cannot be R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Due to this, R. Meir fled to Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> R. Meir fled to Bavel out of shame over his wife (who succumbed to temptation and killed herself out of shame).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MOSHAV LETZIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> The following are forbidden due to frivolity: going to stadiums (e.g. bullfighting) or a siege around a city where they engage in witchcraft, snake-charming, or other frivolity;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ashrei... Lo Halach... Ki Im b'Toras Hash-m" - going to frivolity causes one to be idle from Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> One may go to stadiums, for (if a Yisrael is thrown to the bull) one can scream to save him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may go to a siege around a city, for if they conquer the city, he may be able to save Yisraelim inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may not encourage them to besiege the city (Rashi; Tosfos - one may not be counted among the soldiers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Resolution - part 1 (regarding a siege):</span> Beraisa #1 forbids it when the Yisrael encourages (Tosfos - is counted with) them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Resolution - part 2 (regarding a stadium):</span> Tana'im argue about this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not go to a stadium, for it is frivolity;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Noson permits it for two reasons. Perhaps he can scream to save a Yisrael. Or, at least he will be able to testify that he died, to permit the widow to remarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One may not go to theatres and stadiums because they are Mezavel (Rashi - oversee the needs of; Tosfos - sacrifice to) idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Chachamim say, where they are Mezavel, it is forbidden lest people think that he is Mezavel. Where they are not Mezavel, it is forbidden due to frivolity.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina mi'Sura):</span> They argue about one who bought or sold there. (R. Meir is concerned for money of idolatry, so he forbids b'Di'eved. Chachamim permit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Pazi) Question:</span> "Ashrei... Lo Halach... Lo Amad uv'Moshav Letzim Lo Yashav" - since he did not go, surely he did not stand; since he did not stand, surely he did not sit, surely he did not scoff!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> The verse teaches that had he gone, in the end he would stand. Had he stood, in the end he would sit. Had he sat, in the end he would scoff.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding frivolity, it says "v'Latzta Levadecha Tisa" (you will bear the punishment yourself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Anyone who scoffs is afflicted - "Al Tislotzatzu Pen Yechzeku Mosereichem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rava (to Rabanan):</span> Please don't scoff, lest you bring afflictions on yourselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ketina):</span> Anyone who scoffs, his income will be reduced - "(Hash-m) Mashach Yado Es Lotzetzim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Anyone who scoffs falls to Gehinom - "Letz... b'Evras Zadon";</p>
