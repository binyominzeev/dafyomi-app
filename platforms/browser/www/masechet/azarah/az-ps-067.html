<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Indeed, Rava cannot hold like R. Meir, but even R. Yehudah could hold like Abaye!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> All forbid warm bread that was put on top of an open barrel (it absorbs a strong smell);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All permit cold bread that was put on top of a closed barrel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They argue about warm bread on a closed barrel and cold bread on an open barrel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Smelling through Bas Tiha is like warm bread on an open barrel!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>'NOSEN TA'AM LI'FGAM'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The general rule is, if it gives a beneficial taste...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah is like our Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah and Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> We permit only when the vinegar fell on hot grits;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it fell on cold grits and then they were heated, this is like something that initially was li'Shvach (improves the taste) and later was Pogem (spoils the taste). It is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> People used to put vinegar on cold grits on Erev Shabbos in Tzipori. They called it Shichlayim (cress), for vinegar is also added to Shichlayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> We do not permit due to Nosen Ta'am li'Fgam if the mixture tastes bad due to too much or too little salt or spices;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, Nosen Ta'am li'Fgam permits if it is properly seasoned, and the Isur detracts from the taste.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> Do not say that if a mixture had more or less seasoning it would taste good, therefore we do not permit due to Nosen Ta'am li'Fgam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, if (as it is seasoned) now the Isur detracts from the taste, it is permitted. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> If the Isur gives taste and is intact, if it has k'Zayis (of Isur) bi'Chdei Achilas Pras (in the volume of a half loaf, i.e. three or four eggs), it is forbidden. One is lashed for eating (a k'Zayis of Isur in) the mixture;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">67b----------------------------------------67b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Isur gives taste and is not intact (Rashi - it was dissolved; R. Eliyahu - it is less than k'Zayis bi'Chdei Achilas Pras; R. Yosef - even if it has k'Zayis bi'Chdei Achilas Pras), it is forbidden, but one is not lashed for eating it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it makes the taste even worse, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not say that if it harms the taste, it is permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that even if other (permitted) things also harm the taste, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Halachah follows Version #2 of Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> We learn from all these Amora'im that Nosen Ta'am li'Fgam is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Granted, we learn from the others, but how do we learn from Reish Lakish?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He explains the Mishnah. Perhaps he holds that the Halachah does not follow our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that a Tana forbids Nosen Ta'am li'Fgam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Whether an Isur is li'Shvach or li'Fgam, it forbids (a mixture);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, li'Shvach forbids, but li'Fgam does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Meir learns from Isur absorbed in Kelim of Nochrim. Even though it is li'Fgam, the Torah forbids it (i.e. Yisrael needed to Kasher the Kelim they took from Midyan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Shimon explains like Rav Huna brei d'Rav Chiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Chiya):</span> The Torah forbids only a Keli that absorbed Isur the same day (most explain - within the last 24 hours. After this, the taste is Pagum.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir says, even if the Isur was absorbed the same day, it is somewhat Pagum (therefore, we do not distinguish. It is forbidden in any case.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Lo Sochlu Chol Nevelah la'Ger (... Titnenah va'Achalah)" - it is called (and forbidden like) Neveilah only if a Ger (Toshav) would eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir does not learn from here. He says that this excludes only a Neveilah that was spoiled from the beginning (before the animal died).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon does not need a verse to exclude that case. It is like earth.</p>
