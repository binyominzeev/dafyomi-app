<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi ha'Galili says, "Eloheihem Al he'Harim" - their gods on the mountains, but the mountains are not (Ri - considered; R. Tam - forbidden like) their gods.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is because man had a part in (planting) it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anything that man had a part in becomes forbidden (if it is Ne'evad).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Akiva says, (do not expound similarly, "v'Sachas Kol Etz Ra'anan" to forbid <i>under</i> every fresh tree, but the trees are not their gods.

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> R. Yosi ha'Galili agrees with Chachamim (the first Tana)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> They argue about the covering of a mountain;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim do not consider it like a mountain, so it can become forbidden. R. Yosi ha'Galili considers it like a mountain, so it is permitted.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about a tree (Rashi - a seed; Tosfos - a sapling) that was planted and later Ne'evad. Chachamim permit it, and R. Yosi ha'Galili forbids it.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> Why is an Asherah forbidden? It is because man had a part in it. <i>Anything</i> that man had a part in becomes forbidden.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This includes a tree that was planted and later Ne'evad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Also R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah forbids a tree that was planted and later Ne'evad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> It says "Eloheihem Al he'Harim" - their gods on the mountains, but the mountains are not their gods;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One might have thought to expound similarly "v'Sachas Kol Etz Ra'anan" - under every fresh tree, but the trees are not their gods. "Va'Ashereihem Tisrefun ba'Esh" teaches that this is not so.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches like R. Akiva taught;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his source for a tree that was planted and later Ne'evad?</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (This connotes that what will grow from the stump is forbidden.) When is the stump of an Asherah permitted, but the rest is forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A tree was planted, and later it was Ne'evad (what grew afterwards is forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said that he learned from "va'Ashereihem Tisrefun ba'Esh"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, if not for "va'Ashereihem Tisrefun ba'Esh", one would have thought that "Va'Ashereihem Tigade'un" discusses a tree that was planted in order to worship it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Now that "va'Ashereihem Tisrefun ba'Esh" forbids such trees, "va'Ashereihem Tigade'un" forbids a tree that was planted and later Ne'evad.</p>
