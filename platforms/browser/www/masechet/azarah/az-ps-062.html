<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri hired a Yisrael to work with Yayin Nesech, the wages are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he hired him for different work, even if he asked him to transport a barrel of Yayin Nesech, the wages are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a Nochri rented a Yisrael's donkey to carry Yayin Nesech, the wages are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he rented it to ride on, even if he puts his wine pouch on it, the rental is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why are the wages forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Since one may not benefit from Yayin Nesech, also the wages are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One may not benefit from Orlah and Kilai ha'Kerem, yet we do not forbid all benefit from them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sold Isurei ha'Na'ah (e.g. Orlah or Kilai ha'Kerem) and was Mekadesh a woman with the money, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Since Yayin Nesech transfers its Isur to whatever it is exchanged for, also the wages are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shemitah transfers its Isur, yet its wages are permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told a worker (Shimon) 'here is a Dinar. Gather its value of Shemitah Peros for me', (it is as if Shimon gathers fruit and sells it, so) the money is forbidden (after the time for Bi'ur, like Peros Shemitah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he told him 'here is a Dinar. Gather Shemitah Peros for me', it is permitted. (Shimon merely works for Reuven.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Avahu):</span> Chachamim made fines to forbid wages of donkey-drivers and Yayin Nesech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the fine about donkey-drivers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If donkey-drivers were working with Shemitah Peros, their wages are Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'their wages are Shemitah'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The employer pays them with Shemitah Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One may not pay a debt with Shemitah Peros. They are "Le'achlah", and not for business!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, their wages have Kedushah of Shemitah. (One must buy food with them, and the food gets Kedushas Shemitah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told a worker 'here is a Dinar. Gather its value of Shemitah Peros for me', the money is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he told him 'here is a Dinar. Gather Shemitah Peros for me', it is permitted. (The latter applies to their wages, for they did not sell Peros.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Really, he pays them with Shemitah Peros;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He gives in the permitted way (for a gift).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Levi may not tell Yehudah 'take this Ma'aser Sheni to Yerushalayim, we will divide it there' (this is like paying for his labor with Ma'aser Sheni);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">62b----------------------------------------62b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He may say 'take it to Yerushalayim. We will eat it there', and they give to each other a free gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Really, their wages have Kedushas Shemitah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A regular worker's wages (for picking Shemitah Peros) are permitted. Chachamim decreed only about wages of donkey-drivers, which are great.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We are stringent about Yayin Nesech to forbid even a regular worker's wages.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DISPOSING OF FORBIDDEN WAGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a worker was hired to work with wine of a Nochri (we do not know whether he was Menasech it), are the wages permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since we forbid benefit from Nochri wine, like Yayin Nesech, we forbid also its wages;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since it is not Tamei like Yayin Nesech, we do not forbid its wages?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Nochri rented Reuven's boat to transport wine. He paid with wheat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> You must burn the wheat and bury it in a cemetery.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't he scatter it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People will come to gather it and benefit from it. This is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't he burn it and scatter it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People will use it for fertilizer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't he bury it intact?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following are buried with one who is executed: the rock used to kill him, the wood he was hung from, the sword used to kill him, or the cloth used to choke him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Those are buried in a cemetery of Beis Din. People realize that they (were used for execution and) are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Here, if one finds the wheat in the ground, he will think that a thief buried it. He will not know that it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A DELAYED EXCHANGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Yanai's household used to borrow Shemitah Peros from poor people, and pay them back in the eighth year. People told this to R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> That is proper. A similar case regarding an Esnan (wages of a harlot) is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven gave an Esnan to a harlot and did not have relations with her, or he had relations with her and did not give to her, the Esnan is permitted (to be a Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> If he did not have relations with her, it is a mere gift. Obviously it is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> If he did not give to her anything, there is no Esnan! What does 'her Esnan is permitted' mean?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, if he gave an Esnan to a harlot and later had relations with her, or he had relations with her and later gave to her an Esnan, it is permitted.</p>
