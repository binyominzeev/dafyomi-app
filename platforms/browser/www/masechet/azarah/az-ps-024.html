<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BUYING KORBANOS FROM NOCHRIM (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding the stones of the Efod, it says "Avnei Shoham" (without a 'Vav'), therefore they (Tosfos - and the stones of the Choshen, which follows immediately in the verse) are disconnected from "Bnei Yisrael v'Yikchu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> It says "<i>v</i>'Avnei Milu'im (<i>and</i> the stones of the Choshen)", connecting them (Rashi - and also the stones of the Efod) to "Bnei Yisrael v'Yikchu"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> The next year, a red heifer was born in Dama's herd. He said 'I know that I could receive any price I ask. I request only the money I lost last year.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> They bought (the heifer, and wanted to buy the stone) through a Yisrael middleman (this is considered buying from a Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Eliezer is concerned for bestiality!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim, to R. Eliezer):</span> A red heifer was bought from a Nochri, i.e. Dama!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> The case was, Yisraelim guarded it (to ensure that he not have relations with it) from the day it was born.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer is concerned for bestiality. He also requires that it be bought from a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The case was, Yisraelim guarded it from the day it was born.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rava, we must be concerned lest he had relations with its mother from the time it is formed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If an animal gored a person or had relations with a person, if it was pregnant at the time, the fetus is also disqualified from being a Korban, for it was part of the goring or bestiality.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yisraelim guarded also the mother from the time the fetus was formed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We must be concerned lest he had relations with the mother even before this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any animal disqualified from being a Korban, its offspring is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The offspring is disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The question is not according to Rava;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> They only argue in a case that the bestiality was after they became Hekdesh. All agree that bestiality when they were Chulin does not disqualify the offspring.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The question is according to Rav Huna bar Chinena;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Chinena):</span> They only argue in a case that the bestiality occurred when they were Chulin, all agree that bestiality when they were Hekdesh disqualifies the offspring.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yisraelim guarded the mother from the time the mother was formed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest he had relations with the mother's mother!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (The child is disqualified only because it is disgraceful.) The grandmother is very distant, so we are not concerned for it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BREEDING A RED HEIFER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We answered above that Yisraelim guarded the mother from the day the fetus was formed. How did they know that it would be red?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> They pass a red cup in front of the mother during mating. This causes the child to be red.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since it is so easy to cause a heifer to be red, why is it so expensive?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is disqualified even if it has two hairs that are not red (this is normally the case).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did we try to make a Nochri's cow red, and not those of Yisraelim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> Dama's cows were established to have red calves via a cup.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BUYING KORBANOS FROM NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rav Papa - (R. Ami or R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> Similarly, R. Eliezer disqualified any Korban bought from a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(The other of them):</span> Chachamim challenged R. Eliezer from "Kol Tzon Kedar... Al Ratzon Mizbechi";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> In the future, they will convert without Beis Din (this is invalid, but in any case they will guard the Mitzvos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> He learns from "Ehfoch El Amim... Likro Kulam b'Shem Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Perhaps they will cease only idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The verse ends "Le'avdo Shechem Echad."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Zvid - (R. Ami and R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> Similarly, R. Eliezer disqualified any Korban bought from a Nochri;</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The verse ends "Le'avdo Shechem Echad."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Eliezer):</span> Animals of Miztri'im were acceptable for Korbanos - "Atah Titen b'Yadenu Zevachim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Before the Torah was given, bestiality did not disqualify Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yikach Yisro... Olos..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also this was before the Torah was given.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like the opinion that Yisro came before the Torah was given.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that he came after the Torah was given, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He bought Korbanos from Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Me'Amaleki... Meitav ha'Tzon veha'Bakar Lema'an Zevo'ach..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They spared the best animals in order to sell them and buy Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they spare only the best animals?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are easiest to sell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yomer Aravnah (the Yevusi)... ha'Bakar la'Olah veha'Morigim u'Chlei ha'Bakar la'Etzim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Aravnah was a Ger Toshav (who observes his Mitzvos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are "Morigim"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are planks with indentations. Animals step on them, and the grain is threshed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE COWS THAT RETURNED THE ARON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Es ha'Paros (with which the Plishtim sent the Aron) He'elu Olah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was an exceptional ruling, due to the miracles.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> We must say so, for normally females cannot be Olos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A female is valid for an Olah on a private altar.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> "Va'Yikach Shmuel Tele Chalav Echad va'Ya'alehu Olah (he offered a nursing ewe)" teaches that a female is a valid Olah on a private altar.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Ya'alehu" is masculine, teaching that he offered the suckling lamb!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though we pronounce it 'va'Ya'alehu', it is written 'va'Ya'aleha' (feminine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a man has relations with a female animal less than three years old, it will become sterile. (Therefore, Nochrim do not have relation with animals under three, and Chachamim permit buying them for Korbanos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is more than three years old, it will (Tosfos - probably) not become sterile, therefore one may not buy it for a Korban (Tosfos - or leave it with a Nochri).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> All the verses asked against R. Eliezer (that do not specify that the animals were less than three) may be asked against R. Yochanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answers:</span> Indeed, they refer only to animals under three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Es ha'Paros He'elu Olah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The cows were under three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Noson):</span> "V'Es Bneihem Kalu va'Bayis" - a cow does not give birth before it is three! (Tosfos - nature has changed, it happens nowadays.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one buys a cow or female donkey less than three years old (from a Nochri, surely it has not given birth). If its first child (after it was bought) is a male, it definitely is a Bechor (a firstborn, which is automatically a Korban), so he must give it to a Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he buys one above three years old (perhaps it already gave birth), if its first child (after it was bought) is a male, we are in doubt (perhaps it is a Bechor. We must wait for it to get a blemish, then it may be eaten. The owner need not give it to a Kohen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, we must say like above, that it was an exceptional ruling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "<i>va'Yisharnah</i> ha'Paros ba'Derech"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> They sang.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Zutra bar Tuviyah):</span> They faced the Aron and sang.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did they sing?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answers (R. Yochanan... ):</span> "Az Yashir Moshe...", "Hodu la'Shem... Hodi'u va'Amim Alilosav", the anonymous (Rashi; Tosfos - unspecified) Mizmor - "Mizmor Shiru la'Shem... Nifla'os Asah", "Hash-m Molach Yirgezu Amim Yoshev Keruvim Tanut ha'Aretz", "Hash-m Molach Ge'us Lavesh" or 'Roni Roni ha'Shita... ''</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Parsim call a Sefer 'Devir.' Their source is "v'Shem Devir Lefanim Kiryas Sefer."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> They call a Nidah 'Dushtana', taken from "Derech NaSHim Li" (Rashi; Maharsha - they do not use a word solely for Nidah, just like the Torah said "Derech Nashim" in place of Nidah).</p>
