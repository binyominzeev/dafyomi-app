<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer:</span> When they run out of weapons, they use their shields to kill;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The lenient opinion holds that when they run out of weapons, they flee. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah is, we may sell shields to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> We may not sell to them slabs of iron.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because they make weapons from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should not sell shovels or axes either!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Zvid):</span> Rav Ada forbids only Indian iron, which is exclusively for making weapons.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we sell to them nowadays?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> We sell to the Persians, for they (protect the cities, and thereby) protect us.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SELLING WORK ANIMALS TO NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Calves and colts...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> We may sell a lame animal to a Nochri, because it cannot heal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> He will keep the animal to bear children! (People will see a Yisrael's animal with a Nochri, and come to sell healthy animals.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> It will never bear children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah holds that it will not allow a male to mate with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ben Beseira permits selling a horse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Ben Beseira):</span> A horse is permitted, because its work (carrying people) is not a desecration of Shabbos for which people are killed for (we say that people carry themselves);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rebbi says, a horse is forbidden for two reasons. It is like a weapon, and it is a work animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, it is like a weapon, for it kills fallen soldiers with its forelegs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it considered a work animal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> When it grows old, people make it turn a millstone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows Ben Beseira.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one sell a fattened ox (R. Tam - an ox proper to be fattened)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This question is according to R. Yehudah and Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah permits selling a lame animal, for it will never be proper to work, but a fattened ox will become proper if left for a while!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim forbid selling a lame animal, for it was not sold to be eaten (perhaps he will keep it to bear children), but a fattened ox is to be eaten!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that Romi required Rebbi's house to give to them a fattened ox on every idolatrous festival. Rebbi paid them 40,000 coins to allow him to give it the next day instead. He paid them another 40,000 to allow him to give it after it was slaughtered. He paid another 40,000 to exempt him from it entirely.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He paid to abolish the practice because it is forbidden, lest the Nochri keep the ox for a while.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did he pay to give the ox on the next day instead?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that he intended to abolish the practice in stages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a fattened ox is left for a while, will it really become suitable for work?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Yes! A fattener told me that if it is left for a while, it will work twice as good as a normal ox.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SELLING CHAYOS TO NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not sell to Nochrim lions, bears or anything that will cause damage to the public;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We may not build with them buildings or scaffolds for execution, courthouses (where they judge capital cases), or stadiums (where people are thrown to (be gored by) bulls).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may build with them altars (they are not directly used to serve idolatry) and bathhouses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not help build the place where they put the idol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Chanan bar Rav Chisda citing Rav):</span> A large Chayah is like a small Behemah regarding Pirkus (quivering after slaughter. If a dangerously sick animal stuck out a limb but did not quiver after slaughter, it is forbidden, as if it died before the slaughter ended), but not regarding selling it to Nochrim (rather, it is always forbidden);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan himself):</span> It is the same also regarding selling it. It is permitted or forbidden, based on the local custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> We may not sell to Nochrim lions, bears or anything that will cause damage to the public.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> (Tame) lions that do not damage may be sold!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar Ula):</span> The Mishnah discusses a lame lion. It is like R. Yehudah (who permits selling large lame animals).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Lions do not work. All are considered lame (Rashi - R. Yehudah permits tame lions; Tosfos - even Chachamim permit them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Just like we may not sell large Behemos to Nochrim, we may not sell large Chayos, even where small Behemos are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Chanan is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Our Mishnah forbids selling lions, bears or anything that will cause damage to the public;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Large Chayos that do not damage are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Just like we may not sell large Behemos to Nochrim, we may not sell large Chayos, even where small Behemos are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> The Mishnah discusses a lame lion; it is like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Lions do not work. All are considered lame.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> Perhaps lions are not considered large Chayos, rather small Chayos (i.e. there is no question at all)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Chanan - Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> We may not sell lions, bears or anything that will cause damage to the public.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference #1:</span> If they did not damage, they would be permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference #2:</span> The Mishnah only listed lions and bears, which do not work, but large Chayos that work would be forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This refutes Rav Chanan (from the Mishnah itself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What work do large Chayos do?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Wild donkeys pull millstones.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE LAW OF PIRKUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A large Chayah has the same law as a small Behemah regarding Pirkus; I do not remember if I heard this from Rav or from Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Ashi:</span> Shmuel taught this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar Yirmeyah:</span> Rav taught this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Asi:</span> Rav Chama bar Gurya taught this in Rav's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rabah bar Yirmeyah heard this from Rav Chama bar Gurya, who learned it from Rav.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WE MAY NOT BUILD COURTS FOR THEM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not build...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> There are three types of Basilki (buildings): of Nochri kings, bathhouses, and storehouses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> Only those of kings are forbidden (they judge capital cases there).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rava):</span> All of them are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> We may not build with them Basilkiyos, courthouses, stadiums, or scaffolds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, we may not build with them Basilkiyos (buildings) <i>of</i> courthouses, stadiums, or scaffolds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When R. Eliezer was seized (for teaching Torah, they were going to force him to serve idolatry), the officer asked him 'why do you engage in such idle things?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> The Judge (Hash-m) is correct.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The officer (he thought R. Eliezer referred to him):</span> Since you accepted my words, I swear that I will free you.</p>
