<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source (that we may not sell anything attached)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> (It is a decree due to) "v'Lo Sechanem" - do not give to Nochrim Chaniyah (a place to stay) in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn a different law from "v'Lo Sechanem" - do not give to them Chen (praise them)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it com to teach only that, it would have said 'Lo Sechunam';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it says "v'Lo Sechanem" to teach both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We must learn another law from "v'Lo Sechanem" - do not give to them Chinam (a free gift)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it only came to teach those two, it should have said 'Lo Sechinam';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it says "v'Lo Sechanem" to teach all three laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "V'Lo Sechanem" - do not give to Nochrim Chaniyah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, do not give to them Chen (praise). Also, do not give to them Chinam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Tana'im argue about whether or not we may give a gift to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "Do not eat any Neveilah; to a Ger (Toshav, i.e. a Ben Noach who accepted to guard his seven Mitzvos)... Titenenah va'Achalah Oh Machor l'Nochri" - this only permits giving it (for a gift) to a Ger (Toshav), or selling it to a Nochri;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one may sell it to a Ger?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "La'Ger... Titenenah va'Achalah Oh Machor."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one may give it to a Nochri?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Titenenah va'Achalah Oh Machor l'Nochri."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> One may give or sell it to a Ger or Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah permits only what the Torah explicitly says, i.e. giving it to a Ger or selling it to a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Yehudah argue with R. Meir?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah meant like R. Meir says, it should not have said "Oh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Oh" teaches that we must do one of the two things said.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir learns from "Oh" that it is better to give it to a Ger than to sell it to a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah says, we already know this, because we are commanded to help support a Ger Toshav, but not Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LOOKING AT WOMEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Also, "v'Lo Sechanem" - do not give to them Chen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This supports Rav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may not say 'this Nochri is so beautiful.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Raban Gamliel was in Har ha'Bayis, and he saw a beautiful Nochris. He said "Mah Rabu Ma'asecha Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Turnusrufus' wife tried to seduce R. Akiva, he spit, laughed and cried:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He spit, because she was formed from a putrid drop (of semen);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He laughed, because he saw (through Ru'ach ha'Kodesh) that she would later convert and marry him;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>He cried due to her beauty, which would ultimately go to the grave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav admits that one may praise Hash-m for creating beautiful things.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who sees beautiful creations should say 'blessed is He who created such things in His world.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may not look at women!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Nishmarta mi'Kol Davar Ra" - one may not look at a beautiful woman, even if she is single, or at a married woman, even if she is ugly;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may not look at a woman's colored clothing, nor at animals or birds mating, even if they fill his field of vision, like the angel of death;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The angel of death is full of eyes. When a sick person is about to die, the angel of death stands over him, with a drop of poison on his sword;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>When the person sees him, he is seized with fear, his mouth opens, and the drop enters;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>The drop kills him, makes him decay, and makes his face turn green.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Raban Gamliel inadvertently saw the woman when he turned a corner. He did not know in advance to close his eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not look at a woman's colored clothing...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> It is forbidden even if it is on the wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> It is forbidden only if he knows whose clothing it is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava):</span> The Beraisa says he may not look at <i>a woman's</i> colored clothing. It does not say 'at (women's) colored clothing.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> It is forbidden only if she already wore the clothing, but not if it is new;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, it would be forbidden to give new clothing to a professional make alterations, for he will look at it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is no proof. Rav Yehudah taught that an animal breeder may himself insert the male's Ever into the female, even though we said that one may not look at animals mating!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You must say that one involved in his profession is not aroused to improper thoughts. This could also explain why we may give clothing to a professional!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The drop kills him...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This contradicts Shmuel's father!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel's father):</span> The angel of death told me that he would prefer to uncover the neck (where he slaughters a sick person), like one does to an animal. He refrains due to the honor of others around.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the drop cuts the Simanim of slaughter (the foodpipe and windpipe).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The drop makes him decay...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>This supports R. Chanina bar Kahana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Kahana):</span> To prevent a corpse from decaying, one should move it so the mouth faces down (the drop will drip out).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Nishmarta mi'Kol Davar Ra" - one may not think (about women) during the day, lest this cause a seminal emission an night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir):</span> One can climb in levels of serving Hash-m as follows. Torah leads to carefulness; carefulness leads to zealousness, which leads to cleanliness (from sin), then to separation (from what is permitted, to be stringent), then to purity (of deeds), then to Kedushah, then to humility, then to fear of sin, then to Chasidus (going beyond the letter of the law), then to Divine inspiration, and this leads to revival of the dead;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chasidus is the highest level - "Az Dibarta v'Chazon la'Chasidecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span>This is unlike R. Yehoshua ben Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Humility is the highest level - "Ru'ach Hash-m... Levaser Anavim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Only the humble will receive these tidings, and not Chasidim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SELLING ON CONDITION TO DETACH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not sell to Nochrim...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> We may sell to them a tree on condition to cut it, and he must cut it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Meir says, we may sell to them only a cut tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> We may sell to them fodder or Kamah (attached grain) on condition to cut it, and he must cut it (in the Rif's text, fodder comes after Kamah; the coming Gemara (f:1-2) supports this);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Meir says, we may only sell to them what is already cut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>They must argue in all three cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had they argued only about a tree, one might have thought that only there R. Meir forbids. We are concerned lest he delay cutting it, for there is no loss;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, R. Meir would permit Kamah. One would not delay cutting it, lest he suffer a loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had they argued only about a tree or Kamah, one might have thought that only there R. Yehudah permits. We are not concerned lest he will delay, for there is no visible gain;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, regarding fodder, we suspect lest he delay, for there is a visible gain, and R. Yehudah would forbid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had they argued only about fodder, one might have thought that only there R. Meir forbids, lest he delay, for there is a visible gain;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, regarding the others, also R. Meir would permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May we sell an animal (that is usually bought for work) on condition to slaughter it immediately?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps R. Yehudah permits only what is attached (to the land). Since it is on the Yisrael's land, he can ensure that the Nochri will not delay, but if one sells an animal, the Nochri can delay as long as he wants!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> We may sell to them an animal on condition to slaughter it, and he must slaughter it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Meir says, we may sell to them only a slaughtered animal.</p>
