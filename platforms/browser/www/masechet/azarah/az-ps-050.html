<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MARKULIS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yishmael forbids if they are next to Markulis (and Chachamim argue)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This means that they are next to (but outside) its four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael holds that it is common to make a small Markulis near a big Markulis. Three rocks are a small Markulis, therefore three are forbidden, and two are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that it is not common to make a small Markulis near a big Markulis. Whether there are two or three rocks, they are forbidden only if they are seen with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We said that if they are very close to Markulis, all forbid, for perhaps they fell from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If stones that fell from Markulis can be seen with Markulis, they are forbidden. If not, they are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael says, three stones (together) are forbidden. Two are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> The Beraisa should say 'stones that <i>are found near</i> Markulis.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> R. Yishmael forbids two stones!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> Two stones in one Tefisah (they can be grabbed at once with Markulis, Rashi - and they are within four Amos of it) are forbidden. If they are in two Tefisos (i.e. not in the same Tefisah), they are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of two Tefisos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a barrier between them and Markulis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Two stones do not comprise Markulis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Stones of Beis Kulis are two stones next to each other, and one on top of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> That refers to a primary Markulis (but a minor Markulis of even two stones is also worshipped).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The house of King Yanai was destroyed. Nochrim erected Markulis. Other Nochrim (who do not worship Markulis) took the stones and used them for roads. Some Chachamim refrained from using those roads, but other Chachamim used them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> If (R. Menachem b'Rebbi Simai,) the son of Kedoshim uses them, how can we refrain?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he called the son of Kedoshim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He (R. Menachem) would not even look at the image on a coin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did some Chachamim refrain?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like Rav Gidal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> Takroves (something offered to idolatry) can never be Batel - "va'Yitzamedu l'Va'al Pe'or va'Yochelu Zivchei Mesim";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like a Mes is never Batel (it is always forbidden), also Takroves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>The Chachamim who used the roads hold that Takroves is forbidden only if it was offered similar to Avodas Penim (in the Mikdash. Stones of Markulis are forbidden because they were idolatry itself. Bitul, i.e. building them into the road, permits them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Yirmeyah - Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri took stones from Markulis and used them for roads, they are permitted. If a Yisrael did so, they are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">50b----------------------------------------50b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef bar Aba:</span> No Chacham can explain this Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> I am not such a great Chacham, but I can explain it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yosef could not explain it due to Rav Gidal's law (Takroves can never be Batel);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Tana holds that only Takroves like Avodas Penim is forbidden, therefore the stones (which were only thrown) are not Takroves, rather idolatry. A Nochri can be Mevatel idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HELPING TREES IN 'SHEMITAH' AND DURING 'CHOL HA'MO'ED'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Yirmeyah - Beraisa):</span> We may remove worms from a tree and put fertilizer where bark fell off in Shemitah. These are forbidden during Chol ha'Mo'ed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not prune it (to encourage more growth) in Shemitah or on Chol ha'Mo'ed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may apply oil to a pruned tree in Shemitah or on Chol ha'Mo'ed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef bar Aba:</span> No Chacham can explain this Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> I am not such a Chacham, but I can explain it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rav Yosef consider it inexplicable?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It permits (removing worms and putting fertilizer) in Shemitah and forbids during Chol ha'Mo'ed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is not difficult. Only Melachos are forbidden in Shemitah, but not exertion. On Chol ha'Mo'ed, even exertion is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It permits putting fertilizer in Shemitah, but forbids pruning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is not difficult. One may prevent deterioration, but one may not improve!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> It permits putting fertilizer in Shemitah, and a Mishnah forbids this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may put fertilizer on young trees, wrap (the branches together so they will not droop on the ground; alternatively, wrap something around the tree to protect from the sun or the cold), cut the ends of the branches (some say - put ashes on them), and make a fence around them (Rambam - make a cover to provide shade), and water them in Erev Shemitah until Rosh Hashanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> These are forbidden in Shemitah itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We can explain as Rav Ukva bar Chama answered (elsewhere).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ukva bar Chama):</span> There are two kinds of digging under olive trees:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One kind improves the tree. It is forbidden (in Shemitah). The other kind is to cover roots that became exposed. It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, there are two kinds of putting fertilizer:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One sustains the tree. It is permitted. The other kind improves the tree. It is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> It permits applying oil in Shemitah and on Chol ha'Mo'ed. A Mishnah forbids this in Shemitah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may put oil on unripe figs, puncture them and put oil inside in Erev Shemitah until Rosh Hashanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> These are forbidden in Shemitah itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is not difficult. The Beraisa permits putting oil to sustain, and the Mishnah forbids putting oil to fatten the fruit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Sama brei d'Rav Ashi):</span> Rabah bar Yirmeyah could not explain why putting oil is permitted on Chol ha'Mo'ed, but putting fertilizer is forbidden. Both are to sustain!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW MUCH MUST THE 'AVODAH' RESEMBLE 'AVODAS PENIM'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> An idolatry that is served with a stick:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one breaks a stick in front of it, he is Chayav Misah. If one throws a stick in front of it, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Breaking a stick is liable, for this is like slaughter (of Kodshim, in which the neckbone is broken);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also throwing is like Zerikah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Only throwing something that splits up is (like Zerikah of blood and is) liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one fed (Rashi; Tosfos - dirtied) an idol with excrement, or poured urine in front of it, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, pouring urine is throwing that splits up.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, why is he liable for excrement? It does not split up!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses liquid excrement (diarrhea).</p>
