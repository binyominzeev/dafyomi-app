<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yosi really forbid Zeh v'Zeh Gorem?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> We may plant a shoot of Orlah (only the fruit is forbidden, but not the wood), but not a nut of Orlah, because it is a fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Yosi admits that if a nut (Rashi - or shoots) of Orlah was planted, or the (Tosfos - and the resulting) shoots were reinserted into the ground or grafted, what grows is permitted. (One of the causes, i.e. the ground or the tree it was grafted onto, is permitted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Beraisa supports Rav Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yosi forbids Zeh v'Zeh Gorem only regarding idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa #1):</span> If a field was fertilized with manure of idolatry, or a cow was fattened with fodder of idolatry, one may sow the field and eat the cow;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> One must leave the field fallow (until the improvement of the fertilizer wears off), he may not eat the cow until it becomes thin again.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Beraisa #1 is like R. Yosi (he permits Zeh v'Zeh Gorem even regarding idolatry), and Beraisa #2 is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. One Beraisa is like R. Eliezer, one is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that R. Eliezer and Chachamim argue about Zeh v'Zeh Gorem?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah #1 - R. Eliezer):</span> If Se'or (sourdough, a fermenting agent) of Chulin and of Terumah fell into a dough, and there was not enough of either one to ferment the dough (make it become Chametz), and together they fermented it, the dough is like the last one that fell in. (If Terumah fell in last, only Kohanim may eat the dough, in Taharah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, no matter which fell in last, it is forbidden (to a non-Kohen, or b'Tum'ah) only if there was enough (Se'or of) Terumah to ferment it without the Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Eliezer permits (when the Chulin fell in last) only if the Terumah was removed before the Chulin fell in. If not, it is forbidden. (He forbids Zeh v'Zeh Gorem, and Chachamim permit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps also R. Eliezer permits Zeh v'Zeh Gorem (e.g. if they fell in at the same time). He forbids here only because we attribute the entire action to the final cause, whether or not the first cause was removed (unlike Abaye)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah #2):</span> If wood from an Asherah was used to heat a new oven (that was never heated before; the first heating solidifies the oven), the oven must be destroyed. If the wood was used to heat an old oven, it must cool down (before one may use it to bake);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one did not, rather, he baked in the forbidden oven or with the forbidden heat, the bread is forbidden. If the bread became mixed with other bread, one may not benefit from any of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, he takes the amount he benefited (Rashi - the cost of wood equal to that of the Asherah wood he used; Tosfos - the value of the loaf baked with that wood) and throws it in the sea. Then, he may benefit (Ba'al ha'Ma'or - but not eat; Ri - or even eat) from all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> One cannot redeem idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (We have partially answered Question (c); Mishnah #2 shows that R. Eliezer forbids Zeh v'Zeh Gorem.) Who are the Chachamim who argue with him, and permit?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They are the Chachamim of Mishnah #2.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They are more stringent than him! (He forbids Zeh v'Zeh Gorem, so all the more so they do!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are the Chachamim of Mishnah #1.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Granted, those Chachamim permit Zeh v'Zeh Gorem regarding Se'or, but perhaps they forbid regarding idolatry! (We said (b) that Chachamim and R. Eliezer argue about Zeh v'Zeh Gorem regarding idolatry.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Indeed (like we said above (a:5:ii), Beraisa #1 is like R. Yosi. He permits Zeh v'Zeh Gorem even regarding idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi addresses Chachamim according to their reasoning. I myself permit Zeh v'Zeh Gorem. Since you forbid it, you should forbid vegetables even in winter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim permit, like Rav Mari taught (the gain due to the leaves is offset by the loss due to the shade).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Amram):</span> A certain garden is fertilized by (blood of Korbanos to) idolatry. What is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Rav Yehudah taught that the Halachah follows R. Yosi (the Peros are permitted).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BENEFIT FROM IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If wood from an Asherah was used to heat a new oven, it must be destroyed. If the wood was used to heat an old oven, it must cool down;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one baked in the forbidden oven or with the forbidden heat, the bread is forbidden. If the bread became mixed with other bread, one may not benefit from any of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, he takes the amount he benefited and throws it in the sea, then all the loaves are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> One cannot redeem idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If wood from an Asherah was used to make a Karkar (a weaving tool), one may not benefit from it. If it was used to weave a garment, the garment is forbidden. If the garment became mixed with other garments, (and these garments became mixed with other garments - R. Tam deletes this from the text), one may not benefit from any of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer says, he takes the amount he benefited and throws it in the sea, then he may benefit from all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> One cannot redeem idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Mishnah needed to teach both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only the Reisha, one might have thought that only there R. Eliezer permits (via throwing the benefit into the sea), because the Isur (the wood) has been consumed before the bread is finished, but regarding the Karkar, the Isur remains intact, so one cannot throw away money to permit the garment;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only the Seifa, one might have thought that only there Chachamim argue, because the Isur remains intact, but regarding the bread, they agree to R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Therefore, it needed to teach that they argue in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> The Halachah follows R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> This applies only to bread, but if a barrel of Yayin Nesech (wine offered to idolatry) was mixed with permitted wine, it cannot be permitted (by throwing its value in the sea);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This permits even wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A barrel of Yayin Nesech was mixed with Reuven's wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Take four Zuz and throw them in the river. This permits you to benefit from (but not drink) the wine.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>'BITUL' OF AN 'ASHERAH'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri took from it (for his needs) chips, sticks or branches, even a leaf, it is Batel;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he shaved off pieces for its sake (to beautify it), it is forbidden. If he did so for his own needs, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law of the shavings?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna or Chiya bar Rav):</span> They are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of Rav Huna and Chiya bar Rav):</span> They are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (for the latter opinion - Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri shaved off pieces of idolatry for his own needs, it and the shavings are permitted. If he did so for its sake, it is forbidden, and the shavings are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Yisrael shaved off pieces, whether for his own needs or for its sake, it and the shavings are forbidden (because a Yisrael cannot be Mevatel idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If an idolatry broke (by itself), every piece requires Bitul;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Idolatry becomes Batel (if it broke) the way it grows (e.g. leaves fell off).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Just the contrary, it is not Batel the way it grows!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, idolatry (that broke) only <i>requires</i> Bitul (if it broke) the way it grows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav holds that idolaters worship fragments of idolatry, and Shmuel holds that theydu worship fragments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No, all agree that fragments are worshipped;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about fragments of fragments. Rav forbids them, and Shmuel permits them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> All permit fragments of fragments. They argue about an idolatry consisting of rings that can be easily assembled:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav says that it does not become Batel when it breaks, because anyone can easily assemble it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel says, idolatry requires Bitul only (if it broke) the way it grows. This did not break the way it grows, so it does not need Bitul.</p>
