<p class="dedicationbox">AVODAH ZARAH 8 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ADDITIONAL REQUESTS IN PRAYER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah is, one may request his needs in 'Shome'a Tefilah.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah brei d'Rav Shmuel bar Shilas):</span> Even though one may request his needs in 'Shome'a Tefilah', he may add requests in each of the (13 middle) blessings at the end.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> Even though one may request his needs in 'Shome'a Tefilah', if someone in his family was sick, he requests for him in the blessing for sick people. If he needs sustenance, he requests in the blessing of prosperity.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Even though one may request his needs in 'Shome'a Tefilah', he may request at length after Shemoneh Esreh, even like the confession of Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THEIR FESTIVALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> These are the festivals (for which the three preceding days are forbidden): Kalandra, Saturnura, Karteisim, the day of the king's Ginusiya (coronation), the king's birthday, and the day (of the year) that the king's father died;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, the day of death is an idolatrous festival only if they burned his Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The day that he (Rashi - any Nochri; Ra'avad - the king) shaves his beard, or his Bluris (a growth of hair which was only cut once a year for the sake of idolatry), the day he arrived from a sea voyage or left prison, or (Ra'avad - any Nochri) that makes a feast in honor of his son's wedding, only that day and that Nochri are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Chanan bar Rava):</span> Kalandra is an eight-day festival after Tekufas Teves. Saturnura is an eight-day festival before the Tekufah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A way to remember this is "Achor va'Kedem Tzartani" (the latter festival is listed first).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Adam ha'Rishon saw that the days were getting shorter. He assumed that this was the death decreed due to his sin, that the days would keep getting shorter, until there would be permanent darkness, and the world would revert to emptiness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He fasted and prayed for eight days. After the Tekufah, he saw that the days were getting longer, and realized that it is the nature of the world for the days to get shorter and longer. He made an (annual) eight-day festival.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The next year, he also made an annual festival of the eight days he fasted and prayed before the Tekufah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He fixed the festivals to praise Hash-m. Nochrim made them idolatrous festivals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that Adam was created in Tishrei. From the day he was created, the days kept getting shorter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to the opinion that Adam was created in Nisan, he had seen that the days get longer and shorter!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Before his sin, he never saw them get as short as they are in winter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> On the day that Adam was created, when the sun set; he assumed that this was the death decreed on him, that there would be permanent darkness, and the world would revert to emptiness;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He and Chavah fasted and cried that night. When morning came, he realized that such is the nature of the world. He offered an ox that Hash-m had brought up from the ground upright, its horns (Keranos) before its feet (Perasos) - "mi'Shor Par Makrin Mafris";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The ox that Adam offered had one horn on its forehead. It says "Makrin".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Makrin" is a plural form!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is written missing the 'Yud', which suggests the singular (mi'Keren).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Masnah):</span> If Rome celebrates Kalandra, and the surrounding cities are subservient to Rome, may one do business with them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Kalandra is forbidden to all (Rashi; Rashba - to all who celebrate it);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> The Isur applies only to those who celebrate it (Rashba - sincerely, i.e. Rome, but not the cities that celebrate because they fear Rome).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> Rome celebrates Kalandra, and the surrounding cities are subservient to Rome. The Isur applies only to those who (Rashba - sincerely) celebrate it. (This clause is the support. The Gemara brings the rest of the Beraisa, anyway.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We forbid before the following festivals - Saturnura, Karteisim, the day of Ginusiya, the king's birthday, and the day that the king's father died. After them is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The day a Nochri makes a feast in honor of his son's wedding, we forbid only that day and that Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PERSONAL FESTIVALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> ... The day he shaves his beard, or his Bluris, the day he arrived from a sea voyage or left prison, only that day and that Nochri are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> 'That day' excludes the days before and after. What does 'that Nochri' exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes people who are subservient to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> Yisraelim in Chutz la'Aretz serve idolatry unknowingly. A Nochri makes a feast in honor of his son's wedding, and invites all the Yisraelim in the city. Even though they eat their own food and drink, and a Yisrael serves them, the Torah considers this an idolatrous feast - "v'Kora Lecha v'Achalta mi'Zivcho."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is only if the Yisrael eats!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> "V'Kora Lecha" is extra to teach that from the time he agrees to go, it is as if he ate.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Within 30 days after the wedding one may not go, even if the Nochri did not say that it is due to the wedding;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After 30 days, it is forbidden only if he says that it is due to the wedding;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For how long after the wedding is it forbidden when he says that it is due to the wedding?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It is for 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From when does the Isur begin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It is from when they plant barley in a trough (to pass in front of the bride and groom for an omen to be fruitful; Rashi - or, when they start soaking barley to make beer for the wedding).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against answer (g)):</span> We are concerned even after 12 months!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yitzchak brei d'Rav Mesharshiya went to a Nochri's house after 12 months. He heard them thanking (their idolatry for helping them to get him to come), so he did not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For a great person, even after 12 months is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN ROME SEIZED POWER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> And Karteisim...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is the day that Rome seized power.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Karteisim and the day that Rome seized power... .</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Rome seized power twice, when they conquered Kleopatra, and when they conquered Yavan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> Rome made 32 battles against Yavan and was unable to conquer them, until they joined with Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>They stipulated (with Yisrael) 'if we become the kings, we will appoint you to be the mayors. If you become the kings, you will make us the mayors.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rome (to Yavan):</span> Until now, we fought. Now, let us judge who should rule!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there are a pearl and a (more) precious stone, which should be the setting for the other?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yavan:</span> The pearl is the setting.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rome sent similar questions, and Yavan answered that a precious stone should be the setting for carbuncle (a more precious stone). Carbuncle should be the setting for a Sefer Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rome:</span> The Sefer Torah and Yisrael are with us!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rome overcame Yavan. For 26 years they fulfilled their promise to Yisrael. After that, they subjugated Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they first honor it, and later stop?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> At first they expounded "v'Elchah l'Negdecha" (Esav will be even with Yakov). Later, they expounded "Ya'avor Na Adoni Lifnei Avdo" (Esav will be a master over Yakov).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that they fulfilled their promise for 26 years?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the following teaching (which concludes on the next Daf).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana citing R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> Rome subjugated Yisrael 180 years before the Churban (of the second Mikdash). Eighty years before the Churban, Chachamim decreed that Chutz la'Aretz is Tamei and that glass Kelim receive Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Forty years before the Churban, the Great Sanhedrin exiled itself to Chanus (a place).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer: (Rav Yitzchak bar Avdimi):</span> After they exiled themselves, fines were not enforced.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that if not for R. Yehudah ben Bava, fines would have been forgotten from Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why would they be forgotten? Chachamim should teach them!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they would not have been enforced, for Rome decreed to kill anyone who gives Semichah (ordination, which is necessary to collect fines) or receives Semichah, and to destroy the city and its outskirts where Semichah was given;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Yehudah ben Bava went between two mountains, between two cities, between their outskirts, and gave Semichah to R. Meir, R. Yehudah, R. Yosi, R. Shimon, and R. Elazar ben Shamu'a (Rav Avya adds, also R. Nechemyah). (They lived long after the Sanhedrin was exiled, and they collected fines!)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>When the troops of Rome found out, R. Yehudah ben Bava told them 'flee. I will remain here.' They pierced him with 300 iron spears.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Rather, after they exiled themselves, capital punishment was not enforced.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the Sanhedrin's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There were too many murderers, and they could not judge them all. They reasoned that it is better to be in exile, so the murderers will not be liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Min ha'Makom ha'Hu" - capital punishment can be sentenced only if the Great Sanhedrin is in its place (in Lishkas ha'Gazis in the Mikdash).</p>
