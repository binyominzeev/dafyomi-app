<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MIXTURES WITH 'YAYIN NESECH'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Yayin Nesech (R. Tam; Ramban - the same applies to all wine of Nochrim) is forbidden. (If it was mixed with other wine,) it forbids b'Mashehu (any amount).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If wine mixes with water or water mixes with wine, it (the forbidden liquid) forbids b'Nosen Ta'am (if it can be tasted in the mixture; Rif - if it improves the taste, i.e. at least one part in seven is wine, such a mixture is considered wine);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The general rule is:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Min b'Mino (if Isur (forbidden food) was mixed with the same variety of Heter (permitted food)), it forbids b'Mashehu;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Lo b'Mino (if different varieties mixed), it forbids b'Nosen Ta'am.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one pours Yayin Nesech from a barrel into a pit of wine, even for an entire day, each bit poured in becomes Batel (it is all permitted) (Tosfos - if all the Yayin Nesech is less than one part in 60 of the Heter wine; Ra'avad - as long as he does not pour this much Yayin Nesech (one part in 60 of the Heter wine) in at one time (i.e. without stopping); Rashi - even if he pours in this amount at once).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Yayin Nesech is forbidden. It forbids b'Mashehu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is even if Yayin Nesech fell into Heter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is if Heter fell into Yayin Nesech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If wine mixes with water, it forbids b'Nosen Ta'am.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Asur wine fell into Heter water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, Heter wine fell into Asur water (e.g. the water was Ne'evad).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since this clause discusses Asur water, also the next clause (if water mixes with wine, it forbids b'Nosen Ta'am) does. This refutes Rav Dimi, who says that each bit is Batel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the entire Mishnah discusses Heter that fell into Isur. The Seifa discusses Heter water that fell into Asur wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one pours Yayin Nesech from a small flask into a pit of wine, even for an entire day, each bit poured in becomes Batel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if he pours from a small flask. If he pours from a barrel, it flows in a large stream, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> If Yayin Nesech fell into a pit of wine, and also water fell in, we ignore the Heter wine. If there is enough water to Mevatel the Yayin Nesech, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah citing R. Yochanan):</span> Ravin's law applies only if the water fell in before the Yayin Nesech - but if the Yayin Nesech fell in first, it forbids the whole pit (and there is not enough water to Mevatel all the wine in the pit).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Mishnah says that Yayin Nesech is forbidden and forbids b'Mashehu. This is only if water did not fall in also;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If water also fell in, we ignore the Heter wine, and if there is enough water to Mevatel the Yayin Nesech, it is permitted. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make if Rav Shmuel explained the Mishnah or Ravin's law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he explained the Mishnah, he does not distinguish whether the water fell in before or after the Yayin Nesech;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he commented on Ravin, he teaches that if the water did not fall first, it does not Mevatel the Yayin Nesech.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IGNORING THE PERMITTED WINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> If Yayin Nesech fell into a pit containing wine of Heter and water</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">73b----------------------------------------73b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> If the Isur increased (Rashi - i.e. the pit contained wine of Heter, and water and Yayin Nesech fell in, in either order; Tosfos - the water fell in after the wines already mixed and were all forbidden), the mixture is forbidden (there is not enough water to Mevatel all the wine);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Heter increased (the pit contained Yayin Nesech, water fell in (and was Mevatel it), and later wine of Heter fell in), it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even if the Isur increased (Rashi - and the water preceded the Yayin Nesech), it is permitted</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Chizkiyah and R. Yochanan argue as R. Eliezer and Chachamim do!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If Se'or of Chulin and of Terumah fell into a dough, and there was not enough of either one to be Mechametz the dough, and together they made it Chametz, the dough is like the last one that fell in;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, no matter which fell in last, it is forbidden (to a non-Kohen) only if there was enough (Se'or of) Terumah to be Mechametz it without the Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Zeira):</span> No. Abaye taught that this is only if the Terumah was removed before the Se'or fell in. If it was not removed, R. Eliezer forbids in both cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In our case, the Isur was not removed. Chizkiyah is like neither Tana (R. Eliezer would forbid whether Isur or Heter increased, and Chachamim would permit)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Rather, they argue about whether we ignore (the permitted wine). Chizkiyah says that we do not ignore it (when Isur increased). R. Yochanan says that we do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan was unsure whether we ignore!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Asi):</span> If two cups of wine (diluted with water) got mixed together, one was Chulin, the other was Terumah, what is the law? (There was 60 (R. Yitzchak - six) times as much water as Terumah wine, but not 60 (R. Yitzchak - six) times as much as all the wine. Do we ignore the Chulin wine?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan was unable to answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Originally, he was unsure. Later, he concluded that we ignore.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (R. Ami citing R. Yochanan):</span> If two cups of diluted wine, Chulin and Terumah, got mixed, we ignore the Chulin wine, and the water (if there is enough) is Mevatel the Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHICH 'ISURIM' FORBID <i>B'MASHEHU?</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The general rule is: Min b'Mino forbids b'Mashehu. Lo b'Mino forbids b'Nosen Ta'am.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> All forbidden foods, if mixed b'Mino, forbid b'Mashehu. If mixed Lo b'Mino, they forbid b'Nosen Ta'am;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah says 'the general rule is' to include all forbidden foods.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> Only Tevel (Tosfos - and other Isurim that have Matirim, i.e. one has a permitted way or time to eat them (without incurring a loss), such as Shemitah, Ma'aser Sheni, and Hekdesh) and Yayin Nesech forbid b'Mashehu Min b'Mino, and Lo b'Mino, b'Nosen Ta'am;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Everything else forbids b'Nosen Ta'am, whether b'Mino or Lo b'Mino.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah says 'the general rule is' to include Tevel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav and Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> All forbidden foods, if mixed b'Mino, forbid b'Mashehu. If mixed Lo b'Mino, they forbid b'Nosen Ta'am.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> All forbidden foods forbid b'Nosen Ta'am, whether b'Mino or Lo b'Mino; (Note - normally, b'Mino the Isur tastes like the Heter; it is Batel in 60- Chulin 98a.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The only exceptions are Tevel and Yayin Nesech. If mixed b'Mino, they forbid b'Mashehu. Lo b'Mino, they forbid b'Nosen Ta'am.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, we are more stringent about Yayin Nesech due to the severity of idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why are we more stringent about Tevel (Tosfos - even when it does not have Matirim)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Its Isur resembles the way it becomes permitted:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Separating even one grain of Terumah permits any quantity of Tevel (mid'Oraisa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> Tevel forbids b'Mashehu b'Mino. Lo b'Mino, it forbids b'Nosen Ta'am (because the above reasoning does not apply).</p>
