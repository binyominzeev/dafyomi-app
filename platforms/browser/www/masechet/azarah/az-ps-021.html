<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RENTAL AND SALE OF HOUSES AND FIELDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> We may not (sell or) rent houses to Nochrim in Eretz Yisrael, and all the more so fields;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Surya we may rent (but not sell) houses, but not fields;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In Chutz la'Aretz we may (even) sell houses and rent fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, in Eretz Yisrael we may rent (but not sell) houses, but not fields;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Surya we may sell houses and rent fields;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In Chutz la'Aretz we may sell houses and fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Even when one may rent houses, it cannot be for the Nochri to live in, for he would bring in his idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is forbidden - "v'Lo Savi So'evah El Beisecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>In all places one may not rent to him a bathhouse, for people call it the Yisrael's bathhouse (and they will think that he authorized heating the water on Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does it say 'all the more so fields'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Two Isurim are involved with fields. It gives the Nochri Chaniyah (encampment), and it annuls Ma'aseros from the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also a house entails two Isurim. It gives the Nochri Chaniyah, and it uproots the Mitzvah of Mezuzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> The Mezuzah is a Mitzvah incumbent on the one living there. (It is not a Mitzvah on the house, so nothing is uprooted. Suggestion (f) is accepted; it answers Question (e).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In Surya we may rent houses...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Selling is forbidden. Presumably this is a decree lest one sell in Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should likewise forbid renting!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Renting is forbidden only due to a decree, lest one come to sell;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not make a decree due to a decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may not rent fields in Surya. This is a decree due to a decree!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Tana holds that Kivush Yachid (Rashi - territory conquered without consulting Hash-m or without all of Yisrael; Tosfos - anything conquered improperly, i.e. before conquering all of Eretz Yisrael) is valid conquest (therefore, Surya is considered like Eretz Yisrael. Therefore, renting in Surya is a decree due to selling there, which is forbidden mid'Oraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim decreed against renting fields, for one who sells transgresses two Isurim. They did not decree against renting houses, because one who sells transgresses only one Isur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In Chutz la'Aretz we may sell houses and rent fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We only decree against selling fields, because (in Eretz Yisrael) two Isurim are involved. We do not decree against selling houses.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>R. YOSI'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yosi says, in Eretz Yisrael we may rent houses...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He decrees only against renting fields, because two Isurim are involved with (selling) fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In Surya we may sell houses...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that Kivush Yachid is not considered conquest (Surya is not part of Eretz Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He decrees only against selling fields, for two Isurim are involved (in Eretz Yisrael) with fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In Chutz la'Aretz we may sell houses and fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it is far from Eretz Yisrael, we do not decree at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Even so, one may not sell to a Nochri if it will create a neighborhood of Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered a neighborhood?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> A neighborhood is at least three people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest the Nochri sell to two others, creating a neighborhood!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is a remote concern. We need not be concerned for it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>RENTING TO KUSIM AND NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even where one may rent houses...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> There are places where one may not rent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like R. Meir, for R. Yosi permits renting houses in all places.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In any place, he may not rent...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> One may not rent his bathhouse to a Nochri, for people call it the Yisrael's bathhouse, and they will think that the Yisrael asked the Nochri to work on Shabbos and Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one rent it to a Kusi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, Kusim do (even forbidden) work on Chol ha'Mo'ed, but even a Yisrael may heat water for bathing on Chol ha'Mo'ed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one rent his field to a Nochri (in Chutz la'Aretz, where we are not concerned for Chaniyah or Ma'aseros? Are we concerned lest people think he works for the Yisrael)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People will assume that the Nochri is a sharecropper, and he works for his own sake (he gets a share of the Peros).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should also permit renting a bathhouse for this reason!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People do not make such arrangements regarding bathhouses (they simply pay a daily wage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> One may not rent his field to a Kusi, for people call it the Yisrael's, and the Kusi will work on Chol ha'Mo'ed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May we infer that one may rent it to a Nochri, because people will assume that the Nochri is a sharecropper working for his own sake?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If so, we should also permit renting to a Kusi for the same reason!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon ben Elazar does not assume that people will say that the Nochri is a sharecropper.</p>
