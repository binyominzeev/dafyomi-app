<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PROTESTING AGAINST APPARENT TRANSGRESSIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>In Batzrah, Reish Lakish saw Yisraelim eating Peros without tithing them. He forbade them to do this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He saw them drink water that Nochrim had bowed to. He forbade this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Go retract immediately! Batzrah (is in Chutz la'Aretz, it) is not Betzer (the refuge city in Eretz Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One cannot forbid public water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that if the same water was privately owned, one could forbid it. Why is this? It is attached to the ground!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the water is detached (e.g. in a Keli).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> In any case, this is like rocks of a mountain that were uprooted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should be able to deduce that R. Yochanan forbids them (if they were Ne'evadim. However, he and Bnei R. Chiya argued about this, and we could not resolve who forbade and who permitted!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The case is, the Nochri took the water in his hands. This is not like rocks that were uprooted by themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Chiya bar Aba went to Gavla and saw three things. Benos Yisrael became pregnant through Nochrim who were circumcised but did not yet immerse (to convert), Yisraelim drank wine mixed by Nochrim, and Yisraelim ate lupines cooked by Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He did not say anything to them. He told R. Yochanan, who told him to announce that their children are Mamzerim, their wine is (forbidden like) Yayin Nesech, and their lupines are forbidden due to Bishul Akum because they are not Bnei Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Their children are Mamzerim, like R. Yochanan taught elsewhere, that a convert is a Nochri until circumcision and immersion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a Nochri or slave had relations with a Bas Yisrael, the child is a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Their wine is Yayin Nesech, due to 'Lech Lech... '</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Their lupines are forbidden as Bishul Akum because they are not Bnei Torah (if we would permit them, they would treat Bishul Akum lightly), but they are permitted to Bnei Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak taught Bishul Akum does not apply to anything that can be eaten raw! (Lupines are not eaten raw. They should be forbidden to everyone.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan holds like a different teaching;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> Bishul Akum does not apply to anything not proper for a king's table (lupines are not proper).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>'NOCHRIM' WHO DEAL WITH OUR WINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May a Nochri help a Yisrael carry grapes to the Gas?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> It is forbidden due to 'Lech Lech... '</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yemar - Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri brought grapes to the Gas in baskets, even if the juice is flowing on the grapes, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">59b----------------------------------------59b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> I agree that b'Di'eved it is permitted. I forbid only l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A Nochri's Esrog fell into a barrel of wine; he ran and stuck his hand in to retrieve it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi (to Yisraelim):</span> Hold his hand so he cannot shake it (and forbid benefit from the wine), and tilt the barrel so the wine will flow out (into another Keli. If the Nochri would remove the Esrog, even if Yisraelim were holding his hands, we would be concerned for Nisuch.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> If a Nochri b'Mezid was Menasech Reuven's wine, Reuven may ask him for its full (initial) value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this permitted? (This is like selling Yayin Nesech to him!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Nochri forbade it to Reuven. It is as if he burned it. Reuven collects payment for the damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi for himself - Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri was Menasech Reuven's wine not in front of idolatry, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Yehudah ben Bava and R. Yehudah ben Beseira permit it for two reasons:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nisuch is done only in front of idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>No one else can forbid Reuven's wine against his will. (Rashi - this shows that Reuven is entitled to collect damages from him; Tosfos - if some Tana'im permit the wine, it is unlikely that other Tana'im are so stringent to forbid taking its value from the Nochri.)</p>
