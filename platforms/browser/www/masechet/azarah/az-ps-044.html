<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW TO DESTROY IDOLS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> "... Ha'Egel Lakachti va'Esrof Oso ba'Esh va'Ekos Oso Tachon... va'Ashlich Es Afaro El ha'Nachal." (Moshe ground up the golden calf and threw the dust to the river, even though it will be deposited on the banks!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> "Va'Yizer Al Penei ha'Mayim va'Yashk Es Bnei Yisrael" - he made Yisrael drink it, to test them like Sotos (it killed those who were guilty).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> "Va'Yichros Asa Es Miflatztah va'Yadek va'Yisrof b'Nachal Kidron" (Asa ground up the idol in a valley. He was not concerned lest dust fly off and fertilize the valley)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> He did so in Nachal Kidron, because nothing grows there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> After blood was thrown against the Altar... it flows into the spring (that ran through the Mikdash) and flows into Nachal Kidron. Gardeners buy it. Me'ilah applies to it (Rashi - mid'Rabanan, if one uses it without paying Hekdesh; Rambam - mid'Oraisa).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Some places in Nachal Kidron can grow things. Other places cannot. (Asa threw the dust to a place where nothing grows.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is "Miflatztah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It was MaFLi LeiTZanuSAH (a wondrous mockery).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Ma'achah made a male organ for it, and she would have relations with it every day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> "V'Chitas Nachash ha'Nechoshes" (Chizkiyah ground up the snake-image of Moshe, even though people were worshipping it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> "Aseh <i>Lecha</i> Saraf" - it belonged to Moshe. Others could not forbid benefit from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was permitted to benefit from it. He ground it up because people were sinning through it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> "Va'Ya'azvu Sham Es Atzabeihem <i>va'Yisa'em</i> (they strewed (the ground-up idols)) David va'Anashav"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that va'Yisa'em means 'they strewed'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the Targum of "Tizrem v'Ru'ach Ti'sa'em."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> It says "va'Yisarefu ba'Esh." It does not say 'va'Yisrafem va'Yisa'um.' We must say that they burned it, but they did not strew it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Va'Yisa'em simply means that they carried it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verses contradict each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> Before Iti ha'Giti (a Nochri friend of David) came, they could not be Mevatel the idol, so they were burning it. After Iti came, he was Mevatel it, and they carried it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DAVID'S CROWN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "va'Yikach Es Ateres Malkam... u'Mishkalah Kikar Zahav... va'Tehi Al Rosh David." One may not benefit from idols!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Iti ha'Giti was Mevatel it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Kikar of gold (about 25 kilos) is too heavy for David to wear!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The verse means, it was <i>proper</i> to be on David's head.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> A magnet helped support most of its weight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Elazar):</span> It contained a precious stone worth a Kikar of gold (but it weighed much less).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Zos Haysah Li Ki Pikudecha Notzarti"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because David guarded Hash-m's Mitzvos, he was rewarded with testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the testimony?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> He donned the crown in the place of Tefilin, and it fit (miraculously - the crown was round, and the head is not round there)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He must wear Tefilin there!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> There is space on the head for two Tefilin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>"Va'Yitenu Alav (on Yo'ash) Es ha'Nezer" is the crown;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "V'Es ha'Edus" is testimony to the house of David. The crown fits only one who is proper to be king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Adoniyahu... Misnasei Leimor Ani Emloch" (he said 'I will reign') - he tried on the crown, but it did not fit him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "<i>Va'Ya'a</i>s... va'Chamishim Ish Ratzim Lefanav" - what did Adoniyahu <i>do</i> to the people who ran in front of him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> He removed their spleens and the skin of the bottom of their feet (so thorns would not hurt them, and they could run faster).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AFRODITI'S BATHHOUSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Fruklus (a Nochri Min) saw Raban Gamliel bathing in the bathhouse of Afroditi (an idol).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Fruklus:</span> This is forbidden to you - "Lo Yidbak b'Yadcha Me'umah Min ha'Cherem"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel:</span> We do not answer (matters of Torah) in a bathhouse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">After he left, he told him:</span> I did not come to Afroditi's domain. She came to my domain!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>People do not say 'let us build a bathhouse to glorify Afroditi', rather, 'let us put a statue of Afroditi in the bathhouse for decoration.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Also, if I would give to you a fortune, would you go to your idol naked, Tamei from seminal emissions, and urinate in front of it?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>She is by the trough, and everyone urinates by her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>We are forbidden to benefit only from "Eloheihem", i.e. what they treat like gods.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could Raban Gamliel say this there? ('We do not answer... ' is (a Halachah of) Torah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> One may think about Torah anywhere except for a bathhouse or bathroom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he did not say it in Lashon ha'Kodesh (and therefore it is permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Abaye taught that profane matters may be said (in a bathhouse or bathroom) even in Lashon ha'Kodesh. Torah may not be said there even in other languages!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> After he left (Ri - the inner room of the bathhouse, where one may not even greet someone with 'Shalom'), he said 'we do not answer in a bathhouse.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chama bar Yosef citing R. Oshaya):</span> Raban Gamliel did not give to him a proper answer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chama:</span> I myself say that it was a proper answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was it improper (according to R. Oshaya)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chama):</span> He said 'she is by the trough, and everyone urinates by her!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> People excrete in front of Pe'or (and the Torah forbids it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chama:</span> I say that it was a proper answer. That is the way to serve Pe'or, but for Afroditi, this is disgraceful!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> R. Oshaya considered it improper because he said 'I did not come to her domain. She came to my domain!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even had he come to her domain, it would be permitted (as long as he does not show gratitude)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there is a bathhouse or garden of idolatry, one may benefit from it only if he does <i>not</i> show gratitude to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> I say that it was a proper answer. Raban Gamliel was a great man. His benefit from it gives prestige to the idol. (It would be forbidden had he gone to her domain.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Simi bar Chiya):</span> He considered it improper because he said 'she is by the trough, and everyone urinates by her!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an idolater spat or urinated on his idol, or dragged it in mud or excrement, it is not Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chama bar Yosef:</span> I say that it was a proper answer. In the Mishnah, he was angry at the moment, so urinating on it does not Mevatel it, for later he will appease it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Here, because they always urinate by it, it is not considered idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rabah bar Ula):</span> He considered it improper because he said 'people do not say 'let us build a bathhouse to glorify Afroditi'; rather, 'let us put Afroditi in the bathhouse for decoration'';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if they would say 'let us build a bathhouse to glorify Afroditi', one may bathe there!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one says 'this house (or cup) should be for the idol,' nothing takes effect. There is no concept of 'Hekdesh' to idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar Ula:</span> I say that it was a proper answer. Granted, one may benefit from the bathhouse, but if bathing there glorified the idol, it would be forbidden (Rashi; Tosfos - mid'Oraisa, one may benefit from the bathhouse, for there is no Hekdesh to idols. However, if it was built to glorify the idol, it would be forbidden mid'Rabanan).</p>
