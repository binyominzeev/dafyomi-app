<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (and Answer #3 to Question (3)):</span> Beraisa #1 is Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - Rebbi):</span> If one of the lambs (Shalmei Tzibur) was slaughtered with intent to eat (Chutz li'Zmano) half a k'Zayis of one loaf and the other was slaughtered with intent to eat half a k'Zayis of the other, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is because he specified, half a k'Zayis from each. Had he said, a k'Zayis from both of them, they would join!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Which Tana (in our Mishnah) does Rebbi hold like?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He does not hold like Chachamim. They say that even intent for a k'Zayis from one of them is Mefagel both of them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he holds like R. Yosi, we must say that Beraisa #1 is like R. Yosi, so this does not answer the question (13b, 4:e)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (and defense of Answer #1 above (13b, 4:e:3)):</span> Really, Beraisa #1 is Chachamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It should not say, 'unless he was Mefagel bi'Shteihem (the feminine form of 'both', it refers to Shtei ha'Lechem), rather, 'bi'Shneihem' (the masculine form of 'both', i.e. he intended during Shechitah of both lambs). It suffices if he intended to eat from one loaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say this to oppose the opinion of R. Meir, who says that intent during the Avodah of part of the Matirim (in this case, one of the lambs) makes Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> If so, why does it say 'there is never Kares unless...'? (This connotes, even though one factor suggests that there should be Kares, another factor is needed.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Granted, if the Beraisa is R. Yosi, he opposes R. Meir and Chachamim. He teaches that even if he intended to eat from Shteihem (both loaves), there is not Kares unless he intended in Shneihem (both lambs);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, if it is Chachamim, they say this just to oppose R. Meir. They should have said 'there is not Kares unless...'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Rav Ashi proved otherwise from a Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar citing R. Yosi):</span> Intent to do (Chutz li'Zmano) an outer Avodah (i.e. outside the Heichal, but in the Azarah) takes effect. Such intent to do (or while doing) an inner Avodah does not take effect;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one slaughtered (an inner Chatas) outside with intent to do Haza'ah (an inner Avodah), it is not Pigul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If one did Haza'ah inside with intent to be Maktir Eimurim or be Zorek Shirayim (on the outer Mizbe'ach), it is not Pigul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If he slaughtered outside with intent to be Maktir Eimurim or be Zorek Shirayim, it is Pigul; for the action and intention were both outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When he intended to be Zorek Shirayim, what becomes Pigul?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The blood becomes Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> Pigul does not apply to the following (in most cases, because they do not have Matirim):</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Kometz, Levonah, Ketores, a Minchah of a Kohen, Minchas Nesachim, Minchas Chavitin (the daily Minchah of a Kohen Gadol), and blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The meat becomes Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Culmination of objection:</span> R. Yosi says that Pigul without intent for meat (rather, for Shirei Dam) is Mefagel meat. All the more so, Pigul with intent for meat (i.e. for one thigh) is Mefagel meat (the other thigh)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #3:</span> Ravina proved otherwise from the first Mishnah of our Perek!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yosi admits that if Kemitzah was done with intent to eat the Shirayim tomorrow or to be Maktir the Kometz tomorrow, the Minchah is Pigul, and there is Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When he intended to be Maktir the Kometz, what becomes Pigul?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Kometz becomes Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> Pigul does not apply to the following - the Kometz...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Shirayim become Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Culmination of objection:</span> R. Yosi says that Pigul without intent for Shirayim (rather, for the Kometz) is Mefagel Shirayim. All the more so, Pigul with intent for one thigh, which is part of a Korban, is Mefagel the other thigh!</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>R. YOSI'S SOURCE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 4:c, 13b - R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yosi learns from contradictory connotations in the verse of Shtei ha'Lechem:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They are considered to be one unit. If there are not two, it is Pasul. (Rashi - it says "Shtayim... Tihyenah." The root of Tihyenah is Havayah, which always teaches that something is Me'akev. Tosfos - "Tavi'u Lechem (singular) Tenufah" makes them like one.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The verse also calls them two ("Shtayim Shnei Esronim"). Each must be kneaded and arranged by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If one had a joint intent (e.g. to eat a k'Zayis (Chutz li'Zmano) from both of them together), they become Pesulim, for the Torah made them like one;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If his intent was individual (to eat only from one of them), only it becomes Pigul, for the Torah made them like two.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>(The verse teaches this about Shtei ha'Lechem, but intent for one thigh is Mefagel the other, like Rav Ashi and Ravina taught above. R. Yochanan argues with Rav Huna (13b).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> If one was Mefagel in (one kind of bread of) Lachmei Todah or Minchas Ma'afe Tanur, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Tachlifa - Beraisa):</span> The same applies to Lachmei Todah and Minchas Ma'afe Tanur. (R. Yosi and Chachamim argue like they do about Shtei ha'Lechem and Lechem ha'Panim.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN DO INTENTS JOIN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one intended during Shechitah to eat half a k'Zayis (Chutz li'Zmano), and during Zerikah he intended for half a k'Zayis, this makes Pigul, for Shechitah and Zerikah join.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Shechitah and Zerikah join, for both of them permit (Shechitah is Mekadesh the blood and permits Zerikah, and Zerikah permits the Eimurim to the Mizbe'ach (and in Korbanos that are eaten, it permits the meat to people). Kabalah and Holachah (do not permit, so) they do not join (with each other, or with Shechitah or Zerikah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Shechitah and Zerikah join, even though they are the first and last of the four Avodos. All the more so Kabalah and Holachah join (with each other or with Shechitah or Zerikah, for there is less time in between). (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Levi taught that the four Avodos (Shechitah, Kabalah, Holachah and Zerikah) do not join for Pigul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Beraisa is like Chachamim. Levi's teaching is like Rebbi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If one slaughtered a lamb (Shalmei Tzibur) with intent to eat half a k'Zayis of one loaf, and the other lamb with intent to eat half a k'Zayis of the other loaf, the lambs (and loaves) are Kesherim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> This shows that Rebbi holds that intents for partial Shi'urim during partial Matirim do not join, but perhaps he holds that such intents during (different) full Matirim join!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava bar Rav Chanan):</span> If Rebbi holds that intents for partial Shi'urim during full Matirim join, he should decree that such intents during partial Matirim join, lest people come to think that even the former do not join. We find that R. Yosi and Chachamim make such decrees!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> If one intended to be Maktir the Levonah tomorrow, the Minchah is Pasul, and there is no Kares. (This is a decree, due to intent for the Shirayim or Kometz);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, it is Pigul, and there is Kares. (The following proves that Chachamim also decree.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one was Mefagel (intended to eat the Shirayim Chutz li'Zmano during Haktarah of) the Kometz but not of the Levonah, or vice-versa, the Minchah is Pigul, and there is Kares (for eating the Shirayim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Chachamim say, there is no Kares unless he was Mefagel in (Avodah of) the entire Matir.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Inference:</span> There is no Kares, but it is Pasul. This is a decree due to one who was Mefagel in both Matirim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> No. In those cases, there is good reason to decree!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi decrees about intent to be Maktir a Kometz of Levonah, due to intent to be Maktir a Kometz of a Minchah (which makes Pigul);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim decree about Haktarah of a Kometz (by itself) and Levonah (by itself) due to cases in which this is the full Matir, i.e. Minchas Chotei (which has no Levonah) and Lechem ha'Panim (which has no Kometz);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim also decree (16a, Mishnah) to disqualify a lamb due to (when he would have intent also in) the other, and one spoon (of Levonah) due to the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Here, there is intent in only half a Matir for only half a k'Zayis. There is no need to decree!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> Chachamim agree with R. Meir that if one was Mefagel in the Kometz of Minchas Chotei or Minchas Kena'os, it is Pigul, and there is Kares, for the Kometz is the Matir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, there is no other Matir (they do not have Levonah). Why is it necessary to say this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that the reason Chachamim disqualify when he was Mefagel in the Kometz of Minchas Nedavah is due to the Kometz of Minchas Chotei (for then there is Kares.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>CAN A KORBAN TZIBUR BE DIVIDED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If one of the loaves (of Shtei ha'Lechem) or one Seder (of Lechem ha'Panim) became Tamei, both (loaves or Sedarim) are burned in Beis ha'Sereifah (a place outside the Azarah for burning Pasul Kodshim), for a Korban Tzibur is never divided (half Kosher and half Pasul);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, the Tamei one is burned, and the Tahor one is eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Elazar):</span> They argue in a case when it became Tamei before Zerikah (of the blood of the Shalmei Tzibur, or before Haktarah of Bazichei Levonah of Lechem ha'Panim). If it became Tamei after Zerikah, all agree that each is treated according to its status. (The Tamei one is burned, and the Tahor one is eaten.)</p></div>
