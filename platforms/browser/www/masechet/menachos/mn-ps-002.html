<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (In most Menachos (offerings made from fine flour), the Kohen inserts his middle three fingers into the Minchah and curls them back to his palm. What is within his hand is called a Kometz; it is burned on the Mizbe'ach.) If Kemitzah (taking a Kometz) of any Minchah was Lo Lishmah (with intent for a different Minchah, e.g. the Kohen said 'I take the Kometz l'Shem (for the sake of) Minchas Machavas (one cooked on a flat pan)', and it was really Marcheshes (cooked in a deep pan)), it is Kosher (we offer the Kometz, and the rest of the Minchah is eaten), but Lo Alu l'Shem Chovah (the owner was not Yotzei, i.e. he did not fulfill his obligation);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The only exceptions are Minchas Chotei (a very poor person brings this is for a Chatas for certain transgressions) and Minchas Kena'os (that a Sotah brings). If any of the following Avodos were done Lo Lishmah in either of them, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Kemitzah, Nesinah (putting the Kometz in a second Kli Shares (a Kodesh vessel used for Avodah), Holachah (bringing the Kometz to the top of the Mizbe'ach) or Haktarah (burning it on the Mizbe'ach).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is Pasul whether all of these Avodos were Lo Lishmah, or some Avodos were Lishmah and later Avodos were Lo Lishmah, or vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The case of Lishmah followed by Lo Lishmah is when Kemitzah (of a Minchas Chotei) was l'Shem Minchas Chotei, and a later Avodah was l'Shem Minchas Nedavah (a voluntary offering);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The case of Lo Lishmah followed by Lishmah is when- Kemitzah was l'Shem Minchas Nedavah, and a later Avodah was l'Shem Minchas Chotei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why did the Tana say but Lo Alu (l'Shem Chovah)? (He could have omitted this word!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that even though Lo Alu, the Minchah is still Kosher. One may not do another Avodah (Nesinah, Holachah or Haktarah) Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If an Olah was slaughtered Lo Lishmah, one may not do Zerikah Lo Lishmah. We can learn from reasoning or a verse:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Reasoning - because it was (improperly) slaughtered Lo Lishmah, should we do another Avodah Lo Lishmah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>A verse - "...v'Asisa Ka'asher Nadarta... Nedavah."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Torah call a Neder (a vow to bring a Korban with Acharayus, i.e. if the animal becomes lost or disqualified, he must bring another) 'Nedavah' (a Korban without Acharayus)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If you did like your Neder (i.e. the Korban was offered Lishmah), it is a Neder (you fulfilled your vow). If not, it is only a Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p>The Torah calls a Zevach slaughtered Lo Lishmah a Nedavah. One may not offer a Nedavah Lo Lishmah!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IS THE MISHNAH LIKE R. SHIMON?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah is unlike R. Shimon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Shimon):</span> If Kemitzah of any Minchah (even Minchas Chotei) was Lo Lishmah, it is Kosher and Alah (l'Shem Chovah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Menachos are unlike Zevachim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If Kemitzah was l'Shem Marcheshes and it was really (cooked in a) Machavas (such a Minchah is drier), this is evident (therefore, the intent has no effect);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If he did Kemitzah l'Shem Blulah (a Minchah mixed with oil) and it was really Charevah (without oil, i.e. Minchas Chotei), this is evident;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Zevachim are different. Shechitah and Zerikah are the same for all of them (therefore, Lo Lishmah is not Meratzeh (it is not Oleh l'Shem Chovah), and it is even Posel some Zevachim (Chatas and Pesach)).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not difficult for Rav Ashi, who says that R. Shimon is (fully) Machshir only when one said (about a Minchas Machavas) 'l'Shem Marcheshes' (without saying 'Minchah'). Our Mishnah is even like R. Shimon. The case is, he said 'l'Shem Minchas Marcheshes', all agree that Lo Alah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, Rabah and Rava say that R. Shimon argues in both cases. Must they say that the Mishnah is unlike R. Shimon?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they answer like Rabah says (below), that R. Shimon is Machshir only regarding Shinuy Kodesh (l'Shem the wrong Korban), but he admits about Shinuy Ba'alim (l'Shem the wrong owner. Since the Lo Lishmah is not evident, Lo Alah. This is the case in our Mishnah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Our Mishnah discusses Shinuy Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Lishmah followed by Lo Lishmah - (Kemitzah of Minchas Chotei was) l'Shem Minchas Chotei, and a later Avodah was l'Shem Minchas Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they answer like Rava says (below), that R. Shimon is Machshir only regarding a Minchah l'Shem a different Minchah, but he admits regarding a Minchah l'Shem a Zevach that Lo Alu (and our Mishnah discusses this).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Our Mishnah discusses a Minchah l'Shem a different Minchah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Lo Lishmah followed by Lishmah - Kemitzah was l'Shem Minchas Nedavah, and a later Avodah was l'Shem Minchas Chotei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Indeed, Rabah and Rava must say that the Mishnah is unlike R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN IS THE MINCHAH VALID ACCORDING TO R. SHIMON?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon contradicts what he said elsewhere!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Shimon):</span> "Kodesh Kodoshim Hi ka'Chatas vecha'Asham" - some Menachos are like Chatas, and some Menachos are like Asham:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Minchas Chotei is like Chatas. Therefore, if Kemitzah was Lo Lishmah it is Pasul, like Chatas Lo Lishmah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Minchas Nedavah is like Asham. Therefore, if Kemitzah was Lo Lishmah it is Kosher, like Asham Lo Lishmah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>However, if an Asham was Lo Lishmah, Lo Alah. The same applies to a Minchah Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> In Beraisa #1, R. Shimon discusses Shinuy Kodesh, he says 'Teratzeh'; in Beraisa #2, he discusses Shinuy Ba'alim. (Other answers to this question will be given on Daf 3b.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> A Hekesh teaches that Menachos are like Zevachim. Improper intent is Posel  This applies to Shinuy Kodesh and Shinuy Ba'alim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> R. Shimon says that it depends on whether or not the improper intent is evident. He expounds according to reasoning:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shinuy Ba'alim is not evident, so it is Posel. Shinuy Kodesh is evident (i.e. that this was not cooked in a Machavas) therefore the intent is Batel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If so, if Melikah of Olas ha'Of was done above (on the top half of the Mizbe'ach) l'Shem Chatas ha'Of, Teratzeh (it should be Kosher and Oleh l'Shem Chovah), for the Lo Lishmah is evident, since Chatas is done below!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Melikah of Chatas ha'Of may also be done above. (Therefore, it is not evident. This could be a Chatas);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Melikah anywhere on the Mizbe'ach is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If Mitzuy (squeezing out the blood) of Olas ha'Of was done above l'Shem Chatas ha'Of, Teratzeh, for the Lo Lishmah is evident;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chatas ha'Of is done below, and Haza'ah (sprinkling) is done with its blood!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is not evident. Also in Chatas ha'Of, Mitzuy is done (after Haza'ah), and Mitzuy anywhere on the Mizbe'ach is Kosher.</p></div>
