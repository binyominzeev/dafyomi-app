<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>KIDUSH L'CHATZA'IM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Elazar (above, 7b, 3:d:3) really say that blood is not Mekudash l'Chatza'im?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Chavitei Kohen Gadol do not become Mekudashos l'Chatza'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Since they are (offered) l'Chatza'im (half in the morning, half in the evening), they become Kadosh l'Chatza'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he holds that blood is not Mekudash l'Chatza'im, he should learn Chavitim from blood!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he does not learn a matter from a different matter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Elazar taught that if Kemitzah was done in the Heichal, it is Kosher, for we remove the Levonah from the Lechem ha'Panim in the Heichal, and this corresponds to Kemitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar learns (the law of) a Minchah from another Minchah, but not from blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He does not learn a Minchah from another Minchah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the Lechem ha'Panim was Nifras (became Chaser) before it (Rashi - the Lechem ha'Panim; Shitah Mekubetzes - the Levonah) was removed, the Lechem is Pasul. We are not Maktir the Levonah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was Nifras after it was removed, the Lechem is Pasul, and we are Maktir the Levonah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> When it says before (or after) it was removed, this really means before (or after) the time came for it to be removed. Once the time comes, it is as if it was removed.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We do not equate this to a Minchah that became Chaser before Kemitzah. (The Mishnah is Pasul. Even though the time came for Kemitzah, it is not as if Kemitzah was done!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kometz is unlike Levonah. We cannot consider it is as if was already taken, for we do not know which part of the Minchah will become the Kometz;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Lechem ha'Panim and Levonah are already distinct. (Therefore, once the time comes, it is as if they were removed.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Lechem becoming Nifras should be like Shirei Minchah that became Chaser in between Kemitzah and Haktarah. We are not Maktir the Kometz!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Amora'im argue about this, R. Elazar holds like the opinion that we are Maktir in this case.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Chavitei Kohen Gadol do not become Mekudashos l'Chatza'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Since they are l'Chatza'im, they become Kadosh l'Chatza'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha):</span> R. Yochanan learns from "Minchah... Machatzisah" - the Minchah must be brought (complete), then it is divided into halves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against R. Elazar - Beraisa):</span> Chavitim were not brought in halves. A full Isaron was brought, and divided into two;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Had it said 'Minchah...  Machatzis', this would teach that half an Isaron should be brought in the morning and offered, and similarly in the afternoon;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rather, it says "Machatzisah" - half of it (the complete Minchah, i.e. all of it is here).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is l'Chatchilah, but b'Di'eved, they become Kadosh l'Chatza'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Gaviha of Bei Kesil):</span> It says "Chukah"! (This always teaches that something is Me'akev.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Indeed, he must bring a full Isaron from his house, but it can be Mekudash l'Chatza'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> R. Yochanan taught differently (elsewhere)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one separated half an Isaron and intends to add more, it is not Kadosh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is Kadosh.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If R. Yochanan holds that Chavitim do not become Mekudashos l'Chatza'im, he should learn from them to this case!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he does not learn a matter from a different matter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The following teaches that he does (learn about the Heichal from the Azarah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If Shelamim was slaughtered in the Heichal, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It says "u'Shchato Pesach Ohel Mo'ed" - the Tefel (the Azarah, it is valid for Shechitah only because it faces the Heichal) should not be greater (more Kosher for Shechitah) than what is primary (the Heichal)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Intent to add more changes the law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Mele'im" - Klei Shares are Mekadesh only if they hold the complete quantity;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, this is only if he does not intend to complete the measure. If he intends, every amount put inside immediately becomes Mekudash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Rav said that if one separated half an Isaron and intends to add more, it is not Kadosh -) what is Rav's opinion regarding Chavitim l'Chatza'im?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he holds like R. Elazar (that they become Mekudash), he should learn from this, and half an Isaron should also become Kadosh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps (he does, but) he does not learn a matter from a different matter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He does!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a Minchah was brought without oil (even if it requires oil), it is Kadosh. We learn from Lechem ha'Panim, which does not contain oil;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If a Minchah was brought without Levonah, it is Kadosh. We learn from Minchas Nesachim, which has no Levonah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If it was brought without oil or Levonah, it is Kadosh. We learn from Minchas Chotei, which has neither.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav must hold like R. Yochanan. (Chavitim do not become Mekudashos l'Chatza'im.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MENACHOS WITHOUT OIL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a Minchah was brought without oil (even if it requires oil), it is Kadosh. We learn from Lechem ha'Panim, which does not contain oil;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Minchah was brought without Levonah, it is Kadosh. We learn from Minchas Nesachim, which has no Levonah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was brought without oil nor Levonah, it is Kadosh. We learn from Minchas Chotei, which has neither.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If oil or Levonah was brought by itself, it becomes Kadosh;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Oil becomes Kadosh by itself, like we find regarding the Log that a Metzora brings;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Levonah becomes Kadosh by itself, as we find regarding the Levonah of Lechem ha'Panim. (It is removed and offered by itself.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> If it (should have, but) lacks either oil or Levonah, it is not Kadosh.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (There was a measure in the Mikdash that held one Isaron. It was anointed with oil to Mekadesh it.) According to R. Chanina, why was it Mekudash? This is the amount of flour for a Minchah. There is no room for oil or Levonah, therefore it is not Mekadesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Mekadesh Minchas Chotei (which does not require oil or Levonah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Chanina, why was the measure of a Log Mekudash? (He says that oil alone is not Mekudash!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Mekadesh the oil that a Metzora brings (alone).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Shmuel holds like Rav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Klei Lach (Klei Shares that hold liquids) are Mekadesh (Kodshim) liquids. Dry measures are Mekadesh dry (Kodshim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Klei Lach are not Mekadesh dry, and dry measures are not Mekadesh liquids.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This applies only to (liquid) measures, but buckets (even though they hold liquids, i.e. blood) are Mekadesh dry;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We learn from the Menachos in the buckets donated by the Nesi'im - "Shneihem Mele'im Soles."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> A Minchah (is kneaded with oil. It) is like a liquid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> Surely, some of the flour was not kneaded well and it is dry. We learn from the dry part.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> Compared to blood, a Minchah is considered dry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If Kemitzah was done in the Heichal, it is Kosher, for we remove the Levonah from the Lechem ha'Panim in the Heichal, and this corresponds to Kemitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah - Beraisa):</span> "V'Kamatz mi'Sham" - from where the Zar stands (i.e. in the Azarah, not in the Heichal);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> What is the source that if Kemitzah was done with the left hand, he returns the Kometz, and does Kemitzah again, with the right hand?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Kamatz mi'Sham" - from the place where Kemitzah was already done.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah - some say, R. Yakov):</span> The verse does not exclude the Heichal. It comes to include the entire Azarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since Minchah is Kodshei Kodoshim like Olah, Kemitzah must be in the north, just like Shechitah and Kabalah of an Olah must be in the north.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Olah, for it is Kalil (totally burned on the Mizbe'ach)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would have thought to learn from Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Chatas, for it atones for Chayavei Kerisus!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would have thought to learn from Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Asham, for it has blood!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would have thought to learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah of Olah, Chatas and Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from them, for all of them have blood!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, since it says "v'Hegishah El ha'Mizbe'ach", and it says "v'Herim Mimenu b'Kumtzo" one might have thought that just like Hagashah is in the southwest corner, also Kemitzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"V'Kamatz mi'Sham" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If Shelamim was slaughtered in the Heichal, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "u'Shchato Pesach Ohel Mo'ed" - the Tefel should not be greater than the Ikar!</p></div>
