<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A SOURCE TO PERMIT A TREIFAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> A Tzad ha'Shavah would permit a Treifah (therefore, the verse is needed)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We could not learn from Melikah, for the Kedushah causes the Isur. Chelev and blood counter this (they are forbidden to people and may be offered, even though their Kedushah does not cause their Isur!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We could not learn from Chelev and blood, for the rest of what (the animal) they come from is permitted, whereas a Treifah is totally forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Melikah counters this. (It is Neveilah, which is totally forbidden to people.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The question against each of these does not apply to the other. The Tzad ha'Shavah of both is that forbidden to people and may be offered. We learn from this to Treifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah. In each of them, that is the Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Kal va'Chomer itself (forbidding a Treifah to be offered) is faulty!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We cannot learn from a Ba'al Mum, for this is a Pesul even in Kohanim (but Treifah is not)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha Sava):</span> Yotzei Dofen (one born through Caesarian section) refutes this. Such a Kohen is Kosher for Avodah, yet it is permitted to people and it may not be offered!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from Yotzei Dofen, for a firstborn Yotzei Dofen animal does not receive Kedushas Bechor, whereas a firstborn Treifah does!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ba'al Mum counters this (it receives Kedushas Bechor, it is permitted to people and it may not be offered)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from Ba'al Mum, for it is a Pesul in Kohanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The question against each of these does not apply to the other. The Tzad ha'Shavah is that both are permitted to people and may not be offered. Treifah is forbidden to people, all the more so it may not be offered! (So why is a verse needed?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We cannot learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah, for neither Ba'al Mum nor Yotzei Dofen is ever permitted (in Kodshim, where it is forbidden), but Treifah is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> In which case is Treifah permitted (but not Ba'al Mum or Yotzei Dofen)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Melikah of Olas ha'Of makes it a Treifah, yet it is Huktar.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Regarding birds, also a Ba'al Mum may be offered!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>It was taught that Zevachim must be unblemished and (sometimes) must be male, but regarding birds, we are never concerned (for minor blemishes or gender).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kohanim eat Melikas Chatas ha'Of, even though it is Treifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They eat from Hekdesh's table. (Regarding Hekdesh, also Ba'al Mum (of birds) is permitted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We cannot learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah, for the sources we learn from are known Pesulim. (Every Mum is visible, and people talk about a Yotzei Dofen, but some Treifos, e.g. a hole in the intestines, are not known to anyone, until after Shechitah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, a verse is needed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Other verses disqualify Treifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Mi'Mashke Yisrael" - Kodshim must be from things (that if they were Chulin would be) permitted to Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Kol Asher Ya'avor Tachas ha'Shavet" (regarding Ma'aser Behemah) excludes a Treifah, which does not pass (properly, for it is weak).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All three verses are needed:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it said only "mi'Mashke Yisrael", one might have thought to exclude only things that were never permitted, such as Orlah and Kilai ha'Kerem, but something that was permitted and became forbidden would be acceptable;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it said only "Kol Asher Ya'avor...", we would say that one cannot be Makdish a Treifah (to be Ma'aser or any other Korban), but if a Kosher Zevach became Treifah, it would be acceptable;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Therefore, it must also say "Min ha'Bakar."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PESULIM OF KEMITZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Each of the following disqualifies Minchas Chotei or any other Minchah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kemitzah was done by a Zar, Onen, Tevul Yom, Mechushar Begadim, Mechushar Kipurim, one who did not wash his hands and feet, Arel, or Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It was done while sitting, or standing on top of a Kli, Behemah or another Kohen's foot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If Kemitzah was done with the left hand, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Ben Beseira says, he returns the Kometz to the Minchah, and does Kemitzah again, with his right hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If the Kometz included a pebble, grain of salt, or grain of Levonah (frankincense), it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because a Kometz that is too big or Chaser (lacking) is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>A Kometz is too big if some of the Minchah sticks out (to the right or left of the three (middle) fingers (that he bends them back to his palm), or it some is between the end of one of these fingers and the palm);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>A Kometz is Chaser if (it included a pebble, or grain, like above, or if) the fingers were curled, and not extended.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Mishnah could have said 'any Minchah.' Why did it specify Minchas Chotei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a Chidush according to R. Shimon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> It would have been proper that Minchas Chotei require oil and Levonah, in order that a sinner will not 'profit' (pay less than one who brings a normal Minchah);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Torah exempted it, in order that his Korban not be beautiful.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It would have been proper that a Chatas require Nesachim, in order that a sinner not 'profit';</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Torah exempted it, in order that his Korban will not be beautiful.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One might have thought that since R. Shimon holds that the Torah does not want a sinner's Korban to be beautiful, if a Pasul did Kemitzah, it should be Kosher. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the corresponding Mishnah about Zevachim should also teach this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It should disqualify Kabalah of Chatas Chelev (or any other Chatas brought for a transgression) or any other Chatas (e.g. Yoledes or of the Tzibur) done by a Zar or Onen...;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This would be a Chidush according to R. Shimon (even though the Korban should not be beautiful, we do not Machshir Avodah of a Pasul!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>That Mishnah does not specify Chatas Chelev. It just says 'any Chatas.' Apparently, saying 'any' without saying 'except for' teaches all cases;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Also here, since it says 'any' and does not list exceptions, this 'except for' teaches all cases;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here, the Mishnah must teach that R. Shimon admits:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since the Reisha (the first Mishnah) is unlike R. Shimon (according to Rabah and Rava; Shitah Mekubetzes (32) - according to everyone, for it disqualifies Holachah Lo Lishmah), one might have thought that also the Seifa is unlike R. Shimon. Therefore, it teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CAN A KEMITZAH PESULAH BE FIXED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a Zar did Kemitzah, he returns it (to the Minchah. The Minchah is Kosher, a Kohen will do Kemitzah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah said that a Zar is Posel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that it is Pasul until it is returned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah ben Beseira says this. (Surely, the first Tana argues!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> All agree when the Kometz is intact that he returns it. They argue only when it is Chaser;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim say that he may not bring more from his house to complete the lack. R. Yehudah says that he may.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Mishnah - R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> He returns the Kometz and does Kemitzah again...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If all agree to this, and the argument is whether or not he may bring more from his house, R. Yehudah should say, he returns it, brings more from his house and does Kemitzah again...!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav's law is like R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yehudah explicitly says that he returns it! (What is Rav's Chidush?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah only said this regarding Kemitzas Smol (taken with the left hand);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that other Pesulim cannot be fixed. Rav teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would we think that the left hand different, i.e. it is the only Pesul that can be fixed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Smol is used in the Avodah on Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Also a Zar is Kosher for Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shechitah is not an Avodah. (Rashi - because a Zar may do it; Tosfos Zevachim 14b - because the Shochet need not be in the Azarah, or because even Chulin requires Shechitah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is an Avodah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira citing Rav):</span> If a Zar slaughtered the Parah Adumah, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> (We know this because) it says "Elazar" (i.e. a Kohen) and "Chukah" (which teaches that it is Me'akev.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Parah Adumah is different. It is Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis. (Avodah does not apply to them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Shechitah of Bedek ha'Bayis requires a Kohen, all the more so Shechitah of Kodshei Mizbe'ach! (Rashba - the questioner misunderstood the previous answer to mean that Shechitah of Bedek ha'Bayis is an Avodah that requires Kehunah, but we do not find this regarding Kodshei Mizbe'ach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> Shechitah of Bedek ha'Bayis requires a Kohen just like seeing Tzara'as (to rule on it), even though neither is an Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> We should learn from a Bamah (that a Zar is sometimes Kosher for Avodah, so surely Kemitzas Zar can be fixed, just like Kemitzas Smol!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We do not learn from (the fact that something is Kosher on) a Bamah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that if Yotzei (Eimurim that left the Azarah) came up on the Mizbe'ach, we do not take it down?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because Yotzei is Kosher on a Bamah, it is not taken down from the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, we do not learn from a Bamah. The Tana really learns from "Zos Toras ha'Olah" that they are not taken down.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHEN CAN THE PESUL BE FIXED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Rav had to teach that R. Yehudah says that other Pesulim can be fixed, otherwise, we would have thought that they cannot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah and R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> R. Yehudah ben Beseira says that all Pesulim can be fixed. (Tosfos - everyone already knew this Beraisa or the next, therefore, Rav did not need to teach this.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Beraisa):</span> "V'Kamatz mi'Sham" - from where the Zar stands (Rashi - Ezras Yisrael, i.e. Tzafon is not required; Tosfos - it need not be where Hagashah is done (the southwest corner of the Mizbe'ach));</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> What is the source that if Kemitzah was done with the left hand, he returns the Kometz, and does Kemitzah again, with the right hand?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Kamatz mi'Sham" - from the place where Kemitzah was already done.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The verse does not specify why Kemitzah was repeated. Surely the same law applies to all Pesulim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> Rav's Chidush is that R. Yehudah ben Beseira allows fixing the Pesul even after the Kometz was put in a Kli Shares. Tana'im argue about this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ben Yosi and R. Yehudah ha'Nachtom):</span> (R.
