<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE BREAK BETWEEN THE PARSHIYOS IN A MEZUZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> R. Meir would write Mezuzos on Duchsustus. (Hide has two layers that can be peeled apart. The inner layer, i.e. closer to the flesh, is called Duchsustus. Rashi (elsewhere) and Tosfos explain like this. This is why Shitah Mekubetzes corrects the text of Rashi.) The shape of the writing was (long and thin), like a column;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He left a space above and below, and made the Parshiyos open.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Elazar:</span> Why did you make them open? (They are closed in the Torah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> I made them open because they are not adjacent in the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chananel citing Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question - suggestion:</span> The Halachah follows him (even) regarding open Parshiyos. (Rav Huna was a Talmid of Rav. Surely, he conducted like Rav!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, Rav ruled like R. Shimon ben Elazar (only) regarding the spaces above and below.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much space must be left?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Menasiya bar Yakov):</span> He must leave the size of the clamp (to hold down the corners of the parchment).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye (to Rav Yosef):</span> Don't you agree that Rav did not rule like R. Shimon regarding open Parshiyos?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav says that the custom prevails, and the custom is to make the Parshiyos closed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah citing Rav):</span> If Eliyahu will come and tell us that we may use a Min'al (a soft shoe) for Chalitzah, we will heed him. If he will tell us that we may not use a Sandal (a hard shoe), we will not heed him, for the custom is to use a Sandal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef citing Rav):</span> If Eliyahu will tell us that we may not use a Min'al, we will heed him. If he will tell us that we may not use a Sandal (a hard shoe), we will not heed him, for the custom is to use a Sandal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these versions?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yosef permits using a Min'al l'Chatchilah. Rabah holds that it may not be used l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> (According to both versions, Eliyahu cannot abolish the custom to use a Sandal.) This proves that Rav holds that that the custom prevails.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> L'Chatchilah, the Parshiyos should be made closed. R. Shimon ben Elazar teaches that even open Parshiyos are Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If (parchments of) a Sefer Torah or Tefilin became worn, they may not be used for a Mezuzah, for we do not demote something to a lower Kedushah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it were permitted to demote to a lower Kedushah, they could be used for a Mezuzah, even though the (first) Parshah (in a Mezuzah, Shma Yisrael) is closed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (No. Even if it was permitted to demote Kedushah, we could not use both Parshiyos from the Torah, for Shma is closed in the Torah.) 	Because we do not demote to a lower Kedushah, even one Parshah may not be used (even if he would attach it to the other Parshah, making an open break between them - Rashba). Alternatively, the question assumed that the Beraisa would permit using an entire Parshah (if not for demoting the Kedushah), even though each of them is closed. The rejection says that perhaps the Beraisa discusses using one line of a Parshah.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>USING PARCHMENTS OF A SEFER TORAH OR TEFILIN FOR A MEZUZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May we really infer that if it was permitted to demote Kedushah, they could be used for a Mezuzah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> A tradition from Moshe from Sinai teaches that Tefilin are written on Klaf (the outer layer of hide), and Mezuzos are written on Duchsustus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>On Klaf, we write on the inner side (that faced the flesh). On Duchsustus, we write on the outer side (that faced the hair).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is l'Chatchilah. (B'Di'eved, a Mezuzah on Klaf is Kosher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #2):</span> If one deviated, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers only to writing Tefilin on Duchsustus. (A Mezuzah on Klaf is Kosher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #3):</span> If one deviated in either of these, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This refers to writing Tefilin on the wrong side of either parchment, i.e. on the outer side of Klaf or on the inner side of Duchsustus. (One may not use either side of Duchsustus. Beraisa #2 disqualified the outer side. One might have thought that Tefilin are Kosher on the inner side, like we find regarding Klaf.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Tana'im argue about writing Tefilin or Mezuzos on the wrong kind of parchment. (Beraisa #1 is like R. Acha.);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one deviated (wrote on the wrong kind of parchment) in either of these (Tefilin or Mezuzos), it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Acha is Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May we really infer that if it was permitted to demote Kedushah, parchments of a Sefer Torah or Tefilin could be used for a Mezuzah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mezuzah requires Sirtut (lines scratched in the parchment to help the scribe write straight. Tefilin (Tosfos - and Sifrei Torah) do not require Sirtut, therefore, normally, they do not have Sirtut!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Minyomi bar Chilkiyah citing Rav):</span> A Mezuzah without Sirtut is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Minyamin):</span> A tradition from Sinai requires Sirtut in a Mezuzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about whether a Mezuzah requires Sirtut.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yirmeyah):</span> Tefilin and Mezuzos may be written by memory (without written parchments in front of him). They do not require Sirtut.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>The Halachah is, Tefilin does not require Sirtut, but Mezuzah does. Both may be written by memory.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SITTING ON A BED ON WHICH A SEFER TORAH RESTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chelbo):</span> I once saw that Rav Huna wanted to sit on a bed on which a Sefer Torah was resting. He stood up a barrel and put the Sefer Torah on it, and then sat on the bed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that one may not sit on a bed on which a Sefer Torah rests. He argues with Rabah bar bar Chanah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> One may sit on a bed on which a Sefer Torah rests;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A case occurred in which R. Elazar realized that he was sitting on a bed on which a Sefer Torah rests. He sat on the floor and was grieved like one bitten by a snake!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is wrong. Really, he realized that the Sefer Torah was on the floor!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Sefer Torah was written like an Igeres (letter, i.e. he was not precise about extra or missing letters; Rashi - alternatively, it was without Sirtut), it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn a Gezerah Shavah "Kesivah-Kesivah" from Sefer (Torah; alternatively, from Sefer Kerisus (Get); Tosfos - from Megilas Sotah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHERE TO PUT THE MEZUZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one hung a Mezuzah from a stick, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be 'bi'Sh'arecha' (on your gates).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one hung a Mezuzah from a stick or affixed it in back of the door, this is dangerous (Tosfos - one might bang his head on it; Rashi - he is not guarded from Mazikim, because) he does not fulfill the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The household of Melech Munvaz would take Mezuzos with them when they traveled. They would hang a Mezuzah in the doorway of the inn (even though they were exempt), to commemorate the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mezuzah should be affixed in the width of the entrance.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. It says "uvi'Sh'arecha"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava taught that the Mezuzah should be affixed in the Tefach closest to Reshus ha'Rabim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that the further from the house the better, so it should be entirely outside the entranceway. Rav Yehudah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
