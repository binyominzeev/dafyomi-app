<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THINGS THAT NEED NOT BE SALTED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Initially, we said that 'Minchah' excludes wood and blood. Now we deleted 'wood' from the Beraisa,) what does 'Minchah' exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We cannot say that it excludes only blood. "Me'Al Minchasecha" excludes blood!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes Nesachim. The Beraisa should say 'Nesachim' in place of 'wood'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Wine, blood, wood and Ketores need not be salted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot be Rebbi. He requires salting wood!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It cannot be Chachamim. They require salting Ketores!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the following Tana:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yochanan ben Brokah):</span> The Prat (Minchah) is Mekabel Tum'ah and it is burned on the fire of the outer Mizbe'ach. All such things are salted;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This excludes wood, which is not Mekabel Tum'ah, and blood and wine, which do not go on the fire, and Ketores, which is burned on the inner Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SALTED, COOKED AND CONGEALED BLOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A verse is needed to exclude blood. If not, we would say that it must be salted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Salted blood is not considered blood! (Salting is like cooking.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> One is not liable for eating cooked blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Ze'iri):</span> One is not liable for eating salted blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If limbs were roasted before they were offered, he did not fulfill "Re'ach Nicho'ach." (They will not give off a nice smell when burned on the Mizbe'ach.).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that only a small amount of salt is put on. (This is not like cooking.) The verse teaches that it is not salted at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> One is not liable for eating cooked blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye of Rava - Mishnah):</span> If one cooked blood until it hardened and ate it, or melted Chelev and drank it, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is not liable for eating blood (Chulin or Kodesh) that congealed through cooking on a fire, for it cannot revert to blood (Rashi - through adding water; Shitah - this means that such blood is no longer Kosher for Zerikah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One is liable for eating blood that congealed in the sun, for it can revert to blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The following dialogue shows that also blood that congealed in the sun is Nidcheh (loses the status of blood, and is Pasul for Zerikah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mari):</span> If one ate congealed blood, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Once it congealed, it is Nidcheh (therefore, he is exempt).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Rava was silent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (Abaye):</span> Perhaps one is liable for congealed blood of outer Chata'os (the reason will be explained), but he is exempt for that of inner Chata'os!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> You reminded me of Rav Chisda's teaching;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If blood of an outer Chatas congealed, one who eats it is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It says "v'Lakach... v'Nasan" (Vayikra 4:30). Since congealed blood can be taken and put (on the Keren), it is still considered blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If blood of an inner Chatas congealed, one who eats it is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It says "v'Toval... v'Hizah" - since one cannot immerse (a finger) in or sprinkle congealed blood, it is not considered blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava himself):</span> One is liable even for congealed blood of an inner Chatas, since such blood of outer Chata'os is considered blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Papa):</span> One is liable for congealed blood of a donkey, since such blood of outer Chata'os is considered blood (had we not learned from outer Chata'os, we would have thought that one is exempt for (Shitah - congealed; Rashi - even liquid) blood of a donkey.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal citing Ze'iri):</span> Blood is a Chatzitzah, whether it is wet or dry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The following are a Chatzitzah if they are dry, but not if they are wet: blood, ink, honey, and milk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are a Chatzitzah only from when they are Sarich (started to dry), but not before this.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF SALT USED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Timlach"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "ba'Melach" teaches that Tevonehu (this will be explained)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Timlach."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one may put on brine!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "ba'Melach".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"V'Lo Sashbis Melach" - bring salt that does not cease, i.e. Sedom salt. (The sea constantly deposits it in winter and summer (Rashi), and even on Shabbos (Aruch).)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to bring man-made salt if Sedom salt is not available?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Takriv" - offer any kind of salt, from anywhere (even Chutz la'Aretz), even on Shabbos, even when offering b'Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'Tevonehu' mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar Ula):</span> Yisbonenu (put a great amount), like Teven (straw) in mud.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> If so, the Beraisa should have said Yisbonenu!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> One must make like a Binyan (building of salt.).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, it should have said "Yivnenu"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> One must Yevonenu (Shitah Mekubetzes; Ya'avetz - Tevinehu.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - our text - Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> One might have thought that any amount enough to give Ta'am (taste) suffices, just like a bit of understanding gives Ta'am (sound reason) to people. "Timlach" teaches that this is not so;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Rather, one puts (much) salt on each side of the limb and offers it.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The same is required for salting meat to be cooked in a pot. (We must extract all the blood.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Gershom - Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> One might have thought that one must put in much salt, to give Ta'am, just like (much) understanding gives Ta'am to people. "Timlach" teaches that this is not so;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><p>Rather, one puts (a little) salt on each side of the limb and offers it.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The same suffices for salting meat to be roasted. (In any case roasting extracts the blood.)</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE KEDUSHAH OF THE SALT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Me'ilah applies to salt on limbs, but not to salt (ready to be put on Korbanos, stored) on the ramp and the top of the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Masnah):</span> The Tana learns from "v'Hishilchu ha'Kohanim Aleihem Melach v'He'elu Osam Olah." (Also the salt on the limbs is called 'Olah'.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Din (of Kohanim) stipulated about the Kedushah of seven things:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kohanim may benefit from wood and salt (of Hekdesh)...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They may use salt for their Korbanos, but not for their eating.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>We are thinking that this refers to salting their Korbanos and eating Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is unreasonable that Hekdesh salt may be used to salt hides of Korbanos (that become Chulin and Kohanim receive them) but not to eat Korbanos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Salt was stored in three places: in the salt chamber, on the ramp, and on top of the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Hides of Korbanos were salted in (Rambam; Tosfos - using salt of) the salt chamber. Limbs were salted on the ramp;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The following were salted on top of the Mizbe'ach (with Hekdesh salt) -- Kometz, Levonah, Ketores, Minchas Kohanim, Minchas Chavitim, and Olas ha'Of.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Shmuel refers to eating the Korbanos, and eating Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, they may not eat Chulin with salt of the Mikdash. One may not (Rashi; Shitah Mekubetzes - it is not normal to) eat Chulin b'Azarah, even without salt!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yochlu" teaches that (when there is little Kodshim,) we eat Chulin and Terumah with Kodshim, in order that Kodshim will be eaten when the person is already satiated;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even so, they may not eat Chulin with Hekdesh salt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Answer #1 - Ravina):</span> Surely, Shmuel did not refer to salting their Korbanos, for this would not require a stipulation of Beis Din!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Korbanos of Yisraelim are salted with Hekdesh salt. Kohanim should be no worse!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a Yisrael who vowed to bring a Minchah must bring his own salt, just like he must bring his own Levonah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is logical. The Torah commands to put salt on a Minchah, and to put Levonah on a Minchah. Just like he must bring his own Levonah, we should say that he must bring his own salt!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-suggestion:</span> Perhaps we should learn from wood instead!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Torah requires wood for a Minchah, and also salt. Just like the Tzibur supplies the wood, it should supply also the salt!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Decision:</span> It is more reasonable to learn from wood, which applies to all Korbanos, and not from Levonah, which applies only to Menachos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should rather learn from Levonah, for it is brought in the same Kli as the Minchah, and not from wood, which is not brought in the same Kli!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> It says "Bris Melach Olam" (R. Tam - "Melach Bris"), and (regarding Lechem ha'Panim) "me'Es Bnei Yisrael Bris Olam";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like the Tzibur supplies Lechem ha'Panim, it supplies salt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Mordechai):</span> Indeed, Shmuel refers to salting their Korbanos and eating Kodshim. The Mishnah is like Ben Buchri;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah citing Ben Buchri):</span> If a Kohen is Shokel (gives a half-Shekel along with Bnei Yisrael, to buy Korbanos Tzibur), he does not transgress;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> Rather, a Kohen who does not Shokel transgresses!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Kohanim (incorrectly) expound the following, to their (monetary) advantage.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"V'Chol Minchas Kohen Kalil Tihyeh Lo Se'achel." If Kohanim would be Shokel, they would be (joint) owners of (all Korbanos Tzibur, including) the Omer, Lechem ha'Panim and Shtei ha'Lechem, they could not be eaten!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Ben Buchri, a Kohen who is Shokel transgresses, for the Tzibur will (improperly) buy Korbanos using his half-Shekel. They are Chulin b'Azarah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kohen gives his half-Shekel to the Tzibur, and then it is given to Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Culmination of Answer #2:</span> One might have thought that the Hekdesh salt is only for Korbanos of Yisrael, for they pay for the salt. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
