<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHICH KORBANOS ARE ME'AKEV EACH OTHER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It discusses Musafim of Rosh Chodesh, and those of Shavu'os written in Bamidbar (in Parshas Pinchus).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which rams does the Mishnah discuss?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be of Rosh Chodesh, and those of Shavu'os in Bamidbar, for only one ram is offered then!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It cannot be those of Shavu'os written in Vayikra (brought with Shtei ha'Lechem, in Parshas Emor), for it says 'Havayah' regarding them! (They are Me'akev each other.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that the (two) rams of Shavu'os in Vayikra are not Me'akev the ram of Shavu'os in Bamidbar, nor vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to this, the Tana taught together totally opposite laws!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Bulls of Rosh Chodesh, or of Shavu'os in Bamidbar are not Me'akev each other (even the ones in the same Parshah, and all the more so those in the other Parshah. The same applies to lambs);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The rams (of Shavu'os) in Vayikra are not Me'akev those in Bamidbar, nor vice-versa. However, those in Vayikra are Me'akev each other!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Tana taught them together, even though they have different laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "uv'Yom ha'Chodesh Par Ben Bakar Temimim v'Sheshes Kevasim va'Ayil Temimim Yihyu" (i.e. a bull? Two bulls are brought on Rosh Chodesh!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that if we cannot bring two bulls, we bring one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it mention six lambs? (We offer seven on Rosh Chodesh!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that if we cannot bring seven, we bring six.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that if we cannot bring six, we bring five, and if we cannot bring five, we bring four... three, two or one?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "vela'Kevasim Ka'asher Tasig Yado".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This verse teaches to bring as many as possible. What do we learn from the six lambs in the previous verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that we should make great efforts to bring as many as possible.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that all the animals of one type are Me'akev each other? (Rashi - this is if we have them all. Shitah Mekubetzes - we bring as many Zevachim as we can, even if this will not leave money for their Nesachim; this is unlike R. Shimon.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Yihyu".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DIFFICULT VERSES IN YECHEZKEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "...ba'Rishon b'Echad la'Chodesh Tikach Par Ben Bakar Tamim v'Chitesa Es ha'Makdish"? 'Chitesa' is from the word Chatas, but the bull of Rosh Chodesh is an Olah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Until Eliyahu comes, no one will be able to explain this verse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The verse discusses Milu'im (inaugural Korbanos) offered in the days of Ezra, like those of Chanukas ha'Mishkan (Rashi. R. Gershom - it discusses Milu'im that will be offered in the third Mikdash, just like in the days of Ezra they offered Milu'im resembling those of the Mishkan.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The verse must teach that they are forbidden to Kohanim;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Chodesh" refers to a Chidush, i.e. they (mistakenly) changed the Halachah and permitted Chelev (or another Chiyuv Kares);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Me'Ish Shogeh umi'Pesi" - the Korban is brought only if the Hora'ah was mistaken and the people sinned b'Shogeg.</p></div>

(Tosfos, citing Rashi - we did not ask that both of these are less than an Eifah (10 Esronim). Perhaps two or three Esronim are extracted from (sifting) an Eifah. R.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon):</span> Rather, this teaches that if Hekdesh has (money for) many bulls but not for all the Nesachim, they bring one bull and its Nesech. They do not bring the bulls without Nesachim;</p></div>
