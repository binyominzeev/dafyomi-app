<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>STRINGENCIES OF SEMICHAH AND TENUFAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In some ways Semichah is more stringent than Tenufah, in other ways Tenufah is more stringent:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Semichah is more stringent regarding partners. One partner in a Korban can do Tenufah for all of the partners, but everyone must do Semichah himself;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A stringency of Tenufah is that it applies to Korbanos Yachid and Korbanos Tzibur, alive and slaughtered, to animals and inanimate things (Lachmei Todah and Nesachim), but Semichah does not. (Although Semichah applies to two Korbanos Tzibur, this is only while they are alive. Alternatively, Semichah does not apply to (all) Korbanos Tzibur that correspond to Korbanos Yachid that require Semichah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Korbano" teaches that every partner on a Korban must Somech. A Kal va'Chomer would have taught otherwise:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tenufah applies to slaughtered animals, but all partners on a Korban do not wave. Semichah does not apply to slaughtered animals, all the more so all partners should not be Somech!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Korbano" teaches that every partner is Somech.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that all partners on a Korban wave!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Semichah does not apply to slaughtered animals, yet all partners are Somech. Tenufah applies to slaughtered animals, all the more so all partners should wave!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is impossible for all partners to wave:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If (there are many partners and) all will wave at the same time, not everyone can touch the Korban, for other people's hands are in the way. This is a Chatzitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They may not wave at different times, for the Torah obligates Tenufah (singular), i.e. only once!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Semichah does apply to slaughtered animals!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Kohen Gadol wants to offer (the Tamid), he ascends the ramp with the Segan on his right side. When they are half-way up, the Segan helps him up the rest of the way;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The first (of the 11 Kohanim selected in the lottery to offer the Tamid) hands the head and hind leg to the Kohen Gadol. He is Somech on them and throws them onto the fire;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The second (of the 11) hands the forelegs to the first. He hands it to the Kohen Gadol, who is Somech on them and throws them onto the fire;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The second goes away. All the others do likewise. The Kohen Gadol is Somech and throws the limbs;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the Kohen Gadol wants, he does Semichah and others do Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> That is not real Semichah. It is merely for the honor of the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MAKING THE LOAVES INDIVIDUALLY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The two loaves of Shtei ha'Lechem are kneaded and baked individually;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The (12) loaves of Lechem ha'Panim are kneaded individually and baked two at a time;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>There was a mold for them. When they were removed from the oven, they were put into the mold, so they would not break.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Shnei Esronim Yihyeh ha'Chalah ha'Echas" teaches that (loaves of Lechem ha'Panim) are kneaded individually;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Shtei ha'Lechem?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yihyeh" (is extra to teach this).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Lechem ha'Panim are baked two at a time?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "v'Samta Osam."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the same applies to Shtei ha'Lechem!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Osam" (teaches only Lechem ha'Panim, but not Shtei ha'Lechem.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already used this to teach about baking Lechem ha'Panim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said "v'Samtam". Rather, it says "v'Samta Osam", therefore we learn both of these.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Samta Osam" teaches that we put them in a mold;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>There are three molds. The dough is placed into one. It is baked in a second mold in the oven. When they were removed from the oven, they were put into a third mold, so they would not break.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we return the bread (from the oven) into the first mold?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It became bigger. It would not fit into the first mold again.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SHAPE OF LECHEM HA'PANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the shape of Lechem ha'Panim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chanina):</span> Each loaf was like an open box (missing a top and two opposite walls);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> Each loaf was like a Rokedes ship (wide on top and narrow below. Rashi - it was shaped like a 'V'. Tosfos - each end was vertical, the middle was (slightly) inclined, like a ship, like the top of the second picture in Tosfos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Chanina, it is flat. We understand how the Bazichei Levonah rested on it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, according to R. Yochanan, they would not rest nicely!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (He says that) there was a place in (each) top loaf hollowed out to hold the Bazichim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>(On top of each loaf (except for the top loaf) were three (or two) poles to separate it from the loaf above.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Chanina, we understand how the poles rested on the loaves;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, according to R. Yochanan, only one pole would rest (in the ridge)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The loaves were shaped with small ridges to hold the poles in place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Chanina, we understand how the Snifin (upright supports) support the bread (Rashi - it rested on ledges coming out of the Snifim; Tosfos - the Snifin held the bottom loaf in place);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>according to R. Yochanan, how do the Snifin support the (R. Gershom - folds of the) bread?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Snifin were shaped like semi-circles. The bread rested on top of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, we understand the need for Snifin. (The loaves cannot balance by themselves);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, according to R. Chanina, why are Snifin needed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They support the weight of the bread. If not, the bottom loaves would break from the weight of the top ones.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, we understand how Snifin rested on the Shulchan (under the slope of the breads);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, according to R. Chanina, the breads are flush on the Shulchan. There is no place for the Snifin! Will we say that the Snifin rest on the ground?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> According to R. Yochanan, the Snifin rest on the Shulchan. According to R. Chanina, the Snifin rest on the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like which Amora is the following teaching?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The bread supports the Snifin, and the Snifin support the bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Yochanan.</p></div>
