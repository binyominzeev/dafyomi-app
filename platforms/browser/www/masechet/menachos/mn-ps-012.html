<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>INTENTIONS THAT DISQUALIFY MENACHOS (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> The general rule about (the four Avodos, i.e.) Kemitzah, Nesinah (putting the Kometz) in another Kli, Holachah or Haktarah, done with intent to eat something that is normally eaten, or to be Maktir something that is normally Huktar:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he intended Chutz li'Mkomo, the Minchah is Pasul, but there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he intended Chutz li'Zmano, it is Pigul, and there is Kares, if the Matir (the Kometz, which permits the Shirayim) was offered properly (except for intention of Chutz li'Zmano).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When do we say that the Matir was offered properly?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Some (or all) of the four Avodos were done (with intent) Chutz li'Zmano and the others were proper.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When do we say that the Matir was not offered properly?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Some (or all) of the Avodos were done (with intent) Chutz li'Mkomo and the others were Chutz li'Zmano;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Alternatively, in Minchas Chotei or Minchas Kena'os, some Avodos were Lo Lishmah (which is Posel these Menachos), the others were Chutz li'Zmano.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>In the following cases the Minchah is Pasul, and there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He intended (during one Avodah) to eat a k'Zayis outside (Chutz li'Mkomo) and a k'Zayis tomorrow (Chutz li'Zmano), or a k'Zayis tomorrow and a k'Zayis outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He intended for half a k'Zayis tomorrow and half a k'Zayis outside, or half a k'Zayis outside and half a k'Zayis tomorrow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, the rule is, if (the intent) Chutz li'Zmano came before Chutz li'Mkomo, it is Pigul, and there is Kares. if Chutz li'Mkomo came before Chutz li'Zmano, it is not Pigul, and there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Chachamim say, In both cases it is Pasul, and there is no Kares.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HAKTARAH THAT DOES NOT PERMIT THE SHIRAYIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (R. Yochanan holds that) if a Minchah became Chaser between Kemitzah and Haktarah, we are Maktir the Kometz, but the Shirayim may not be eaten:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Does this Haktarah (make it considered as if the Matir was offered properly to) make Pigul (if the only Pasul intentions were Chutz li'Zmano), and uproot Me'ilah from the Shirayim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> Even R. Akiva, who says that Zerikah uproots Me'ilah from Yotzei (Kodshim that left the Azarah), says so only about Yotzei, for it is intact, and an external cause is Posel it. He would agree that Zerikah does not help Chaser.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection and Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Just the contrary! Even R. Eliezer, who says that Zerikah does not uproot Me'ilah from Yotzei, says so only about Yotzei, for it is outside. He would agree that Zerikah helps Chaser, for it is in the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rava, for himself - Mishnah):</span> If Kemitzah was done with intent to eat the Shirayim or a k'Zayis of the Shirayim outside...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya's Beraisa):</span> If Kemitzah was done with intent to eat the Shirayim outside...(the Beraisa teaches all the cases of the Mishnah, but it omits 'or a k'Zayis').</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Beraisa omit 'or a k'Zayis of the Shirayim'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah discusses when the Shirayim became Chaserim, and only a k'Zayis remains;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since the case cannot be taught regarding Nesinah b'Kli, Holachah or Haktarah (Chisaron after Kemitzah is Posel, so it cannot become Pigul), the Beraisa did not teach it even regarding Kemitzah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The Seifa says that there is Kares. This shows that it is called Haktarah to make Pigul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> No, the Beraisa is like R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a k'Zayis of any of the following was offered outside, he is liable:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A Kometz, Levonah, Ketores, the Minchah of a Kohen, Minchas Chavitim, or Minchas Nesachim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer exempts, unless he offered all of it.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Tana of the Beraisa could not teach Haktarah of 'a k'Zayis of a Kometz' (since he holds like R. Eliezer, that partial Haktarah is not considered Haktarah), so he did not teach this regarding any of the Avodos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>(R. Chiya's Beraisa was just like the Mishnah, which said that intent 'Lehaktir its Kometz' causes Pigul.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Beraisa is like R. Eliezer, there is no Pigul unless he intended Lehaktir all the Matitrim, its Kometz and Levonah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If someone offered Kometz or Levonah outside, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer exempts, unless he offered both of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses Minchas Chotei (which has no Levonah, therefore Haktaras ha'Kometz alone makes Pigul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did the Tana teach this entire Beraisa only regarding Minchas Chotei?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! Rav Dimi explained that the Beraisa discusses Minchas Chotei. It is like R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> I was wrong. A Beraisa disproves me.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Kodesh Kodoshim Hu" - if one of the Chalos (Rashi - of Lechem ha'Panim; Rambam - of Lachmei Todah) became Chaser, they are all invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> In the case of Yotzei (all was intact, but part left the Azarah), the Chalos remaining inside would be Kesherim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is like R. Akiva, who holds that Zerikah takes effect on Yotzei, but it does not take effect on Chaser!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa does not disprove you;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It does not say that if part was Yotzei, the Chalos remaining inside would be Kesherim. Rather, we infer that if some became Tamei, the Tahor Chalos would be Kesherim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are the Tehorim Kesherim?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tzitz is Meratzeh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Indeed, if part was Yotzei, all the Chalos are Pesulim. This is like R. Eliezer, who says that Zerikah does not help for Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Really, the Beraisa should have taught also Yotzei. It taught Chaser, for this is a bigger Chidush. Even though the Chalos are in the Azarah, Haktarah does not permit them.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>According to R. Akiva, who says that Zerikah helps for Yotzei, Haktarah would permit (the remaining Chalos when some were) Chaser.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>JOINING HALF-SHIURIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he intended to eat half a k'Zayis (of Shirayim, Chutz li'Mkomo or Chutz li'Zmano) and be Maktir half a k'Zayis (of Kometz or Levonah, Chutz...), it is Kosher, because eating and burning do not join.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> In a similar case of eating (Shirayim) and eating (Kometz or Levonah), they would join, even though it is not normal to eat the latter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (the previous Mishnah):</span> ...Intent to eat something normally eaten (makes Pigul).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Things not normally eaten do not make (or join for) Pigul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of our Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Our Mishnah is R. Eliezer, who says that intent for a person to eat something proper for the Mizbe'ach, or vice-versa (to be Maktir something proper for people), is intent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Kemitzah was done with intent to eat (Chutz li'Zmano or Chutz li'Mkomo) something which is not normally eaten, or be Maktir something not normally Huktar, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Our Mishnah can be like Chachamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do not infer that intent to eat something not normally eaten joins for Pigul. Rather, two intents to eat join if both are for something normally eaten.</p></div>
