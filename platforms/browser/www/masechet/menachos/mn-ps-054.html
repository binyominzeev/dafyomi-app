<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>USING APPLES TO FERMENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not use (R. Gershom - juice of) apples to ferment (Shtei ha'Lechem or Lachmei Todah);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Chanina ben Gamliel (according to Rav Kahana - R. Chanina ben Tradyon) permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Terumah apple was minced and put into a dough and fermented it, it is forbidden (to Zarim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is like R. Chanina.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and rejection of suggestion):</span> It is even like Chachamim. Granted, it does not become proper Chametz, but it does become Chametz Nuksheh (lowly Chametz; R. Gershom - a hardened dough, it is neither Matzah nor Chametz; Aruch - Chametz that fermented without Se'or).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ila):</span> The hardest Kemitzah is of Minchas Chotei. (It is pure flour. When wiping away the excess sticking out (of the three middle fingers), extra flour is prone to fall out.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> (It is not hard.) Minchas Chotei may be kneaded with water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Ila is concerned for the original volume. (If we would add water, the Kometz would lack (or have an excess of) the difference in volume of the dough taken and its flour), R. Yitzchak follows the current volume (exactly a Kometz is taken, we are not concerned that it includes water.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all follow the current volume;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Minchas Chotei is called Chareivah (dry). R. Ila explains that it may not have any liquid at all. R. Yitzchak explains that it has no oil (unlike regular Menachos), but it may have water.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>INCREASE AND DECREASE OF VOLUME</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If calf meat swelled or if meat of an old animal shriveled, we judge them l'Kemos she'Hen (according to their volume).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav (and R. Chiya...)):</span> The text is Kemos she'Hen (according to their current volume).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel (and R. Shimon bar Rebbi...)):</span> The text is l'Kemos she'Hen (based on the original volume).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> If calf meat was less than (k'Beitzah, i.e. the volume of an egg) the Shi'ur for Tum'ah, and it swelled to the Shi'ur, it is retroactively Tahor (i.e. regarding Tum'os before it swelled) and Tamei for the future. (Some explain that the Shi'ur is to receive Tum'ah mid'Oraisa. Some explain that the Shi'ur is to become Huchshar, i.e. if it becomes wet, it can receive Tum'ah. Some explain that it is to be Metamei other food.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mid'Rabanan it is Tamei for the future. (Mid'Oraisa, it is Tahor.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> The same applies to Pigul and Nosar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If mid'Oraisa we follow the current volume (for the future), this teaches that one is Chayav Kares for eating a k'Zayis of swelled Pigul or Nosar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>if we follow the current volume mid'Rabanan, we cannot say that Chachamim are Mechayev Kares for (swelled) Pigul or Nosar!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, the same applies to Tum'ah of Pigul and Nosar:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since Tum'as Pigul and Nosar is only mid'Rabanan, they did not apply another mid'Rabanan stringency (to follow the current volume) to it. The Beraisa teaches that they apply the stringency.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> If meat of an old animal was a Shi'ur, and shriveled to less than a Shi'ur, it is retroactively Tamei, and Tahor for the future.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer: (Rabah):</span> (The argument of the Amora'im is not as we assumed.) All agree that if at first there was a Shi'ur and now there is not, (for the future) we follow the present;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All agree that if at first there was not a Shi'ur and now there is, we follow the present mid'Rabanan;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">54b----------------------------------------54b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They argue when there was a Shi'ur, it shriveled to less than a Shi'ur, and then returned to its original size;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Shmuel holds that Dichuy applies to Isurim (and Tum'os. Since one was not liable for it when it was shriveled, one will never be liable for it again);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Rav holds that Dichuy does not apply to Isurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does anyone really hold that Dichuy applies to Isurim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If k'Beitzah of food, a k'Zayis of Tum'as Mes or Neveilah, or the volume of a lentil of a Sheretz was left in the sun, and it shriveled to less than a Shi'ur, it loses its Tum'ah (i.e. ability to be Metamei). If a k'Zayis of Chelev shriveled to less than a Shi'ur, one who eats it is not liable for eating Pigul, Nosar or Chelev;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was left in the rain and returned to its original size, it is again Tamei (or one is liable for eating it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This refutes anyone who holds that Dichuy applies to Isurim (e.g. Shmuel, according to Rabah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TAKING TERUMAH ACCORDING TO VOLUME OR NUMBER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Beraisa):</span> If separates fresh figs as Terumah or Ma'aser for dried figs, one tithes according to the number of figs (even though figs that have been dried are smaller in volume than fresh figs).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like Shmuel, who follows the original volume;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to Rav, who follows the current volume, a tenth of the number is more than a tenth of the volume. This is too much Ma'aser!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one takes too much Ma'aser, the produce he wanted to exempt is indeed exempt, but the Ma'aser is messed up. (Only 10% became Ma'aser. It is mixed with Tevel, i.e. the excess above 10%.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> If we follow the original volume, the Seifa is difficult!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa of Beraisa):</span> When separating dried figs as Terumah or Ma'aser for fresh figs, one measures them based on their volume.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is like Rav, who follows the current volume;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>According to Shmuel, who follows the original volume, this is too much!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to both questions):</span> The Beraisa discusses Terumah Gedolah. In both cases he tithes generously. (For Terumah Gedolah, this is praiseworthy.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa of Beraisa - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> My father would take 10 dry figs to exempt 90 moist figs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not normal to take a tenth for Terumah Gedolah. (One who is generous take one part in 40.) Surely this was Ma'aser!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Beraisa discusses Terumas Ma'aser. It is like R. Aba Elazar ben Gomel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Aba Elazar ben Gomel):</span> "V'Nechshav Lachem Trumaschem (ka'Dagan Min ha'Goren)" discusses (and equates) two Terumos, Terumah Gedolah and Terumas Ma'aser:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like Terumah Gedolah is taken by estimation and may be designated with mere intent (without an action or words), also Terumas Ma'aser;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Just like Terumah Gedolah may be taken generously (one may take a lot, even though any amount suffices), also Terumas Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="normal"></p></div>
