<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE TZIBUR SUPPLIES THE WOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It was obvious to the Tana of the Beraisa that the Tzibur supplies the wood. What is the source?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Answer (Beraisa - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon) Suggestion: Perhaps one who vows to bring an Olah must supply the wood, just like he must supply the Nesachim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Al ha'Etzim Asher Al ha'Esh Asher Al ha'Mizbe'ach" - just like the Tzibur pays for the Mizbe'ach, it pays for the wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar ben Shamu'a says, just like the Mizbe'ach was not used for one's (Chulin) needs, also the wood and fire.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Elazar ben Shamu'a requires new wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, all agree that old wood may be used - "...ha'Bakar la'Olah veha'Morigim u'Chlei ha'Bakar la'Etzim"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Kelim were new (they had never been used).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are "Morigim"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> This is the Tarbal bed (mentioned in Maseches Parah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Tarbal bed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is a wooden block with sharp grooves for threshing grain. We learn from "l'Morag Charutz Chodosh Ba'al Pipiyos Tadush."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A KOMETZ THAT BECAME MIXED WITH ANOTHER MINCHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kometz became mixed with the Kometz of a different Minchah, or with (a Minchah that is not Nikmetzes, such as) the Minchah of a Kohen or (Chavitei) Kohen Gadol or Minchas Nesachim, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah is Posel if it was mixed with Minchas Kohen Gadol or Nesachim, for they contain a larger proportion of oil than a Kometz, and the Kometz and the Minchah absorb from each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - another Mishnah):</span> If blood became mixed with water, if it still looks like blood, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If it became mixed with wine, we consider the wine to be like water. (I.e. it is as if the blood became mixed with an equal amount of water);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If it became mixed with blood of a (Chulin) Behemah or Chayah (Shitah Mekubetzes - some explain, blood that came out while the animal was alive, i.e. from bloodletting), we consider the (Chulin) blood to be like water;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, blood is not Mevatel blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Both of them expound the same verse, "v'Lakach mi'Dam ha'Par umi'Dam ha'Sa'ir." It is known that a bull has more blood than a goat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Implied question:</span> The goat's blood should be Batel in the bull's blood. Why does it say "umi'Dam ha'Sa'ir", which shows that it is not Batel?)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim):</span> This teaches that Olim (things offered on the Mizbe'ach) are not Mevatel each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> This teaches that Min b'Mino (a mixture of the same species) is not Batel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can Chachamim infer that Olim are not Mevatel each other? Perhaps there is no Bitul because it is Min b'Mino!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah taught a case other than Olim in which Min b'Mino is not Batel, indeed, they would learn that Min b'Mino is not Batel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since the Torah taught a case of Olim, surely it is because Olim are not Batel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps both are required, i.e. Olim are not Batel only when they are Min b'Mino!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can R. Yehudah infer that Min b'Mino is not Batel? Perhaps there is no Bitul because they are Olim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah taught a case of Olim that is Min b'Eino Mino, indeed, they would learn that Olim are not Batel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since the Torah taught a case of Min b'Mino, surely it is because Min b'Mino is not Batel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps both are required, i.e. Olim that are Min b'Mino!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If it was mixed with Minchas Kohen Gadol or Nesachim it is Pasul, for they contain a larger proportion of oil than a Kometz, and they absorb from each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if they absorb from each other, why is it Pasul? This is Min b'Mino! (Nothing is Batel. The entire Kometz and the entire Minchah are offered, albeit mixed together!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> R. Yehudah holds that if something is mixed with Min and Eino Mino, we ignore Mino, and Eino Mino (if there is enough), is Mevatel it.</p></div>
