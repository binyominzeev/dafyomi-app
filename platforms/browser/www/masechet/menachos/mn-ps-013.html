<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not a Chidush. The previous Mishnah teaches this explicitly!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he intended to eat a k'Zayis b'Chutz and a k'Zayis tomorrow, or vice-versa; or, for half a k'Zayis tomorrow and half a k'Zayis outside, or vice-versa, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> The Chidush of our Mishnah is the inference, that intents to eat join for Pigul, even for things not normally eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The previous Mishnah contradicts this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> Our Mishnah teaches that intents for eating and Haktarah do not join.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We infer this from the previous Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Two intents to eat do not join if one is for something not normally eaten - surely, intent to eat and Lehaktir do not join!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and defense of  Suggestion #2):</span> Indeed, it teaches that intents for eating and Haktarah do not join;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that two intents to eat (in the previous Mishnah) do not join because one of them is abnormal, but intent to eat and Lehaktir join, for both are normal.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>INTENT FOR A MATIR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yosi admits that if Kemitzah was done with intent to eat the Shirayim tomorrow or be Maktir the Kometz tomorrow, the Minchah is Pigul, and there is Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi says, if he intended to be Maktir the Levonah tomorrow, the Minchah is Pasul, and there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chachamim say, it is Pigul, and to there is Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> This is no different than a Zevach! (Intent to be Maktir Eimurim makes Pigul!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> That is different, for blood, meat and Chelev are all the same Min (species, i.e. all are from the animal), but Levonah is not from the Min of (the Kometz, i.e. of) the Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why must the Mishnah teach that R. Yosi admits in the first case?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the Seifa, R. Yosi exempts (from Kares) regarding intent for Levonah. One might have thought that he holds that intent for part of the Matirim does not make Pigul, and he exempts also in the first case.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> If he intended to be Maktir the Levonah tomorrow, the Minchah is Pasul, and there is no Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> R. Yosi holds that one Matir is not Mefagel another Matir;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The same applies to the two Bazichei (spoons of) Levonah that permit Lechem ha'Panim. One is not Mefagel the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that R. Yosi exempts from Kares in the Mishnah because Levonah is a different Min than the Minchah, but Levonah can be Mefagel Levonah, for they are the same Min;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Reish Lakish teaches that this is not true.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that R. Yosi exempts because Levonah is not from (the Min of) the Minchah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means that Levonah is not a part of the Minchah that is Me'ukav (by Haktaras ha'Kometz), i.e. Levonah can be offered before the Kometz, whereas Shirayim may not be eaten before this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Kometz or Levonah may be offered first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say that one Matir is not Mefagel another Matir when they were never in one Kli together. Kometz and Levonah were in one Kli together, so they are Hukve'u (they become like one). Either is Mefagel the other.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>REMOVING THE LEVONAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> If a Zar took the Levonah off a Minchah, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Taking it off is (partial) Holachah (he brings it closer to the Mizbe'ach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that Holachah done without walking is considered Holachah. A Zar may not do Holachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Mari - Mishnah):</span> The general rule regarding Kemitzah, Nesinah in another Kli, Holachah or Haktarah (when they make Pigul...)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(The four Avodos that can be Mefagel a Minchah correspond to the four Avodos of Zevachim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand three of these. Kemitzah corresponds to slaughter (separating the part to be offered to Hash-m), Holachah corresponds to Holachah, and Haktarah corresponds to Zerikah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Can we say that Nesinah in a Kli resembles Kabalah?! Kabalah happens by itself! (The blood falls into the bucket.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that since Nesinah is indispensable, even though it does not resemble Kabalah, it is considered an Avodah. The same applies to taking Levonah off a Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (Indispensability does not cause something to be considered an Avodah.) Nesinah indeed resembles Kabalah. The essence of both is Kedushas Kli;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The fact that one is active and the other passive is irrelevant.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PARTIAL PIGUL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the two lambs (Shalmei Tzibur of Shavu'os, which accompany Shtei ha'Lechem) were slaughtered with intent to eat one of the loaves tomorrow, or if Haktarah of the two Bazichei Levonah was with intent to eat one of the two Sedarim (sets of six loaves of Lechem ha'Panim) tomorrow:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi says, the loaf or Seder intended for is Pigul, and there is Kares for (eating) it. The other is only Pasul, and there is no Kares for it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, both are Pigul, and there is Kares for them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> R. Yosi would hold that if one was Mefagel in the right thigh, the left thigh is not Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can learn from reasoning or from a verse:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Reasoning - intent does not forbid more than Tum'ah. If one limb became Tamei, it would not be Metamei others (unless it was still connected);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A verse - "veha'Nefesh ha'Ocheles Mimenu Avono Tisa" - from it, but not from other Kodesh (for which there was no intent).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman - Beraisa #1):</span> There is Kares only if he was Mefagel (intended to eat Chutz li'Zmano) a (total of a) k'Zayis b'Shteihem (from both loaves).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he intended to eat only from one, there would be no Pigul!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They say that intent for one makes Pigul!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>If both thighs are considered like one entity (because they come from the same Korban, and the same applies to Shtei ha'Lechem), we understand why intents (for half a k'Zayis from each loaf) join;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>However, if the thighs are considered like two entities, intents for the two loaves should not join!</p></div>
