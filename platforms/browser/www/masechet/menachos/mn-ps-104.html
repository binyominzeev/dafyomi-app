<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Rebbi's house relied on R. Yehudah for rulings. He taught as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> The following six laws are leniencies of Beis Shamai and stringencies of Beis Hillel. (Our Gemara brings only the one relevant to our discussion.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Beis Shamai are Metaher Dam Neveilah. Beis Hillel are Metamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, Beis Hillel are Metamei only when there is a Revi'is, since it can congeal to a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A NEDAVAH OF WINE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not bring a Nedavah of one, two or five Lugim of wine (for this amount is never brought for (any combination of) Nesachim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We may bring three Lugim (the size of Niskei Keves), four (like Niskei Ayil), six or any greater number of Lugim. (Any multiple of three (no less than six) corresponds to a whole number of Nesachim for lambs. If a number is one (or two) more than a multiple of three, we substitute one (or two) ram(s) for one (or two) lamb(s).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Are Nesachim fixed? (Rashi - if one vowed to bring a certain amount, must he bring it all at once? Tosfos - if he vowed, he must immediately bring an amount that can be brought, no less than his vow. We ask about one who said 'this wine is a Nedavah.')</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Reuven brought five Lugim:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If we say that Nesachim are not fixed, he can offer four. The extra Log will be Nedavah (it itself, or wine bought with its redemption money will be combined with other wine for Niskei Tzibur);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If Nesachim are fixed, it cannot be offered until a sixth Log is added.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Answer #1 (Abaye - Mishnah) There were six boxes for Nedavah (money to buy Nidvos Tzibur.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why were there six?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They correspond to six Mosaros, of Chatas, Asham, Asham Nazir, Asham Metzora, Kinim (Chatas ha'Of and Olas ha'Of) and Minchas Chotei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If Nesachim are not fixed, there should have been a seventh box for Nedavah, i.e. Mosar Nesachim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, there are boxes only for money of Mosaros that must be saved for Nedavah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mosar Nesachim is very common. Usually it can be joined to other people's Mosar Nesachim and (it itself is) offered the same day. We need not (redeem it and) store the money.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava - Beraisa):</span> "Ezrach" teaches that one may bring Nesachim for Nedavah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much does one bring?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He brings three Lugim (equal to the smallest Nesech of any animal).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to permit bringing more?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Yihyeh".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he may bring less?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Rejection It says "Kachah".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa expounded that one may 'bring more.' What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot mean bringing four or six. No verse is needed for them, for they correspond to Niskei Eilim and Parim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it means that he may bring five, i.e. Nesachim are not fixed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> We do not bring a Nedavah of one, two or five Lugim of wine;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Presumably, the law of five is like that of (one or) two, i.e. one cannot bring even part of it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need not say so. Their laws can be different! (One who vowed five brings four now...)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If Nesachim are not fixed, the law is clear. (Whatever may be offered, we offer. The rest is Nedavah);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Nesachim are fixed, surely any amount from six until 10 is offered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, if one brings 11, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">104b----------------------------------------104b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Do we say that he intends to bring Nesachim for two bulls (12), therefore he must bring 12?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, perhaps he intends to bring Nesachim for two rams and a sheep?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Is it normal to bring Nesachim corresponding to different animals (more than just one of each), or not? (If it is normal, surely this is his intent. We would not suspect that he brought an incomplete Nesech.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A NEDAVAH OF OIL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> One may bring a Nedavah of wine, but not of oil;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Tarfon says, one may bring a Nedavah (even) of oil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> We find that wine is brought Chovah (i.e. with a Korban) and Nedavah. Likewise oil, which is brought Chovah, may be brought Nedavah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> You cannot learn from wine. When it is brought Chovah (i.e. with a Korban), it is offered by itself. When oil is brought Chovah, it is mixed (with the Minchah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Two partners may not bring (a Minchah of) one Isaron, but they may bring a (Behemah for an) Olah, Shelamim or even one bird.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava):</span> We learn from R. Akiva and R. Tarfon that one may offer a Nedavah of Minchas Nesachim every day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Torah teaches about five kinds of Minchas Nedavah (brought by themselves), and there are no others. Rava teaches that this is when one (vowed to bring a Minchah and) did not specify, but if he specifies to bring Minchas Nesachim, he may do so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Two partners may not bring (one Isaron, but they may bring an Olah, Shelamim or even one bird).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Regarding Minchah it says "Takriv" (singular).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Similarly, regarding Olah it says "Yakriv"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Olah it says "l'Oloseichem" (to permit partnership).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Similarly, regarding Minchah it says "l'Minchoseichem"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Regarding Minchah it says "Nefesh".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "Asher Yakriv Korbano l'Chol Nidreihem ul'Chol Nidvosam Asher Yakrivu la'Shem" teaches that everything may be brought in partnership. The Torah excludes only Minchah, there it says "Nefesh".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak):</span> Why does it say "Nefesh" only regarding Minchah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Usually a poor person brings a Minchah. Hash-m considers it as if he offered his soul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak):</span> Why are there five kinds of Minchas Nedavah with oil?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A parable explains this. The king's friend prepared a meal for the king. The king knew that his friend was poor, so he requested that he make five kinds of fried foods, in order that the meal will be pleasing.</p></div>
<div class="perekline"><p>PEREK HAREI ALAI ISARON</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>VAGUE VOWS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'Alai (it is incumbent on me to bring) an Isaron', he must bring (a Minchah of) one Isaron;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he said 'Alai Esronim', he must bring two Esronim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he (knows that he) specified how many Esronim he will bring, but does not remember the amount, he must bring 60 Esronim (the largest possible Minchah. If he vowed less, the excess is Nedavah (Rashash. Sefas Emes - he volunteers to increase his vow to 60).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If he said 'Alai Minchah', he may bring any (of the five types of) Minchas Nedavah that he wants;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he must bring Minchas Soles, for this is the choice Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If he said '(Alai) Minchah', or 'a type of Minchah', he must bring one Minchah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If he said 'Menachos', or 'a type of Menachos', he must bring two Menachos;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>If he specified which type he will bring, but does not remember which, he must bring all five kinds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>If he vowed 'A Minchah of (a certain number of) Esronim', but does not remember the amount, he must bring 60 Esronim. (We are not concerned lest he vowed more than this, for this is not normal);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Rebbi says, he must bring Menachos of every size, from one Isaron until 60 (60 Menachos in all).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Objection:</span> The first law ('Alai Isaron') is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is taught due to the next law, 'Alai Esronim'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also this is obvious! 'Esronim' is at least two!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is taught due to the next law, when he specified but does not remember the amount.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he specified but does not remember the amount, he must bring 60 Esronim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> It is not Rebbi, for he says (in the Seifa) that he must bring Menachos of every size, from one until 60.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (and Answer #2 - R. Yochanan):</span> It is even like Rebbi. The case is, he specified how much he will bring, but he did not vow to bring them in one Kli;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He brings 60 Esronim, each in its own Kli (no matter what he vowed, he is Yotzei. In the Seifa, he specified to bring them in one Kli, therefore he must bring Menachos of every size.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'Alai Minchah', he may bring any Minchas Nedavah... (R. Yehudah obligates bringing Soles, the choice Minchah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This (R. Yehudah's opinion) is because the Torah taught about Minchas Soles first.</p></div>
