<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>PERMITTED HARVESTING BEFORE THE OMER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may harvest due to young trees, to make room for Birkas Avelim, or for people to learn.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are all of these permitted? (According to the explanation that 'due to trees' is to avoid a loss (which is not a Mitzvah), we must say that grain sprouted in a tree field. We already know that this is permitted (for the Omer may not come from a tree field), we only ask about the latter two cases.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah forbids "Ketzirchem (your harvesting)", but not harvesting for the sake of a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not tie bundles of grain, one may make bundles without tying them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We minimize exertion (lest one come to eat Chodosh).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>REAPING THE OMER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> L'Chatchilah, barley should be cut (Lishmah) for the Omer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> It says "v'Im Takriv Minchas Bikurim." Why does the end of the verse repeat "Takriv"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> L'Chatchilah, barley should be cut for the Omer. The extra "Takriv" teaches that if there is no attached barley, we may use detached sheaves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> L'Chatchilah, the barley should be moist.The extra "Takriv" teaches that if there is no moist barley, we may use dry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> L'Chatchilah, it should be cut at night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if it was cut during the day, it is Kosher, and that it is Docheh Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The extra "Takriv" teaches that may be offered in any case (even from pre-cut sheaves), from any place (even though it will be dry when it gets to Yerushalayim), even on Shabbos, and even b'Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it was cut during the day, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> The entire night is Kosher for reaping the Omer, and Haktarah of Chelev and limbs;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The general rule is, anything Kosher during the daytime is Kosher the entire day. Anything Kosher at night is Kosher the entire night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This equates day and night. Just like daytime Mitzvos may not be done at night, nighttime Mitzvos may not be done by day!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution (Rava):</span> Our Mishnah is like Rebbi. That Mishnah is like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If a Kohen was offering the Omer (during the day) and it became Tamei, if there is more grain available, we harvest it and offer it; if not, we tell him to be quiet. (If people know that it was brought b'Tum'ah, they might think that even Korbanos Yachid may be brought b'Tum'ah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, in either case we tell him to be quiet, for if the Omer was harvested improperly (i.e. during the day), it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DOES REAPING THE OMER OVERRIDE SHABBOS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon holds like R. Akiva, the Rebbi of his father, and like R. Yishmael:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> Any Melachah (for the sake of circumcision) that can be done before Shabbos does not override Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> (The Torah says to refrain from plowing and reaping on Shabbos.) Just like plowing is optional (we never find a Mitzvah to plow), also reaping;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This excludes reaping the Omer. It is a Mitzvah, and it overrides Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If an Omer harvested improperly were Kosher, reaping would not override Shabbos. We would have to reap before Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> If the Omer was harvested improperly, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also Rebbi was a Talmid of R. Shimon! (Also he should have heard R. Akiva's opinion from him, and held like it!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> When we learned from R. Shimon, we would bring to him (on Shabbos) oil and a towel, transferring them from Chatzer to roof, from roof to Karfef (an enclosed place without a roof), and from Karfef to Karfef, until we reached the bathing spring. (This teaches that R. Shimon permits transferring between these places without an Eruv. Our Gemara cites the Beraisa merely to show that Rebbi was his Talmid.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rebbi holds like another teaching of R. Shimon:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> A Mitzvah in its time is great. Limbs (of an Olah) and Chelev can be burned all night, but (l'Chatchilah) we burn them during the day (even on Shabbos)!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">72b----------------------------------------72b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, R. Elazar heard this teaching of his father! (How does he infer that an improperly harvested Omer is Pasul? Perhaps dearness of the Mitzvah overrides Shabbos!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Indeed, he heard it.) Limbs are different. Since Shechitah already overrode Shabbos, also Haktarah does. (However, we do not begin Melachah on Shabbos, e.g. reaping, if the Mitzvah can be done another day.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>(This answer is sound. Surely Rebbi agrees that we can distinguished like this. Answer #1 is insufficient!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rebbi holds that reaping the Omer does not override Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> Whether it was (reaped) on Shabbos or on a weekday, it is sifted from three Sa'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi argues with that.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> Whether or not it is Shabbos, it is reaped by three people, each with his own sickle and box.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi argues with that.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If it is Shabbos, each asks 'is it Shabbos?' (and they reap)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi argues with that.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If it was cut during the day, it is Kosher. It overrides Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi is the Tana who says that if it was cut during the day, it is Kosher, and the Mishnah says that it overrides Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It means that reaping the Omer overrides Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means that Hakravas ha'Omer overrides Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi holds that reaping the Omer does override Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi) Question:</span> What do we learn from "va'Ydaber Moshe Es Mo'adei Hash-m"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "b'Mo'ado" regarding the Tamid and Korban Pesach, to teach that they may be offered on Shabbos and b'Tum'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for other Korbanos Tzibur?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Eleh Ta'asu la'Shem b'Mo'adeichem." (This is in Parshas Pinchus, where all the Musafim are taught.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the Omer, Shtei ha'Lechem and the Korbanos that accompany these (in Parshas Emor?)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "va'Ydaber Moshe Es Mo'adei Hash-m" (in that Parshah). Each has a Mo'ed (a fixed time. Therefore, they override Shabbos and Tum'ah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> For what does Rebbi need a source that Shtei ha'Lechem overrides Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot be for the Hakravah. They are totally eaten by Kohanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He needs a source for grinding and sifting them on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>(These could have been done before Shabbos, nevertheless they override Shabbos.) Similarly, reaping the Omer overrides Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, offering the Omer overrides Shabbos, just like baking Shtei ha'Lechem overrides Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi holds that the oven is Mekadesh Shtei ha'Lechem. It cannot be baked the day before, for it would become Nifsal due to Linah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>Question Rebbi does not hold that the oven is Mekadesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Kivsei Atzeres are Mekadesh the bread only through Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they were slaughtered Lishmah and Zerikah was Lishmah, they are Mekadesh the bread;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If Shechitah and Zerikah were Lo Lishmah, they are not Mekadesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rebbi says, if Shechitah was Lishmah and Zerikah was Lo Lishmah, the bread is Kadosh and not Kadosh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, it is not Kadosh unless Shechitah and Zerikah were both Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> When the Tana'im in this Beraisa say 'Kadosh', they mean 'Kove'a.' (The bread cannot be brought with other lambs.)</p></div>
