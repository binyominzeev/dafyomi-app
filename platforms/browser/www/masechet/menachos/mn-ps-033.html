<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Mezuzah was written on two Dapim (Tosfos - parchments; Rashi - columns), it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Mezuzah was written in two Dapim and one was put on each doorpost, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If both were put on the same doorpost, it would be Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means that if it was possible to (Rashi - cut between the columns and) put one Parshah on each doorpost, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHERE TO PUT THE MEZUZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Tzir determines where to put the Mezuzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Tzir?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada):</span> It is the holder of the door hinge.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When does this apply?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It applies to a house divided into two, one side each for men and women, in order that the women will not encounter men (each has its own opening to Reshus ha'Rabim). There is a door between them. Whichever side the hinge is on is considered the primary house. The Mezuzah is put on the right side of one who enters it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Reish Galusa built a house. He asked Rav Nachman (his son-in-law) to affix the Mezuzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 -Tosfos - Rav Nachman:</span> First attach the door (so I will know where to put the Mezuzah. The house was divided like above.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 -Rashi - Rav Nachman:</span> First attach the doorposts to the sides of the opening. (If a Mezuzah is attached to the doorpost and then the doorpost is attached to the opening, the Mezuzah is fixed in the opening 'by itself', the Mitzvah is not fulfilled.) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Mezuzah was attached like a bolt, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yitzchak bar Yosef reported that all the Mezuzos in Rebbi's house were (Rosh - slanted; alternatively, bent) like bolts, and that there was no Mezuzah on Rebbi's opening (Tosfos - from his house) to the Beis Medrash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the Mezuzah rests like a horizontal bolt, it is Pasul (Rashi; R. Tam - Kosher);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is vertical (Rashi; alternatively, bent like the letter 'Nun'), it is Kosher (Rashi; R. Tam - Pasul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (R. Yitzchak said that that there was no Mezuzah on Rebbi's opening to the Beis Medrash). However, there was a Mezuzah on Rav Huna's opening to the Beis Medrash!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is because he (Rashi - many people) normally went through that opening.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Normal usage determines the law regarding Mezuzah. (I.e. if a room has two openings, we put the Mezuzah on the opening used more often.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira citing Shmuel):</span> One should put the Mezuzah at the beginning of the top third of the doorway.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> It must be at least one Tefach above the floor and at least one Tefach below the ceiling, anywhere in this range is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against R. Zeira - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> It must be at least one Tefach above the floor and at least one Tefach below the ceiling, anywhere in this range is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi says, "u'Kshartam (Tefilin)... u'Chsavtam (a Mezuzah)" - just like Tefilin are worn on the highest part (Rashi - of the head), Mezuzah is affixed on the upper part of the doorpost.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav Huna holds like R. Yehudah, but Shmuel is not like either Tana!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Noson):</span> Really, he holds like R. Yosi. Shmuel said 'at the beginning of the top third', i.e. one should not distance it from the top more than a third of the height of the doorway.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHERE TO PUT THE MEZUZAH (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Mezuzah should be affixed in the Tefach closest to Reshus ha'Rabim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabanan):</span> In this way, one encounters the Mitzvah as soon as possible, when entering the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina of Sura):</span> In this way, the entire house (inside from the Mezuzah) is protected.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Hash-m's ways are unlike mortal's ways. A mortal king sits inside, and his servants guard him from the outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Hash-m's servants (Yisrael) are inside (their houses. They affix a Mezuzah), and He guards them from the outside - "Hash-m Shomrecha Hash-m Tzilcha Al Yad Yeminecha."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef brei d'Rava):</span> If the Mezuzah was put a Tefach into the wall, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If it was put in a doorpost, or if one covered it over with a doorframe:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is more than a Tefach from the opening, another Mezuzah must be affixed. If it is less than a Tefach, no other Mezuzah is needed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The Beraisa discusses Achorei ha'Deles (a minor opening to the side of the main opening; alternatively - on the other side of the corner). If the wall separating the Mezuzah from the other opening is less than a Tefach, the Mezuzah exempts the other opening as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa explicitly teaches Achorei ha'Deles! (The Reisha must teach something else.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa explains the Reisha.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a doorframe was made of reeds, he cuts a tube-shaped opening and inserts the Mezuzah in it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> He must do it in this order. If he cut the hole, inserted the Mezuzah and then attached the frame to the door, it is Pasul. One must affix the Mezuzah to the doorpost, but not attach a doorpost with a Mezuzah to the opening.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHICH OPENINGS REQUIRE A MEZUZAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A desolate opening (this will be explained) is exempt from Mezuzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a desolate opening?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Richumi or Aba Yosi):</span> The opening does not have a (Tosfos - smooth) ceiling. (Alternatively - the room has no ceiling);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of Rav Richumi and Aba Yosi):</span> The opening does not have (Tosfos - smooth) doorposts. (Alternatively - it has no lintel);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Shila):</span> An Achsadra (a three-walled room, one side is open) is exempt from Mezuzah because it has no doorposts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that if it has (beams like) doorposts, it requires a Mezuzah. However, they are not really doorposts. They are merely supports for the ceiling!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, an Achsadra is exempt even if it has doorposts, for they are merely supports for the ceiling.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> I saw Rabah's Achsadra. It had doorposts, but no Mezuzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that they are merely supports for the ceiling.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A Beis Sha'ar (guard-house at the entrance to a Chatzer), Achsadra or porch must have a Mezuzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That refers to an Achsadra of Bei Rav. (It has four walls, but they do not reach to the ceiling.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Achsadra of Bei Rav is a proper room! (There is no need to teach it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it refers to a Roman Achsadra (hut, the walls are full of openings. These are Rashi's definitions of Achsadra of Bei Rav and a Roman Achsadra. Bach switches these to conform to Rashi's Pirush on Bava Basra).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rachbah):</span> Bei Harziki requires two Mezuzos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Bei Harziki?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa Sava):</span> It is a Beis Sha'ar open to a Chatzer, and houses are open to it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> If a Beis Sha'ar is open to a garden and Kitonis (a small room), it is like the Kitonis (this will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>Chachamim say, it is like a Beis Sha'ar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> All agree that the opening of the Beis Sha'ar to the Kitonis requires a Mezuzah. (Rashi prefers to say that this is if the hinges are on the side of the Kitonis.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is an entrance of the Kitonis!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The Tana'im argue about the opening of the Beis Sha'ar to the garden;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yosi holds that this Beis Sha'ar is made primarily for the sake of (entering and leaving) the Kitonis, therefore all its openings are obligated (even if the hinges are on the side of the garden), like a regular Beis Sha'ar;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Chachamim hold that this Beis Sha'ar is made primarily for the sake of the garden, therefore, the openings between it and the garden are unimportant (and exempt).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> All agree that the opening of the Beis Sha'ar to the garden is exempt.</p></div>
