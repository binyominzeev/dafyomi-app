<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CHECKING TECHELES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are ways to check Techeles!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yitzchak brei d'Rav Yehudah would bring alum, fenugreek juice and urine of a baby 40 days old (alternatively - that was emitted 40 days ago) and soak the Techeles in the mixture overnight. If the color was ruined, it is Kala Ilan. If not, it is Techeles.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav Ada taught that one bakes it in a potent sourdough of barley. If the color improves, it is Techeles. If not, it is Kala Ilan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is no way to check if Techeles was dyed Lishmah. (Perhaps it was a sample! Therefore we must buy it from an expert.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Mar (a Chacham) bought Techeles. It failed the test of R. Yitzchak, but passed the test of Rav Ada. He thought that it was invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Achai:</span> Will you say that it is neither Techeles nor Kala Ilan?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, we must say that the two tests complement each other. If it passes the test of R. Yitzchak, it is Kosher. If not, we apply the test of Rav Ada;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it passes, it is Kosher; if not, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> The two tests complement each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rav Mani (bought and sold Techeles. He) was careful to buy only from experts (R. Gershom - and to perform the tests), like the stringencies of the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">An elder:</span> Techeles merchants before you did so, and their business prospered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one buys a garment with Techeles from a Yisrael, it is Muchzak to be Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>If he bought from a regular Nochri, it is Pasul. (We are concerned lest he dyed it himself Lo Lishmah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he bought from an (R. Gershom - established) Nochri merchant, it is Muchzak to be Kosher, even though Yisraelim may not sell garments with Tzitzis to Nochrim. (Surely he bought it from a Yisrael. He is afraid to lose his reputation.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it forbidden to sell to a Nochri?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Bavel):</span> Perhaps a harlot will assume that the wearer is a Yisrael, and agree to have relations with him. (Alternatively - perhaps the Nochri will give it to a Nochris harlot for her services, and she will say that a certain Yisrael gave it to her, and people will suspect him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> Perhaps one who sees the Nochri wearing Tzitzis will assume that he is a Yisrael, and accompany him, and the Nochri will kill him.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TO WHOM DOES THE MITZVAH APPLY?I</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav Yehudah put Tzitzis on his wife's garment, and he would bless on it (R. Gershom; Rashi - his garment) every morning 'Lehis'atef b'Tzitzis'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since he holds that women are obligated, he must hold that the Mitzvah is not Zman Gerama (rather, it applies at all times). If so, why did he bless every morning?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like Rebbi (and equates Tzitzis and Tefilin);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Every time one puts on Tefilin, he blesses on them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should have blessed every time he put on Tzitzis!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He dressed modestly. He would not take off his garment the entire day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Surely, he sometimes rose before morning to learn.) He should have blessed when he put on the garment, even if this was before morning!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When morning came (R. Gershom - and he would be among people), he would put on the garment that he would wear all day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All are commanded about Tzitzis - Kohanim, Leviyim and Yisraelim, converts, women and slaves;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Shimon exempts women (and slaves), for Tzitzis is Zman Gerama. Women are exempt from all such Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, the Mitzvah applies to Kohanim, Leviyim and Yisraelim. To whom should it apply?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Kohanim are exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah writes the Mitzvah of Tzitzis right after the Isur of Kilayim. This teaches that the Mitzvah applies only to those forbidden to wear Kilayim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since Kilayim is permitted to Kohanim (in Bigdei Kehunah), they should be exempt from Tzitzis!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Kilayim is permitted to Kohanim only for the sake of Avodah. Otherwise (e.g. outside the Mikdash) they are forbidden. (Therefore, they are commanded about Tzitzis.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Shimon exempt women?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "U'Re'isim Oso" excludes a night garment (Tosfos - one normally worn at night; Rashi, Rambam - any garment, at night);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it rather excludes a blind person's garment!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher Techaseh Bah" includes a blind person's garment. Therefore, "u'Re'isim Oso" excludes a night garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The verses do not specify which to include or exclude.) Perhaps we include a night garment and exclude that of a blind person?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to include the garment of a blind person, for others see (the Techeles on) it, but no one sees a night garment.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">43b----------------------------------------43b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound "Asher Techaseh Bah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They expound like the following Beraisa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Al Arba Kanfos Kesusecha Asher Techaseh Bah" obligates a four cornered garment, but not a three cornered garment;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we exclude a five cornered garment!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher Techaseh Bah" includes a five cornered garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we include a three cornered garment and exclude a five cornered garment!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>We exclude a three cornered garment, for it does not have four corners. We include a five cornered garment, for it has four corners.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>R. Shimon used "Asher Techaseh Bah" to include a blind person's garment. He uses "Asher" to include a five cornered garment.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BENEFITS OF THE MITZVAH OF TZITZIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound "u'Re'isim Oso"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They expound like the one of the following Beraisos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "U'Re'isim Oso u'Zchartem" - you should see it (the Techeles) and remember a Mitzvah that depends on Techeles, i.e. Keri'as Shma;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The time to read Keri'as Shma (in the morning) is when it is light enough to distinguish between (Tzitzis of) Lavan and Techeles.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> "U'Re'isim Oso u'Zchartem" - you should see it and remember another Mitzvah written next to it, i.e. Kilayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Beraisa #3):</span> "U'Re'isim Oso u'Zchartem Es Kol Mitzvosai" - once one is obligated in the Mitzvah of Tzitzis (i.e., when he becomes Bar Mitzvah) he is obligated in all the Mitzvos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa #3):</span> "U'Re'isim Oso u'Zchartem Es Kol Mitzvosai" - once one is obligated in the Mitzvah of Tzitzis (i.e., when it is light enough to distinguish between the Lavan and Techeles) he is obligated in all the Mitzvos (that apply only during the day); (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is like R. Shimon (who exempts women. According to Chachamim, women are obligated in Tzitzis, but not in all the Mitzvos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #4):</span> "U'Re'isim Oso u'Zchartem Es Kol Mitzvosai" - Tzitzis is equivalent to all the Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #5):</span> "U'Re'isim Oso u'Zchartem...va'Asisem" - seeing (Techeles) brings to remembering (the Mitzvos), which brings to doing (them);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>R. Shimon says, anyone who is zealous to fulfill this Mitzvah merits to behold the Shechinah. It says "u'Re'isim Oso", and it says "Es Hash-m Elokecha Tira v'Oso Sa'avod." (In both, 'Oso' refers to the Shechinah; alternatively, we expound 'Tira' (you will fear) as if it said 'Tireh' (you will see).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yisrael are dear to Hash-m, He surrounded us with Mitzvos - Tefilin on the head and arm, Tzitzis on the garment, and Mezuzah on the doorway;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Sheva ba'Yom Hilalticha" (David praised for these seven Mitzvos, i.e. two Tefilin, four Tzitziyos and one Mezuzah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When David entered the bathhouse, he was dismayed that he was bare of Mitzvos. He remembered his circumcision and was comforted;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>When he left he composed "Lamnatze'ach Al ha'Sheminis", out of appreciation of circumcision, which was given on the eighth day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, anyone who has Tefilin on his head and arm, Tzitzis on the garment and Mezuzah on the doorway, he is firm that he will not sin - "veha'Chut ha'Meshulash Lo vi'Mherah Yinasek."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It also says "Choneh Mal'ach Hash-m Soviv li'Yre'av".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Hash-m chose to put Techeles on Tzitzis, because its color resembles the sea (to remind Yisrael of Hash-m's miracles at the sea), which resembles the sky, which resembles the Kisei ha'Kavod;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "...Livnas ha'Sapir uch'Etzem ha'Shamayim la'Tohar", and it says "k'Mar'e Even Sapir Demus Kisei."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The punishment for one who does not fulfill Lavan is greater than that for one who does not fulfill Techeles (for the latter is more expensive);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A parable for this is a king who asked one servant to bring a Chosam (identification bracelet) made of mud, and another servant to bring one made of gold. They were negligent and did not do so;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The former will be punished more.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>BLESSINGS THAT ONE SHOULD MAKE EVERY DAY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One must make 100 blessings every day - "Mah Hash-m Elokecha Sho'el me'Imach..." (Rashi - we read "Mah" as if it said 'Me'ah (100)'; R. Tam  - there are 100 letters in this verse.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>(On a weekday, the Tefilos and two meals comprise 100 blessings.) On Shabbos and Yom Tov (there are less blessings in Tefilah) R. Chiya brei d'Rav Avya would bless on fragrances and delicacies to fulfill 100 blessings.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One must make the following three blessings every day - 'that You made me a Yisrael', 'that You did not make me a woman (who is exempt from Mitzvos Aseh sheha'Zman Gerama), and 'that You did not make me a Bor (unlearned, undisciplined person).'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The son of Rav Acha bar Yakov blessed 'that You did not make me a Bor.' His father rebuked him (for considering himself to be learned, or because a Bor is obligated in the Mitzvos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">His son:</span> What should I bless in place of it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Acha:</span> Bless 'that You did not make me a slave.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is the same as 'that You did not make me a woman'! (Both are commanded about the same Mitzvos. Alternatively, her husband receives her earnings!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more disgraceful to be a slave. (Alternatively, in any case, make a third blessing, even though there is no Chidush in it.)</p></div>
