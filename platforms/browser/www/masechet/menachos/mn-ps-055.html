<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TAKING MOIST OR DRY FIGS TO BE TERUMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa is difficult for Rav!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Elazar):</span> R. Yosi would take 10 dry figs to exempt 90 moist figs.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>According to Shmuel, who follows the original volume, this is a tenth;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Rav follows the current volume. This is less than a tenth!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> Dry figs are different (than meat). One can return them to their original state through cooking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Moist figs may be made Terumah on (Rashi - an equal number of) dry figs, in a place where people normally dry their figs;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Dry figs may not be made Terumah on (Rashi - an equal number of) figs, even in a place where people normally dry figs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Beraisa permits tithing figs on dry figs in a place where people normally make dry figs. Elsewhere, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There is a Kohen in the area who can eat them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it is permitted even where people do not normally make dry figs!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In a place where there is a Kohen, we take the nicest produce to be Terumah (even if it does not last so long.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> There is no Kohen in the area.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa forbids making dry figs Terumah on figs, even where people normally make dry figs;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there is no Kohen, this is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In a place where there is no Kohen, we take (for Terumah) produce that will last a long time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that the Seifa discusses a place where there is a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This answer shows it is better to establish a Beraisa in a difficult way (e.g. different clauses discuss different situations) than to say that different Tana'im taught the clauses.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MENACHOS MAY NOT BE MADE CHAMETZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Menachos are kneaded with lukewarm water. (Tif'eres Yisrael - this is best for bread, but it speeds up Chimutz. Therefore,) we must guard them from becoming Chametz - "Kol ha'Minchah Asher Takrivu la'Shem Lo Se'aseh Chametz."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one ferments Shirayim, he transgresses a Lav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He is liable for (every step, i.e.) kneading, arranging the loaves and for baking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of the second law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> "Lo Se'afeh Chametz Chelkam" - even the Kohanim's portion (Shirayim) may not be made Chametz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We use this verse to teach a different law!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Lo Se'afeh Chametz Chelkam"? It already says "Lo Se'aseh Chametz"!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">55b----------------------------------------55b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said only "Lo Se'aseh Chametz", one might have thought that one is lashed only once for all steps of fermenting a Minchah. Therefore, it says "Lo Se'afeh";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Baking was already forbidden, for it is part of making Chametz. It was singled out to equate all steps of making Chametz to it:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Just like baking is a single step in making Chametz and one is liable for it by itself, one is liable for kneading, arranging and for every single step;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>These extra words allude to Kituf (Rashi - smoothing out the surface of the dough with water; R. Gershom - taking pieces for individual loaves from the (big) dough). One is liable for it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish learns from "Chelkam". (The Beraisa learns from "Lo Se'afeh Chametz.")</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the verse teaches only Reish Lakish's law!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said 'Chelkam Lo Se'afeh Chametz;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it says "Lo Se'afeh Chametz Chelkam", to teach both.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should say that "Lo Se'afeh Chametz" obligates for baking alone, and also one Chatas for all the other steps!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Baking is a 'Davar she'Hayah bi'Chlal v'Yatza' (a matter that was part of a general rule), and received a new law). The new law applies to the whole Klal. (Every step is just like baking.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that "Lo Se'aseh" is a Klal, "Lo Se'afeh" is a Prat. From a Klal u'Frat we learn only the Prat (baking!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aftoriki):</span> Because the Klal and Prat are written in different places, we do not expound Klal and Prat.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>KLAL AND PRAT THAT ARE SEPARATED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> We do expound Klal and Prat that are separated!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Shachat Oso (Chatas Nasi) bi'Mkom Asher Yishchat Es ha'Olah Lifnei Hash-m Chatas Hi" - just like Olah is slaughtered in the north, also Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn this from "bi'Mkom Asher Tishachet ha'Olah Tishachet ha'Chatas"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Shachat Oso" teaches that this is Me'akev. If it was slaughtered in the south, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this rather teaches that a Nasi's Chatas requires (Shechitah in) the north, but other Chata'os do not!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Shachat Es ha'Chatas bi'Mkom ha'Olah" is a Binyan Av. It teaches that all Chata'os are slaughtered in the north.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would we have thought (without this verse) that only Se'ir Nasi requires the north?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Even though the Klal and Prat are distanced, we expound Klal u'Prat! (This culminates Question (a). The coming rejection does not answer Question (a), for if we expound Prat u'Chlal even when they are distanced, surely the same applies to Klal u'Frat!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> The Prat precedes the Klal. We should rather expound Prat u'Klal. The Klal expands the Prat to include everything!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question a:6 - Rav Ashi):</span> Rather, the Tana thought to learn from "Oso" that Se'ir Nasi is the only Chatas that must be slaughtered in the north.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In conclusion, "v'Shachat Es ha'Chatas..." teaches that all Chata'os are slaughtered in the north. What do we learn from "Oso"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Oso" - an obligatory Chatas requires Tzafon, but the Chatas of Nachshon (or any other Nasi during Chanukas ha'Mishkan) did not require Tzafon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since Se'ir Nachshon required Semichah, one might have thought that it also required Tzafon. "Oso" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that it required Semichah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "V'Samach Yado Al Rosh ha'Sa'ir" includes the Se'ir Nachshon. (It required Semichah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Shimon says, it includes Se'irim (for He'elam Davar) of idolatry.</p></div>
