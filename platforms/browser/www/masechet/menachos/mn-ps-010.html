<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>EXPOUNDING EXTRA WORDS IN PARSHAS METZORA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from (Rashi - the repetition; Tosfos - the change of words between) "Al Dam ha'Asham" and "Al Makom Dam ha'Asham"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah must write both:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it said only "Al Dam ha'Asham", one might have thought that the oil must be put on the blood, and if the blood was cleaned off the oil cannot be put;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it said only "Al Makom Dam ha'Asham", one might have thought that the blood must be cleaned off, for if it was still there, it would be a Chatzitzah (between the oil and the finger).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(The Torah wrote both, to teach that the oil is put there whether or not the blood is still there.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Granted, the Torah had to write "Al Dam ha'Asham" and "Al Makom Dam ha'Asham." Why must it say "Yemanis" each time?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to R. Zeira, we already learned from the four occurrences of "Smolis" that everywhere else that the Torah discusses a hand, it is the right hand!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We do not learn like R. Zeira. Rather, a Gezerah Shavah "Yad-Yad" (from Metzora) teaches that the right hand is used for Kemitzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Regel-Regel" (from Metzora) teaches that the right foot is used for Chalitzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Ozen-Ozen" teaches that the right ear is Nirtza (i.e. of an Eved Ivri who does not want to leave after six years.).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from the four occurrences of "Smolis"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> This teaches that the Kohen's right hand is Pasul to hold the oil (that a Metzora brings) when sprinkling or putting it on him:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Otherwise, a Kal va'Chomer would have permitted it! Other Avodos are Kosher only with the right hand. Here, even the left hand is Kosher, and all the more so the right hand!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah repeats these words (Smolis, Yad, Regel and Yemanis) regarding a poor Metzora. What do we learn from them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael taught, that a Parshah can be repeated to teach one Chidush. We need not expound extra words that are repeated.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN THE RIGHT HAND IS REQUIRED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Wherever it says 'Etzba' (finger) or 'Kehunah', the right hand is required.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We are thinking that this is only when it says both of them. He learns from "v'Lakach ha'Kohen... b'Etzba'o v'Nasan";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We learn from Metzora (that this refers to the right hand) - "v'Toval ha'Kohen Es Etzba'o ha'Ymanis".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Kemitzah, it only says 'Kohen';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Kemitzah was done with the left hand, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> 'Etzba' or 'Kehunah' by itself teaches that the right hand is required.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Regarding Holachah of limbs (of an Olah) to the Mizbe'ach, it says Kohen - "v'Hikriv ha'Kohen..."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This refers to bringing limbs to the ramp.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (One Kohen carries) the right leg in his left hand. The place where it was cut faces himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Etzba' or 'Kehunah' teaches that the right hand is required regarding something that is Me'akev Kaparah, similar to (sprinkling on a) Metzora (from which we learned).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says 'Kehunah' regarding Kabalah, and it is Me'akev Kaparah (and R. Shimon is Machshir with the left hand)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Kabalah was done with the left hand, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon says that it must say both 'Etzba' and 'Kehunah'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon does not require both!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Wherever it says 'Yad', this refers to the right hand. 'Etzba' always refers to the right finger.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (He holds that) 'Etzba' by itself teaches that the right hand is required. 'Kehunah' by itself does not teach this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from 'Kehunah'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He must be like a Kohen (i.e. wearing Bigdei Kehunah).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Zerikah (R. Tam - Melikah) it only says 'Kehunah';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Zerikah (R. Tam - Melikah) was done with the left hand, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon does not argue!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Beraisa teaches that he argues; (R. Tam and Shitah Mekubetzes delete the next two lines from the text.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (If Kabalah was done with the left hand, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, it is Kosher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If Zerikah (R. Tam - Melikah) was done with the left hand, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Shimon says, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava taught that a Gezerah Shavah "Yad-Yad" teaches that the right hand is used for Kemitzah. This is unnecessary. We learn from "Kohen"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need to learn two things, that the right hand is used for Kemitzah, and for putting the Kometz in another Kli.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> R. Shimon holds that there one need not put the Kometz in another Kli. What does he learn from "Yad-Yad"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Even according to the opinion that R. Shimon requires putting the Kometz in another Kli, R. Shimon permits using the left hand for this. What does he learn from "Yad-Yad"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It does not teach Kemitzah with the right hand. Even though R. Shimon does not learn this from "Kohen" (since it does not say 'Etzba'), he has another source for this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah brei d'R. Chiya):</span> R. Shimon learns from "Kodesh Kodoshim Hi (a Minchah) ka'Chatas vecha'Asham":</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the Kohen wants to offer it (be Maktir the Kometz using his hand, without a Kli) like (Matanos Dam of) Chatas, he uses the right hand, like for Chatas;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If he wants to offer it (using a Kli) like (Matanos Dam of) Asham, he may use the left hand, like for Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> R. Shimon uses "Yad-Yad" to teach that Kemitzah of Minchas Chotei requires the right hand;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since R. Shimon says that the Torah does not want the Korban of a Chotei to be beautiful, one might have thought that Kemitzah with the left hand is Kosher. "Yad-Yad" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
