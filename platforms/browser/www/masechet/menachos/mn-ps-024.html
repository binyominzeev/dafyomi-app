<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DISCONNECTED PARTS OF A MINCHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Bnei R. Chiya):</span> If an Isaron (i.e. a Minchah) is in a Kli in two parts (they do not touch each other), and a Tevul Yom touched one of them, what is the law? (Is the other Pasul?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Mishnah teaches that a Kli joins Kodesh that is inside. Perhaps this is only when it is connected, but not when it is in two parts;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps the law applies in any case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> The Mishnah does not say that a Kli connects (connoting that the Kodesh is connected, and the Kli causes it all to be considered like one), rather, a Kli joins (even if the Kadosh is disconnected)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Bnei R. Chiya):</span> If part of another Minchah was placed between the two pieces (and a Tevul Yom touched the middle piece), what is the law? (Are the others Pesulim?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> A Kli joins its (Kodesh) contents only if they need to be in the same Kli (e.g. parts of one Minchah. This middle piece need not be with the others.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Bnei R. Chiya):</span> If a Tevul Yom put his finger in between the two (disconnected) parts of the Minchah in the Kli, what is the law? (Do we consider it as if the Minchah is connected there, and he was Posel it?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> The only Kli that receives (and causes its contents to receive) Tum'ah from its airspace (without physical contact) is earthenware.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya):</span> May one take Kemitzah from one of the parts? (Is this like taking from the entire Minchah?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Tziruf (all Kodesh in a Kli is considered one) is mid'Oraisa, it always applies, whether this is a stringency or leniency;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Tziruf is mid'Rabanan, this is only a stringency.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Bnei R. Chiya):</span> We can learn from the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two Menachos became mixed together before Kemitzah - if one can take a Kometz from each of them by itself, they are Kesherim. If not, they are Pesulim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> (In the first case) it helps to take a Kemitzah from each Minchah, even though part of it is disconnected (mixed with the other Minchah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Perhaps each Minchah is connected. They are (not truly mixed, rather,) intermeshed like prongs of two forks.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava - Beraisa):</span> "V'Herim Mimenu" - he takes from a connected Minchah. Kemitzah may not be taken from a Minchah in two Kelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Assumption:</span> Even though the Minchah is disconnected, the reason Kemitzah may not be taken is because the Minchah is in two Kelim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Kemitzah may be taken from a disconnected Minchah in one Kli!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> Perhaps the Kelim are joined. One is a cavity hollowed out in the other, and the Minchah is connected above (on the brim of the Kelim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though it is connected above, the walls of the Kli separate them below. (Therefore, one may not take Kemitzah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the corresponding case of a Minchah in one Kli (which may be Nikmetzes)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it was in a feeding trough for chickens (with compartments for water and bran separated by a low divider), and the Minchah is connected above the divider within the Kli, one may do Kemitzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Here, the Minchah is connected. We cannot resolve our question about a disconnected Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Can water join (for Tum'ah) to something joined through a Kli? (If two disconnected parts of a Minchah were in a Kli, and water connected one of them to Kodshim outside the Kli, and a Tevul Yom touched the part outside the water, we know that the other part (in the Kli) is Nifsal. Is it Posel the Kodshim outside the Kli?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps Tziruf Kli takes effect only for what is in the Kli, but not for what is outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since we consider it to be connected, it is connected in every respect!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If you will say that it is connected, can a Kli join something joined through water? (If the Tevul Yom touched the Kodshim outside the Kli, we know that the part (in the Kli) touching the water is Nifsal. Is the other part Nifsal also?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps Tziruf Kli takes effect when Tum'ah touches inside the Kli, but not if it touches outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps it applies in both cases!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SAVA LAH TUM'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If an Isaron was in two parts and one of them became Tamei, and both parts were put in a Kli and a Tevul Yom touched the Tamei part, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do we say Sava Lah Tum'ah (if Tum'ah touches something that was already Tamei, this has no effect, e.g. to be Metamei other Kodesh through Tziruf Kli)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We do not say this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a garment was Tamei Medras (an Av ha'Tum'ah) and it was made into a curtain, it is no longer Tamei Medras, but it is (a Rishon l'Tum'ah,) like a Kli that touched a Medras.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> It did not touch a Medras! However, if a Zav touched it, it is Tamei Maga Zav (like a Kli that touched a Zav, i.e. a Rishon.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Even if the Zav touched it after it was Tamei Medras, it becomes Tamei Maga Zav. We do not say Sava Lah Tum'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Perhaps this is only if the Zav touched it before it was Tamei Medras;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely, if the second Tum'ah (Medras) is more severe than the first, we do not say Sava Lah Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>My question was when both are light Tum'os, perhaps we say Sava Lah Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> R. Yosi admits that if two garments were folded on top of each other and a Zav sat on them, the top garment are Tamei Medras, the bottom is Tamei Medras and Tamei Maga Medras. (Right now, there is no significance to (also) being Maga Medras. However, if it will be was made into a curtain, or be torn to less than the Shi'ur for Tum'as Medras, R. Yosi admits that it will be Maga Medras.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, the Tum'os came at the same time. Rava asked about Tum'os that came one after the other.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AN UNNEEDED PART OF A MINCHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If an Isaron was in two parts and one of them was lost and more flour was separated to replace it and then the lost part was found (either of these may be joined to the intact part to comprise the Minchah), and all three piles of flour are in one Kli:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Tum'ah touches the (previously) lost pile, the intact pile also becomes Tamei due to Tziruf Kli. The replacement pile is Tahor (since it was never intended to be joined to the lost pile);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Tum'ah touches the replacement pile, the intact pile also becomes Tamei. The lost pile is Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If Tum'ah touches the intact pile, the other two piles also become Tamei (since each was intended to be joined to the intact pile);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> In all cases, all of them become Tamei, for all were designated due to the original Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The same applies to Kemitzah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Kemitzah was taken from the lost pile, its Shirayim and the intact pile may be eaten. The replacement pile is forbidden.(It will not be part of the Minchah, therefore the Kometz does not permit it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Kemitzah was taken from the replacement pile, its Shirayim and the intact pile may be eaten. The lost pile is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If it was taken from the intact pile, (its Shirayim may be eaten, but) the other piles are forbidden. (We do not know which of them is part of the Minchah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> In all cases, the other two may not be eaten, for all were designated due to the original Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Do you hold that Shirayim of the intact pile may be eaten? The Kometz was separated for all three piles, (a third of a Kometz from each, instead of half (a Kometz) from each of the two piles comprising the Minchah). A sixth is Chaser from each of them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak brei d'Rav Mesharshiya):</span> How can the Kometz be offered? A third of it is 'Chulin'! (It was for the pile that is not part of the Minchah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (Rav Ashi):</span> The Kometz is taken on behalf of what the Kohen intends for. He intends for one Isaron.</p></div>
