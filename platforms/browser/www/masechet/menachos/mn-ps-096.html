<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>PLACEMENT OF SHTEI HA'LECHEM ON THE SHULCHAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The kneading, Arichah and baking of Chavitei Kohen Gadol is done inside. They are Docheh Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Grinding the wheat and sifting it is not Docheh Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Akiva says, the general rule is, only those things that cannot be done before Shabbos are Docheh Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Everything done to Menachos, (kneading and Arichah) is in a Kli Shares inside. Nothing is done outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Shtei ha'Lechem are seven Tefachim long and four Tefachim wide. The 'horns' (protrusions from the corners) are four Etzba'os;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Lechem ha'Panim is 10 Tefachim long and five Tefachim wide. Its horns are seven Etzba'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, the way to remember is 'ZeDaD-YeHaZ' (the Gematri'a of these letters is 7-4-4, 10-5-7.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Ben Zoma says, "v'Nasata Al ha'Shulchan Lechem Panim Lefanai Tamid" teaches that the bread has Panim (walls; alternatively - corners, i.e. horns.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, the Shulchan is 10 Tefachim long, and five Tefachim wide, just like Lechem ha'Panim. The length of each loaf runs along the width of the Shulchan. The extra two and a half Tefachim on each end of the loaf were (already from when it was formed into a loaf) bent (upwards, leaving five Tefachim in the middle). The loaves exactly cover the width of the Shulchan. (There are two piles, they exactly cover the length of the Shulchan.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Meir says, the Shulchan is 12 Tefachim by six. Lechem ha'Panim is 10 by five. Their length is along the width of the Shulchan, the extra two Tefachim on each end are bent. The loaves exactly cover the width of the Shulchan;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The middle two Tefachim of the (length of the) Shulchan were empty, to allow ventilation lest the bread become moldy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Aba Sha'ul says, the Bazichei Levonah were placed in those two Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> "V'Nasata Al ha'Ma'areches Levonah Zakah" teaches that it must be on the piles of bread!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Aba Sha'ul:</span> It says "v'Alav Mateh Menasheh"! (Clearly, they did not stand on top of Shevet Efrayim. 'Al' merely connotes 'near'.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>There were four golden Snifim, Mefutzalim, to hold the piles, two Snifim for each pile;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>There were 14 poles for each pile (three (or two) between each bread and the one above it), like hollow half-reeds, the arrangement and removal of the poles is not Docheh Shabbos. (Rashi (97a) - even though Ein Shevus b'Mikdash (we do not refrain from Avodah due to Isurim mid'Rabanan), arranging and removing the poles resembles building and destroying, which are mid'Oraisa. Tosfos - this Mishnah was taught at a time when Chachamim were stringent and forbade almost all Kelim due to Muktzeh.  In some cases, Yesh Shevus b'Mikdash.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, on Erev Shabbos the poles are removed from the breads, the poles (Rashba - the breads) are left (Tosfos - on the floor) along the length of the Shulchan. (On Motzei Shabbos the poles are inserted between the new breads.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>All Kelim in the Mikdash are placed lengthwise towards the length of the Mikdash (east-west).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> Everything done to Menachos is done in a Kli Shares inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> "...Ha'Makom Asher Yevashlu Sham ha'Kohanim Es ha'Asham v'Es ha'Chatas Asher Yofu Es ha'Minchah l'Vilti Hotzi El he'Chatzer ha'Chitzonah" equates Minchah to Asham and Chatas. Just like they must be cooked in Klei Shares, also Minchah (must be baked in a Kli Shares).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SHULCHAN IS MEKADESH ITS AIRSPACE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> The Shulchan is 10 Tefachim long...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> According to R. Yehudah, each loaf is folded up two and a half Tefachim, so the Shulchan is Mekadesh 15 Tefachim above its surface (the height of the six loaves in each pile). According to R. Meir, each loaf is folded up two Tefachim. The Shulchan is Mekadesh 12 Tefachim above its surface. (It is not Mekadesh them to be offered, only to become Nifsalim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The top bread is higher than this. He did not account for the height of the poles (which separate between the breads)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are indentations in the bread into which the poles fit. They do not raise the bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The sole purpose of the poles is to allow ventilation, lest the bread become moldy. If there is no space between the breads, they will become moldy!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They raise the bread a small amount.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In any case, why does R. Yochanan ignore that small amount?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the (five) spaces between the breads add up to less than a Tefach, he did not bother to mention it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Shulchan is Mekadesh also the Bazichim. They rest on the top bread. This is more than 15 (or 12) Tefachim above the Shulchan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Bazichim rest inside the bread. They are not on top of it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There were corners on top of the bread. This adds to the height!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The corners do not point upwards, rather, inwards. The bread above it rests on them. (Really, just above them. We said that the poles separate the breads slightly.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">96b----------------------------------------96b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The breads rest on the Misgeret (rim) around the Shulchan. This adds to the height!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Yochanan's teaching is like the opinion that the rim is below (the top surface of the Shulchan);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> According to the opinion that the rim is above, it slopes outward, so the bread rests on the Shulchan itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>Tana'im argue about where the rim was;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> There were no Snifin (Sefas Emes - i.e. they were distanced from the Shulchan). The rim (above) holds the (bottom) bread in place.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The rim was below.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A REVERSIBLE TABLETOP</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Chachamim hold that the rim was below. We learn from this that a reversible table (it may be flipped over and used) is Tamei (i.e. Mekabel Tum'ah. Rashi - normally, Klei Etz (wooden Kelim) without an interior are Tehorim. The Shulchan is wide, so it is fitting for Medras (to sit or lie on), therefore it is Tamei. Tosfos - since a table services people and Kelim, it is Tamei);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>According to R. Yosi, the rim was above. We cannot learn the law of a reversible table (from the Shulchan, for it had an interior).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that the Shulchan is Mekabel Tum'ah. It is a Kli Etz made to be stationary. Such Kelim are Tehorim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah equates them to Sak (a Kli \of sackcloth, which is Mekabel Tum'ah). Just like Sak is moved when empty and full, also wooden Kelim are Tamei only if they are moved when empty and full.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish teaches that the Shulchan is moved even when it is full:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Al ha'Shulchan ha'Tahor"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (It is Tamei because it is moved.) This teaches that they would hold up the Shulchan during the festivals, when everyone comes to the Mikdash, and say 'see your dearness to Hash-m!'</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> A great miracle was done with Lechem ha'Panim. It was as warm (or fresh) when taken off the Shulchan as it was when placed on it a week earlier - "Lashum Lechem Chom b'Yom Chilakcho."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Tum'ah of the Shulchan depend on being moved? It is covered with gold!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a table or a leather covered chair caved in or was covered with stone (which is not Mekabel Tum'ah), it is Tamei only if there remains an intact place (not covered by stone) to hold cups;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it is Tamei if there remains a place to hold pieces (of bread or meat. This shows that the Kli has the law of the covering. Metal Kelim, even if there stationary, are Tamei!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Kli gets the law of the covering only if the covering is nailed on. (The gold was not nailed onto the Shulchan.)</p></div>
