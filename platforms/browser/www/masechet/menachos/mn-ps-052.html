<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ME'ILAH WITH THE ASHES OF PARAH ADUMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> There were two enactments:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mid'Oraisa, Me'ilah applies to Parah, but not to its ashes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>People treated the ashes lightly, and used them to cure wounds, so Chachamim decreed Me'ilah on the ashes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They saw that people refrained from being sprinkled on (with water with the ashes) in cases of Safek Tum'as Mes (out of fear of transgressing Me'ilah), Chachamim reverted to Torah law.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE PURCHASE OF THE PAR HE'ELAM DAVAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Yehudah):</span> If (most of Yisrael transgressed due to a mistaken Hora'ah of the Great Sanhedrin, so) we must bring Par He'elam Davar (and for idolatry, Se'iri Avodah Zarah), we collect money to buy it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon says, it is bought from Shekalim in Terumas ha'Lishkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> R. Shimon says that we collect money. R. Yehudah says that it comes from Terumas ha'Lishkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Beraisa is later (after they retracted? We rely on the latter.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabanan):</span> Presumably, Beraisa #1 is more authoritative, for we know that R. Shimon is concerned for negligence (e.g. of heirs of the Kohen Gadol).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> Perhaps Beraisa #2 is more authoritative. I.e. R. Shimon is (normally) concerned for negligence, but not regarding things brought for atonement!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah Zuti - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> "Es Korbani Lachmi l'Ishai Re'ach Nichochi Tishmeru Lehakriv Li b'Moado" - the extra words include Par He'elam Davar and Se'iri Avodah Zarah, that they come from Terumas ha'Lishkah. (Since he expounds a verse, presumably this was his final opinion, like Beraisa #1.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OFFERING CHAVITIM WITH A FULL ISARON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The full amount was offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Was the full amount offered in the morning and again in the afternoon, or only in the morning, and nothing was offered in the afternoon?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Mishnah):</span> The eighth (Kohen selected in the lottery) offered the Chavitim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(We learned that 13 Kohanim engaged in the morning Tamid, and 13 in the afternoon Tamid.) If it is not offered in the afternoon, sometimes there are only 12, i.e. when the Kohen died and was not replaced!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yirmeyah - Mishnah):</span> The seventh offered the Soles... the ninth offered the wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to Rava, we should say that also these are offered without fail. However, we know that "Minchasam v'Niskeihem" may be offered that night or the next day!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, we must say that the Mishnah discusses the normal case, it does not mention exceptions;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Likewise, it does not mention when Chavitim are not offered in the afternoon!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> Indeed, I erred.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction of retraction (Rava):</span> My teaching was correct. "Soles Minchas Tamid" teaches that Chavitim are like Minchas Tamid. (They are offered without fail.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Beraisa):</span> The full amount is offered in the morning and in the afternoon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Aba Yosi ben Dostai and Chachamim argue about (the normal Hakravah of) Chavitim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Aba Yosi ben Dostai says, two Kamatzim of Levonah are brought with it, one in the morning and one in the afternoon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, one Kometz is brought, half in the morning and half in the afternoon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do they argue?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Aba Yosi holds that we never find half a Kometz offered. Chachamim hold that we never find two Kamatzim offered for one Isaron.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> According to Chachamim, if the Kohen Gadol died and was not replaced, do we double the Levonah (and offer a full Kometz with the Isaron, morning and afternoon)?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since double the flour is offered, also double the Levonah is offered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps we double only what the Torah explicitly says to double?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> According to everyone, do we double the oil?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur of a Kometz applies to five things...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a full Kometz is offered morning and afternoon, both of these should be counted, and there would be seven!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(Surely, the Mishnah is like Chachamim. Presumably, just like the Levonah is not doubled, also the oil. We have no source that Aba Yosi argues about oil.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Mishnah does not discuss b'Di'eved cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef bar Shemayah):</span> One of the five cases is one who offers a Kometz outside the Mikdash (he is liable), which is b'Di'eved!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions - Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Beraisa):</span> If the Kohen Gadol died and was not replaced, in the morning we offer a full Isaron, a full Kometz, and use half of the three Lugim of oil. We offer the same in the afternoon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it is Chachamim, why is the Levonah doubled, but not the oil?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Aba Yosi, who says that two Kamatzim are always brought with Chavitim. Neither the Levonah nor the oil is doubled.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We have no source that Tana'im argue about oil. Surely, also Chachamim say that it is not doubled, and also Levonah is not doubled.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows Aba Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that the Halachah follows a Stam (unauthored) Mishnah! (The above Mishnah is like Chachamim!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Amora'im argue about what R. Yochanan said. (Really, he said only one of the above two teachings.)</p></div>
<div class="perekline"><p>PEREK KOL HA'MENACHOS</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ALL MENACHOS ARE MATZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Menachos are Matzah, except for the Chametz loaves brought with Todah and Shtei ha'Lechem, which are Chametz;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir says, we take some flour from the Isaron, knead it, and return it to the flour. It becomes Se'or (sourdough) and ferments the rest.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, this is not ideal fermentation. Rather, old (well-fermented) Se'or is put into the measuring Kli, and flour is added to complete the Isaron.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If so, there will be too much or too little flour!</p></div>
