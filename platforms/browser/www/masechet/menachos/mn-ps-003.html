<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SHOULD R. SHIMON VALIDATE OTHER CASES AS WELL?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If Haza'ah of Chatas ha'Of was done below l'Shem Olas ha'Of, Teratzeh, for the Lo Lishmah is evident; for only Mitzuy is done regarding Olah, and that is done above!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this is correct. It is fully Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon said that Menachos are unlike Zevachim. He did not say that they are unlike birds (for also birds Lo Lishmah are Meratzeh sometimes).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> If Kodshei Kodoshim were slaughtered in the north l'Shem Kodshim Kalim, Teratzu, for the Lo Lishmah is evident. One would not slaughter Kodshim Kalim in the north (Tosfos - lest they be confused with Kodshei Kodoshim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. The Torah permits Shechitah of Kodshim Kalim in the entire Azarah. (Often they are slaughtered in the north. We are not concerned for confusion.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kodshim Kalim are slaughtered anywhere in the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #5:</span> If Kodshim Kalim were slaughtered in the south l'Shem Kodshei Kodoshim, Teratzu, for the Lo Lishmah is evident. One may not slaughter Kodshei Kodoshim in the south!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, perhaps they are Kodshei Kodoshim, and he transgressed! (Rashba - this is no less reasonable than saying that he transgressed by slaughtering Lo Lishmah.) The Lo Lishmah is not evident.. (Tosfos - this is also a second answer to the previous questions.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the same applies to Kemitzas Minchas Machavas l'Shem Marcheshes! Perhaps he vowed to bring Marcheshes, and he transgressed and cooked it in a Machavas! (The Lo Lishmah is not evident.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even if he vowed to bring Marcheshes, once he cooks it in a Machavas, it becomes Minchas Machavas. (Therefore, the Lo Lishmah is evident.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven vowed to bring Marcheshes and he brought Machavas or vice-versa, it is Kosher, but he did not fulfill his vow.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps (flour was in front of him, and) he vowed to bring this in a Marcheshes, and he transgressed and cooked it in a Machavas!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven vowed to bring this in a Marcheshes and he brought Machavas or vice-versa, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>(Since the Minchah cannot be changed, the above answer does not apply. The Lo Lishmah is not evident, perhaps it really is Marcheshes!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is according to Chachamim. R. Shimon argues:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> (It is Kosher.) He even fulfills his vow.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that specifying to bring in a particular Kli has no significance. It does not matter whether he said 'a Minchah' or 'this'. (The vow is only to bring a Minchah. Once he cooks it in a Machavas, it becomes Minchas Machavas, and the Lo Lishmah is evident.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #6:</span> If an Olah was slaughtered l'Shem Chatas, Teratzeh, for the Lo Lishmah is evident. An Olah is male, and a Chatas is female!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, some Chata'os are male, e.g. a Nasi brings a male goat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #6A:</span> If he slaughtered it l'Shem Chatas of a commoner, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #6B:</span> If a Chatas of a commoner was slaughtered l'Shem Olah, Teratzeh, for the Lo Lishmah is evident. An Olah is male, and a Chatas is female!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (and Answer to Questions 6A and 6B):</span> The tail covers the genitals, so the gender is not evident.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This applies to a sheep. How can we answer regarding a goat (which has a short tail)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (or #2, for a goat):</span> People do not pay attention whether an animal is male or female, so the Lo Lishmah is not evident.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #7:</span> If a Pesach was slaughtered l'Shem Asham, Teratzeh, for the Lo Lishmah is evident. A Pesach must be in its first year, and an Asham must be in its second!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Asham of a Nazir or Metzora is a first year animal. (The Lo Lishmah is not evident.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #7A:</span> If a Pesach was slaughtered l'Shem Asham Gezeilos or Asham Me'ilos, Teratzeh, for these Ashamos must be second year animals!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #7B:</span> If an Asham Gezeilos or Asham Me'ilos was slaughtered l'Shem Pesach, Teratzeh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (and Answer to Questions 7A, 7B):</span> People do not always discern whether an animal is in its first or second year, for some first year animals look like second year animals, and vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #8:</span> If a goat was slaughtered l'Shem Asham, Teratzeh, for this is recognizably wrong. An Asham must be a sheep, which has (Tosfos -white) wool, whereas goats have (Tosfos - black) hair!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People will assume that it is a black (Rashba - i.e. shorn) sheep!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #9:</span> If a bull or calf was slaughtered l'Shem Pesach or Asham, Teratzeh, for these Korbanos must be sheep (or a kid, regarding Pesach)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Teratzeh;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon meant that Menachos are unlike most Zevachim (but indeed, sometimes Lo Lishmah is evident in Zevachim. Then they are Kesherim, like Menachos. This is another answer to those questions in which we said that R. Shimon should be Machshir a Zevach Lo Lishmah.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>RAVA'S ANSWER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 4:a, 2b - Rava):</span> R. Shimon is (fully) Machshir only regarding (Kemitzah of) a Minchah l'Shem a different Minchah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Our Mishnah discusses a Minchah l'Shem a Zevach (Rashba - e.g. a Minchas Chotei offered to atone for a rich person who must bring Chatas Behemah for the same transgression). R. Shimon agrees that it is not Meratzeh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Minchah l'Shem a (different) Minchah is Meratzeh. "V'Zos Toras ha'Minchah" - there is one law for all Menachos (offering one l'Shem another is like offering Lishmah);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Minchah l'Shem Zevach is not Meratzeh. The verse does not equate Minchah to Zevach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that R. Shimon is Machshir (l'Shem) Menachos because the Lo Lishmah is evident!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, even though the intent is not evident (that it is Lishmah. Just the contrary, the Lo Lishmah is evident!) they are fully Kosher. We learn from "v'Zos Toras ha'Minchah." (Rava holds that if the Lo Lishmah is evident, this is reason to be Posel, the opposite of Rabah's reasoning.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does he explain 'Menachos are unlike Zevachim (because Shechitah is the same for all of them)'? (Since Lo Lishmah is not evident in a Zevach l'Shem a different Zevach, according to Rava, all the more so they should be Meratzeh!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, even though Shechitah is the same for all Zevachim (so there is no need to decree due to Zevachim Lo Lishmah, one might have thought that they are Meratzeh), "v'Zos Toras ha'Minchah" does not discuss Zevachim (therefore, they are not Meratzeh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rava, a Chatas (brought for eating) Chelev should be Meratzeh, even if it was slaughtered l'Shem a different Chatas, e.g. one brought for eating Dam, for serving idolatry, or of a Nazir or Metzora;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We should learn from "v'Zos Toras ha'Chatas" - there is one law for all Chata'os. (Offering one l'Shem another is like offering Lishmah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, R. Shimon says that Chatas l'Shem another Chatas is Meratzeh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> (Chachamim hold that) Chatas Chelev slaughtered l'Shem Chatas Dam or Chatas idolatry is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it was l'Shem Chatas Nazir or Chatas Metzora - it is Pasul, for these (do not atone. They) are like Olos. (Alternatively, it is Pasul, lest people think that it was l'Shem the Olah that accompanies it, and that one may slaughter Lo Lishmah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Chachamim disqualify in all cases. "V'Shachat Osah l'Chatas" - it must be l'Shem the right Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE THIRD ANSWER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 4:a, 2B - Rav Ashi):</span> R. Shimon is (fully) Machshir only when he said (about a Minchas Machavas) 'l'Shem Marcheshes' (without saying 'Minchah'):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Our Mishnah discusses Machavas l'Shem Marcheshes. His intent is for the Kli, not for a different Minchah. Such intent is meaningless;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa discusses Minchas Machavas l'Shem Minchas Marcheshes. The intent is for the Minchah itself; it is not Meratzeh. (Rashba - the Gemara says that it was truly Minchas Machavas. Had the Kohen said this, the Lo Lishmah would be blatant! Rather, he only said 'l'Shem Minchas Marcheshes'.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that R. Shimon is Machshir because the Lo Lishmah is evident!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, even though the intent (Lishmah) is not evident (rather, the Lo Lishmah is evident), and one might have thought that it is Pasul (it is not, for his intent is for the Kli).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does he explain 'Menachos are unlike Zevachim...'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that even though Shechitah, Kabalah and Zerikah are the same for all Zevachim (so the Lo Lishmah is not evident), intent is Posel, for the intent is in the Shechitah itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If Kemitzah of a Minchah Charevah (without oil) was done l'Shem Blulah (mixed with oil), the intent is (evidently Lo Lishmah and) in the Minchah itself. (He did not mention a Kli!) Why is it Meratzeh?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> His intent is not for a Minchah Blulah, rather, for an unspecified mixed matter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Olah slaughtered l'Shem Shelamim should also be Meratzeh. We should say that his intent is not for Korban Shelamim, rather, just for Shelamim (peaceful relations)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is different. The Korban is called Shelamim. The Minchah is not called (only) Blulah, it is called Blulah ba'Shemen - "v'Chol Minchah Velulah va'Shemen"!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHY EACH DID NOT LEARN LIKE THE OTHERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rava and Rav Ashi did not answer (Question 4:a, Daf 2b) like Rabah, for they hold that there is more reason to disqualify when the Lo Lishmah is evident;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rabah and Rav Ashi did not answer like Rava, for they do not expound "v'Zos Toras ha'Minchah" to teach about a Minchah l'Shem a different Minchah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rabah and Rava did not answer like Rav Ashi, due to Rav Acha's question. (They do not accept Rav Ashi's answer.)</p></div>
