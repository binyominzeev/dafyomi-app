<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DO KORBANOS DUE TO TODAH REQUIRE BREAD?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina citing R. Yochanan):</span> This law (Korbanos due to Todah are offered without bread) applies only after Kaparah (Zerikah of the Todah). If they were offered before Kaparah, they require bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Amram):</span> Which case does he discuss?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He discusses Chalifah of Todas Chovah (one who vowed to bring a Todah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is no Chidush. Our Mishnah explicitly teaches after Kaparah, and the Beraisa teaches before Kaparah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He discusses Chalifah of Todas Nedavah (someone designated an animal to be a Todah)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely, this requires bread even after Kaparah. Since there was no obligation to bring another Korban, surely the Chalifah was Hukdash to be another Todah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He discusses Vlad Todas Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely, this does not require bread even before Kaparah. It is like Mosar Todah (excess money Hukdash for Todah, i.e. a Todah was bought for less than the amount Hukdash for it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> He discusses Vlad Todas Chovah. It requires bread only if it is offered before Kaparah (i.e. before its mother is offered).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan teaches that one may get atonement through Shevach Hekdesh (something that grew from Hekdesh, e.g. a calf).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Abaye asked the same question as Rav Amram, and reached the same conclusion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Also R. Yitzchak bar Yosef taught like R. Chanina and Abaye;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> Chalifas Todas Nedavah requires bread whether it was brought before or after Kaparah. Surely it was Hukdash to be another Todah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Vlad Todas Nedavah does not require bread even before Kaparah. It is like Mosar Todah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Vlad Todas Chovah requires bread only if it is offered before Kaparah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PARALLEL CASES OF TODAH AND CHATAS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Any case in which a Chatas must die (a tradition from Sinai teaches five cases in which it cannot be offered or redeemed), a corresponding case of Todah is offered without bread;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Any case in which a Chatas is Ro'eh, a corresponding case of Todah is offered with bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Amram - Beraisa):</span> What is the source that if a Todah was lost, a replacement was designated, and the Todah was found, either may be offered l'Shem Todah with bread?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says 'ha'Todah Yakriv'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the second animal to be offered also requires bread!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yakrivenu" - only one requires bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Crux of question:</span> The corresponding case of Chatas is Ro'eh (according to Chachamim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Rebbi):</span> If a Chatas was Hukdash and became lost, a replacement was designated, and the Chatas was found, either may be offered, and the other must die;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Chachamim say, the Chatas must die only if it was found after (the replacement was offered for) Kaparah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it was found before Kaparah, it is Ro'eh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Shmuel holds like Rebbi, who says that also in this case the Chatas must die.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Shmuel said that whenever Chatas is Ro'eh, Todah is offered with bread.) According to Rebbi, when is a Chatas Ro'eh?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Ro'eh is the following case:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> If two Chata'os were separated for Acharayus (in case one will be lost, the other will be offered; Tosfos - he did not Makdish both. He said that one is Hekdesh, but he did not specify which), he may offer either one, and the other is Ro'eh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The corresponding case of Todah does not require bread!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Shmuel holds like R. Shimon, who says that five Chata'os must die. (In every case of Chalifah, one is offered and the other dies.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon holds that there is no case of Ro'eh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Shmuel said only that whenever Chatas must die, Todah is offered without bread. (He did not discuss when a Chatas is Ro'eh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He argues with R. Yochanan, who says that one may get atonement through Shevach Hekdesh. (Shmuel teaches that Vlad Todah is offered without bread.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>REPLACING A LOST TODAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> If one said 'this is a Todah, and this is its bread':</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the bread was lost, he brings other bread in its place;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the Todah was lost, he may not bring another Todah with the bread. (The bread must be burned.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The bread is Gelal (due to, i.e. secondary to) the Todah, but not vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If money was Hukdash for Todah and not all was needed, the remainder may be used to buy the bread;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">80b----------------------------------------80b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If money was Hukdash for the bread and some was left over, it may not be used it to buy the Todah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from Rav Kahana's teaching;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana) Question:</span> What is the source that Lachmei Todah are called 'Todah'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Hikriv Al Zevach ha'Todah Chalos Matzos."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should also be permitted to use excess money Hukdash for the bread to buy the Todah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Lachmei Todah are called Todah, but Todah is not called Lechem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a Todah was Hukdash and it was lost, a replacement was Hukdash and lost, and a third animal was Hukdash, and the first two were found (all three are here):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the owner gets Kaparah through the first (offers it first), the second does not require bread. The third requires bread (for it is not Chalifas Todah, rather, it is Chalifas Chalifas Todah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he gets Kaparah through the third, the second does not require bread, but the first requires bread;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he gets Kaparah through the second, the first and third do not require bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> No matter which he offers first, the others do not require bread, for all are Chalifos of each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The same applies to Chata'os. If a Chatas was Hukdash and lost, another was Hukdash and lost, and a third was Hukdash, and the first two were found:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he gets Kaparah through the first (or third), the second must die, the third (or first) is Ro'eh (it is not Chalifas Chatas);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he gets Kaparah through the second, the others must die.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> No matter which he offers, the others must die.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush? (Surely, the same applies to Chatas!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that only regarding Todah two can be offered with bread, for it is possible to be Makdish more Todos, but since one cannot Makdish an extra Chatas, in all cases the others must die. R. Zeira teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>A TODAH MIXED WITH ITS TEMURAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> If a Todah became mixed with its Temurah and one of them died, there is no way to offer the remaining animal:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We cannot offer it with bread, for perhaps it is the Temurah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We cannot offer it without bread, for perhaps it is the Todah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he said "Alai (it is incumbent on me to bring a) Todah", he is obligated to bring another animal and bread. He can stipulate!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He says, if the remaining animal is the Temurah, the new animal is a Todah, and this is its bread;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If the remaining animal is the Todah, the new animal is Acharayus for the Todah (will be offered in place of it if the Todah will be lost.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he said 'this is a Todah.' (There is no Acharayus, so he cannot do like above.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Levi; Tosfos - a different Talmid):</span> Why can't he offer the remaining animal with bread, and stipulate:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If this is the Todah, this is its bread. If not, the bread is Chulin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> One may not bring Chulin into the Azarah.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> One may not cause Kodshim to be wasted. (If the new animal will not be eaten before morning, we will have to burn it, since it is a Safek a Todah. Perhaps it really is a Shelamim, and it should be eaten!) R.
