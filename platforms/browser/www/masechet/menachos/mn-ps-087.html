<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>INFERIOR WINES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> We do not use wine from the top of the barrel, for it contains mold, nor from the bottom, which has dregs. We take only from the middle third (through a spout).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we check (which wine is coming out)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Gizbar sits with a stick in his hand. When the wine coming out turns white (due to dregs), the Gizbar raps with his stick. (Rambam - he pushes away the one collecting it. Rashi - he raps on the barrel, to show that no more should be taken. Rashash - the spout is a third above the bottom of the barrel. There are dregs also above, so whiteness shows that the middle third has already left.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, wine with mold is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>(The source for all the Pesulim of our Perek is) "Temimim Yihyu Lachem u'Minchasam... Temimim Yihyu Lachem v'Niskeihem" (Rashash, based on Rambam (85a). Rashi - this is R. Yosi's source to disqualify moldy wine.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> We do not bring sweet, smoked or cooked wine. If it was brought, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> The Mishnah is Machshir Halistiyon b'Di'eved. Also this is sweet!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> Really, the two clauses go together. (We do not bring from Halistiyon because we do not bring sweet wine. If it was brought, it is Pasul);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Halistiyon is from grapes stricken by the sun. It is not detestable. The Mishnah disqualifies wine that is sweet because the grapes themselves are inferior. This is detestable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Rebbi):</span> We do not bring old wine;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Chachamim permit this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> "La'Keves Yayin" teaches that just like lambs (for Musafim) must be in their first year, also the wine for Nesachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, just like lambs in their second year are Pesulim (for Musafim), we should disqualify wine in its second year!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is true!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> We do not bring wine in its second year. If it was brought it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is like Rebbi, who forbids bringing it, and the Beraisa is Machshir b'Di'eved!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rebbi learns from "Al Tere Yayin Ki Yis'adam." (Wine should be red. After one year, the redness fades.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not use vines supported on poles... (only from worked vineyards).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The vineyards must be worked (digging around the vines) twice a year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>Rav Yosef had a small orchard. He dug around the vines twice a year. It produced (strong) wine proper to be diluted with twice the usual amount of water (six times its own volume, instead of three).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WINE FOR NESACHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not gather the wine in large barrels (rather, in small barrels.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The small barrels are medium-size flasks of Lud.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text):</span> We do not rest two barrels together (lest one spoil and cause the other to spoil), rather, individually.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rambam):</span> We stack barrels in threes (Ri Korkus - side by side; Lechem Mishnah - one on top of the other), but not in stacks of one or two. (We take from the middle barrel. It is less exposed, so  it is preserved best.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> How do we check? The Gizbar sits with a stick, when the wine coming out turns white, he raps his stick.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When wine white from dregs comes out, he raps.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't he tell them to stop taking wine?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This supports R. Yochanan:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Just like speech is good for spices (for the Ketores), it is bad for wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> Wine...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one was Makdish (any) Pasul wine for Nesachim, is he lashed for being Makdish a Ba'al Mum?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since it is Pasul, this is like being Makdish a Ba'al Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps the Lav applies only to animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The best rams come from Mo'av. The best lambs come from Chevron. The best calves come from Sharon. The best birds (for Korbanos, Torim and Bnei Yonah) come from Har ha'Melech;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, we bring lambs that are as wide as their height. (Ben Yehoyada - this is deformed like a midget. It is Pasul! Rather, he means, their obesity causes them to be taller than usual.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Shila):</span> He learns from "Yir'eh Miknecha... Kar Nirchav."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>GUARDIANS OF YERUSHALAYIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "(Hash-m appointed angels to guard Yerushalayim)... Tamid Lo Yecheshu (they are never silent)." What do they say?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar Rav Shila):</span> They say "Atah Sakum Terachem Tziyon."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> They say "Boneh Yerushalayim Hash-m."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did they say before the Churban?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Rav Shila):</span> They said "Ki Vachar Hash-m b'Tziyon Ivah l'Moshav Lo."</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE MEASURES IN THE MIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There were two dry measures in the Mikdash, an Isaron and half-Isaron;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Meir says, there were two one-Isaron measures and and one half-Isaron measure;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Isaron was used to measure the Soles for all Menachos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We do not use a three-Isaron measure for (Minchas Nesachim of) a bull, nor a two-Isaron measure for a ram, Rather, we repeatedly use the Isaron.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The half-Isaron is used to measure the Chavitim. Half (of the Isaron) is brought in the morning, and half in the afternoon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "Isaron Isaron la'Keves ha'Echad" teaches that there were two one-Isaron measures;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One of them held an Isaron Machuk (when it was full and any overflow was wiped away). The other held an Isaron Gadush (heaping).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Gadush Isaron was used for all Menachos, except for Chavitim, for which the Machuk was used.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">87b----------------------------------------87b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Chachamim say, there was only one Isaron - "v'Isaron Echad la'Keves ha'Echad";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what do we learn from "Isaron Isaron"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that there is also a half-Isaron.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's source for a half-Isaron?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from the first 'Vov' in "v'Isaron";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim do not expound this 'Vov'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Meir expound "v'Isaron Echad la'Keves ha'Echad"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that we do not use a three-Isaron measure for a bull, nor a two-Isaron measure for a ram;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Chachamim learn this from a dot over a 'Vov':</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> The dot over the second 'Vov' in 'v'Isaron' in the Musaf of the first day of Sukos teaches that we do not use a three-Isaron measure for a bull, nor a two-Isaron measure for a ram.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir does not expound the dot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The half-Isaron is used to measure the Chavitim...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He (Rashi Kesav Yad - may) measure(s) out a half-Isaron in his house. (It does not say that he divides the Isaron into two halves.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> Chavitim are not brought (to the Mikdash) half at a time. Rather, he brings a full Isaron (of flour) and divides it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Mishnah means that the half-Isaron is used to divide the Chavitim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> According to R. Meir, was the half-Isaron Machuk or Gadush?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Why don't you ask according to Chachamim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rami bar Chama:</span> According to Chachamim, I ask (even) about the Isaron, if it was Machuk or Gadush!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> We can learn about R. Meir from (an explicit teaching of) R. Meir, and from R. Meir we learn to Chachamim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir says that the Machuk Isaron was for Chavitim. Also the half-Isaron is for Chavitim, so presumably it is also Machuk;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Just like R. Meir requires both measures Mechukos (for Chavitim), also Chachamim. (Since there is only one measure of each, they are Mechukos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> Do we divide Chavitim in half by hand, or with a Kli?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> Surely, it is by hand. If a Kli were required (for exactness), a scale would be required (it is most exact!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a scale is required!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One of the curses is that people (will share an oven to save fuel, the bread will break inside, and they) will weigh the (pieces of) bread with a scale (to ensure that each receives the proper amount). This shows that it is improper to do so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>CAN THE SHULCHAN BE MEKADESH KEMATZIM?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If Kematzim (of Levonah, not in Bazichim; alternatively - of Menachos) were placed in the Godesh of the Shulchan (its airspace, i.e. between loaves of Lechem ha'Panim; alternatively - directly on the Shulchan, even though it is not b'Soch (in the interior of) the Shulchan), is this Mekadesh them?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since its Godesh is Mekadesh Lechem ha'Panim, it is Mekadesh also Kematzim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps it is Mekadesh only what should be placed on it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is not Mekadesh them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>(The Shulchan is one Amah wide, Tana'im argue whether this Amah is five or six Tefachim. Each loaf of Lechem ha'Panim is 10 Tefachim long. Its length is centered along the width of the Shulchan, and the excess in each direction is folded up.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that according to the (first) opinion that the last two and a half Tefachim (on each end of) each loaf is folded up, the Shulchan is Mekadesh 15 Tefachim above its surface (the height of the six loaves in each pile). According to the opinion that the ends of each loaf are folded up two Tefachim, it is Mekadesh 12 Tefachim above its surface! (Rashi Kesav Yad - R. Yochanan need not teach that it is Mekadesh the bread. Surely he teaches that it is Mekadesh things not fitting for it!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is not Mekadesh them to be offered (as if they were placed in a Kli Shares), but it is Mekadesh them to be Nifsalim (through a Tevul Yom or through Linah. Alternatively, if a Zar put them there, a Kohen cannot complete the Avodah even if they are returned to the Minchah.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE WET MEASURES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There were seven wet measures in the Mikdash - a Hin (12 Lugim), half-Hin, third-Hin, quarter-Hin, Log, half-Log, and Revi'is (quarter-Log);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Eliezer bar R. Tzadok says, there were notches in the Hin showing the level (of a half, third or quarter-Hin) needed for (oil or wine for) a bull, ram or lamb. (Tosfos, based on Tosefta - this eliminated the need for three Kelim, so there were only four. Rashi - there were notches for all the measures; there was only one Kli.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon says, there was not a Hin. There was no need for it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, there was a measure of a Log and a half, to measure the oil needed for the half of the Chavitim offered in the morning, and for the half offered in the afternoon.</p></div>
