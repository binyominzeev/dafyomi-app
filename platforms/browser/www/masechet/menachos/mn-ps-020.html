<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IS SALT ME'AKEV?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna):</span> The Torah did not repeat salt, yet it is Me'akev!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Bris Melach Olam" - there is a covenant with salt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, it says "Bris Melach Olam", and it says "Bris Kehunas Olam." Just like Korbanos require Kehunah, they require salt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> Rav holds like our Tana, who is Machshir a Korban without salt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, we should similarly be Machshir if Yetzikah was not done at all! (We did not explain the Mishnah (18a) this way!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, (the Mishnah is Machshir when) a Kohen did not do Yetzikah, rather, a Yisrael did.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Similarly, (it is Machshir when) a Kohen did not salt, rather, a Yisrael did.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> A Yisrael may not approach the Mizbe'ach to salt. (Therefore, we must say that it was not salted at all.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (a)):</span> Since it says "Bris", it is as if it was repeated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Salt is repeated - "v'Chol Korban Minchascha ba'Melach Timlach"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is needed for the following teaching:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Had it said 'Korban ba'Melach', one might have thought even wood and blood must be salted, for they are called Korban;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Therefore, it says 'Minchas.' Just like a Minchah requires other things (it must be burned on wood), all Korbanos that require other things must be salted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we include things that permit, like Minchah. This would include blood!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We put salt "me'Al Minchasecha", but not on blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps all of the Minchah must be salted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Korban" - only the part that is a Korban (Huktar) must be salted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches only that the Kometz must be salted. What is the source for Levonah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We include Levonah, for it is in the Kli with the Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to salt the following?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Levonah brought by itself, or in Bazichim (brought with Lechem ha'Panim), Ketores, Minchas Kohanim, Chavitiei Kohen Gadol, Minchas Nesachim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Eimurim of Chatas, Asham and other Kodshei Kodoshim, and of Kodshim Kalim, Ivrei Olah and Olas ha'Of.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Al Kol Korbancha Takriv Melach."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHICH KORBANOS MUST BE SALTED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa includes Levonah because it is in the Kli with the Minchah. We already included Korbanos that require other things! (Levonah must be burned on wood.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa suggested that perhaps we should expound "Korban... Minchah" according to Klal and Prat. From Klal and Prat we include only the Prat, i.e. Minchah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since there is another Klal, "Korbancha", we expound Klal, Prat and Klal, and include everything similar to the Prat, i.e. Korbanos that require other things;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like Minchah requires wood (to burn the Kometz), we include all Korbanos that require wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we say that just like Minchah requires Levonah (to accompany it), we include blood, for Nesachim (wine) accompanies it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Nesachim are considered an accompaniment for Eimurim, not for blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (The Torah discusses 'Achilah' regarding the Mizbe'ach.) Eating and drinking go together.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rather, we should say that wine (which is "Mesame'ach Elokim va'Anashim") accompanies the blood, for after Kaparah (Zerikah), there is Simchah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Nesachim are unlike Levonah. Levonah is in the Kli with the Minchah, but Nesachim are not in the Kli with the blood. (This completes the answer to Question (a). The Beraisa means that we include Korbanos such as Levonah that require other things (wood, to burn it) because it is in the Kli with the Minchah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>However, all Korbanos (that are burned) require wood in the same way.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should include everything similar to the Prat, i.e. Korbanos that require other things and permit?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This would include only Levonah brought in Bazichim, which permits Lechem ha'Panim! (Yad Binyamin - obviously we do not exclude Levonah of a Minchah, which requires wood and permits, for it is in the same Kli with the Minchah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Me'Al Minchasecha" excludes blood. If not for the verse, we would have included it (even though it does not require other things). This shows that we include Korbanos that (resemble the Prat in one way, i.e. they) require other things or permit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Me'Al Minchasecha" excludes blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Why don't we use this to exclude limbs?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to include limbs, for they resemble Minchah in the following ways (the Siman to remember them is AShBaN TaMEi):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They require Acherim (other things), they are burned on the Esh (fire), they are offered only b'Chutz (outside the Heichal), Nosar, Tamei and Me'ilah apply to them (Tosfos - the Gemara omitted the last similarity, that they are Ochel (food).)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is more reasonable to include blood, for it permits and it becomes Pasul at sundown, like a Minchah (the Kometz must be offered before sundown)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are more similarities to limbs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Had it said 'Korban ba'Melach', one might have thought even wood and blood must be salted, for they are called Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Tana is Rebbi, who says that wood is called Korban. Rebbi requires salt!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Korban" teaches that one may bring a Nedavah of wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One must bring at least two large branches - "veha'Goralos Hipalnu Al Korban ha'Etzim".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi says, wood is considered a Korban Minchah. It requires Kemitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> According to Rebbi, a Nedavah of wood requires (must be burned on) other wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must delete 'wood' from the text of the Beraisa.</p></div>
