<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>REAPING BEFORE THE OMER (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> Harvesting before the Omer must be done by hand (without a scythe). This reminds him not to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Granted, this reminds him not to eat while harvesting, but perhaps he will eat while grinding or sifting!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> He must grind with a hand-mill (not with a water-mill), and he turns the sifter upside down when sifting.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> One may harvest Beis ha'Shelachin (a field that must be irrigated) normally. Perhaps he will eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may harvest (before the Omer) Beis ha'Shelachin in (some texts - or) a valley, but one may not make piles of the grain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> People shun Chodosh (it is forbidden from its inception, so we need not decree about it). They do not shun Chametz (it is permitted all year).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Indeed, you answer the contradiction in R. Yehudah. However, also Chachamim contradict themselves! (They are concerned about Chodosh, but not about Chametz!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Chachamim do not decree about Chametz. Since he searches in order to burn it, we are not concerned lest he eat (if he finds)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (for R. Yehudah - Rav Ashi):</span> R. Yehudah permits preparing parched flour. (It is hard, so it is not normally eaten.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is wrong! Granted, we are not concerned lest one eat parched flour. However, perhaps he will eat before it is parched!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we are not concerned because he must harvest by hand, like Rabah answered!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One may harvest Beis ha'Shelachin normally. Perhaps he will eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Rav Ashi is refuted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN IS CHODOSH PERMITTED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> From when the Omer is offered, Chodosh is permitted immediately;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>People far from the Mikdash (who do not know when it is offered) are permitted after midday.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>After the Churban, R. Yochanan ben Zakai enacted to forbid Chodosh the entire day of the 16th.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> It is forbidden mid'Oraisa - "Ad Etzem ha'Yom ha'Zeh"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>People far away are permitted after midday because Beis Din (of Kohanim) is not lazy. (Surely, they offered it by then.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav and Shmuel):</span> When the Mikdash stands, the Omer permits Chodosh. When there is no Mikdash, daybreak (normally, this means dawn; Rashi - sunrise) of the 16th permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - Contradiction:</span> It says "(Chodosh may not be eaten) Ad Havi'achem", and it says "Ad Etzem ha'Yom ha'Zeh"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> When the Mikdash stands, the Omer permits. When there is no Mikdash, the day itself permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> Even when the Mikdash stands, daybreak of the 16th permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Ad Havi'achem"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, there is a Mitzvah (Tosfos - an Aseh; Shitah Mekubetzes (and Tosfos 2b) say that it is not even an Aseh) to wait until bringing the Omer, but there is no Lav after daybreak.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN IS CHODOSH PERMITTED (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Mishnah):</span> From when the Omer is offered, Chodosh is permitted immediately. (These questions are also against R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Then it is l'Chatchilah to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Mishnah):</span> The Omer permits people (to eat Chodosh). Shtei ha'Lechem permits in the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Then it is l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">68b----------------------------------------68b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> After the Churban, R. Yochanan ben Zakai enacted to forbid the entire day of the 16th;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mikdash will be rebuilt soon! (If we would not enact,) people would remember that the previous year they ate Chodosh in the morning of the 16th (and assume that this is permitted also this year);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>They will not know that daybreak of the 16th permitted last year because the Omer was not offered, this year it will be offered, so the Omer will permit!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If there were no Lav to eat (after daybreak) before the Omer, we would not decree, even if it is a Mitzvah to wait!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Yochanan ben Zakai holds like R. Yehudah, who expounds "Ad Etzem ha'Yom ha'Zeh" - (after the Churban, it is forbidden) until the day itself;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds Ad v'Ad Bichlal ("Ad" means 'up to and including'; also the day itself is forbidden);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah argues with R. Yochanan ben Zakai!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> After the Churban, R. Yochanan ben Zakai enacted to forbid Chodosh the entire day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> It is forbidden mid'Oraisa - "Ad Etzem ha'Yom ha'Zeh"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah said this because he mistakenly thought that R. Yochanan ben Zakai forbids mid'Rabanan. Really, R. Yochanan agrees that it is forbidden mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that he enacted to forbid the day!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, he expounded and taught this to people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua would eat Chodosh on the night after the 16th (all the Amora'im mentioned here were in Bavel);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They hold that Chodosh is only mid'Rabanan in Chutz la'Aretz, therefore we are lenient when in doubt (perhaps Kidush ha'Chodesh was a day later than expected. This is why we keep two days of Yom Tov in Chutz la'Aretz.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Rabanan of Rav Ashi's academy would eat Chodosh on the morning of the 17th;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They hold that Chodosh is mid'Oraisa in Chutz la'Aretz. (We are stringent, for perhaps what we call '16th' was really the 15th), and that R. Yochanan ben Zakai's enactment was mid'Rabanan;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The enactment applies only to the 16th, but not to the 17th, which is kept due to doubt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Ravina's father would not eat until the night after the 17th;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He is stringent about the doubt of the day, and he holds like R. Yehudah (who forbids the entire day of the 16th mid'Oraisa).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE OMER AND SHTEI HA'LECHEM PERMIT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Omer permits people. Shtei ha'Lechem permits in the Mikdash;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We may not bring (Chodosh) Menachos, Bikurim or Minchas Nesachim before the Omer. If it was brought, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We may not bring any of them (after the Omer but) before Shtei ha'Lechem. If it was brought, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Tarfon) Question:</span> Why is the law different if he brought before or after the Omer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Yehudah ben Nechemyah):</span> Before the Omer, its prohibition to people was not permitted. After the Omer, this was permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Tarfon was silent. Yehudah's face beamed. (Rashba - R. Tarfon had assumed that the Isur of Chodosh in the Mikdash before Shtei ha'Lechem is unrelated to the Isur of Chodosh to people before the Omer. Tosfos Yom Tov - the Rambam understands that R. Tarfon did not agree with Yehudah's answer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Are you happy that you outsmarted the Chacham?! I will be amazed if you live a long time!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah bar Ilai:</span> This occurred two weeks before Pesach. Yehudah died before Shavu'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> According to Yehudah, if Nesachim of Bikurim (i.e. Chodosh wine; Tosfos Yom Tov - Nesachim (of Chodosh) or Bikurim) were offered before the Omer, they are Kesherim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>One might have thought that grain was Hutar mi'Klalo (forbidden and then permitted), but wine (or Bikurim) was not Hutar mi'Klalo. Rav Nachman teaches that all the more so it is Kosher, for it was never forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> Does Shtei ha'Lechem permit out of order?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (In this order,) grain was planted after the Omer, Shtei ha'Lechem was brought on Shavu'os, and the Omer was brought the next year;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Perhaps Shtei ha'Lechem permits Chodosh (in the Mikdash) only when it is in order (the Omer already permitted the grain to people);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, perhaps it permits even out of order!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah - Beraisa):</span> "V'Im Takriv Minchas Bikurim (...Aviv Kaluy)" refers to the Omer. It is brought from barley;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is brought from wheat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (R. Eliezer):</span> It says here "Aviv", the name the Torah calls the month of leaving Miztrayim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like Aviv of Mitzrayim refers to (Nisan, the time to harvest) barley, also Aviv of the Omer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (R. Akiva):</span> Individuals bring obligatory Menachos of wheat (Minchas Chotei) and of barley (Minchas Sotah). The Tzibur brings Menachos of wheat (e.g. Shtei ha'Lechem) and of barley;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the Omer were from wheat, the Tzibur would never bring barley.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #3 (R. Akiva):</span> If the Omer were from wheat, Shtei ha'Lechem would not be Bikurim (the first of its species. The Torah calls it Bikurim!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> If Shtei ha'Lechem permits out of order, it would be possible for Shtei ha'Lechem to be Bikurim even if the Omer was wheat:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Omer could be brought from wheat that took root last year between the Omer and Shtei ha'Lechem, and Shtei ha'Lechem (this year) will be brought from wheat that took root after last year's Shtei ha'Lechem and before this year's Omer! (This is called Bikurim, for it is the first Korban permitted by this year's Shtei ha'Lechem. Last year's Shtei ha'Lechem permitted this year's Omer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We do not call something 'Bikurim' because it is the first permitted by Shtei ha'Lechem. Rather, it must be the first of its species brought in the Mikdash from the new produce. (Therefore, the Omer must be barley.)</p></div>
