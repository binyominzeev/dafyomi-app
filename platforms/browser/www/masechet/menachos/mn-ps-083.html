<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>KODSHEI KODOSHIM ARE EQUATED TO EACH OTHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of R. Eliezer's teaching):</span> Just like only male Kohanim eat Minchah, the same applies to all these Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Korbanos do we learn from this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn about Chatas and Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Another verse explicitly teaches about them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn about Shalmei Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another verse teaches about them!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "B'Kodesh ha'Kodoshim Tochalenu Kol Zachar Yochal Oso" teaches that only male Kohanim eat Shalmei Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about the source of this. Some learn from "b'Kodesh ha'Kodoshim..." R. Eliezer learns from the Hekesh to Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Just like absorptions of Chatas forbid (if a food absorbs from Chatas, it has all the restrictions of the Chatas), also all Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Just like there is no Kedushah to a fetus or fetal sac inside an Asham (it is male, so it cannot have a fetus or fetal sac inside), there is no Kedushah to a fetus or fetal sac inside any Korban;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer holds that the child of a Korban is not Kodesh until it is born, and that we learn possible from impossible.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Just like Nosar meat of Milu'im must be burned, but not Mosar (live) animals, the same applies to all Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Just like (intent Chutz li'Zmano in) Shelamim can be Mefagel (its Nesachim) and it can become Pigul, the same applies to all Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "Zos ha'Torah..." teaches that just like absorptions of Minchah forbid, also all Korbanos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah needed to teach about absorptions of Chatas and of Minchah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Had it taught only about Minchah, one might have thought that only Minchah forbids, for it is soft, and it is easily absorbed;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Had it taught only about Chatas, one might have thought only Chatas forbids, for fatty meat penetrates deeply.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Just like Chatas must be brought from Chulin money, during the day, and using the right hand (for Zerikah), also all Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Chatas must be from Chulin?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> "V'Hikriv Aharon Es Par ha'Chatas Asher Lo" teaches that it must be his. It cannot be from Ma'aser. (This refers to Par Yom Kipur. All Chata'os have the same law.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "B'Yom Tzavoso..." teaches that all Korbanos must be brought during the day!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we do not learn this from Chatas. It was taught for no reason.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn the right hand from Rabah bar bar Chanah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Whenever it says 'Etzba' or 'Kehunah' (by itself), this teaches that the right hand is required. (Regarding every Korban, it says 'Kohen'!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we do not learn this from Chatas. It was taught for no reason.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Just like bones of Asham are permitted, also bones of all Korbanos, (The Torah permitted all the meat (except for the Eimurim) to Kohanim, and Nosar does not apply to the bones. Alternatively, we learn from "Lo Yihyeh".)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Akiva learn from "v'Zavachta Pesach"? (He does not need it to teach that Pesach comes from Chulin, like R. Eliezer did.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">83b----------------------------------------83b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns Rav Nachman's law;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Mosar Pesach (money Hukdash for Pesach that was not needed; alternatively, Chalifas Pesach) is offered like a Shelamim - "v'Zavachta Pesach...Tzon u'Vakar";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Korban Pesach cannot be Bakar (cattle), only a lamb or goat!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it teaches that Mosar Pesach becomes a Korban that can be (any, i.e. male or female) cattle or flock, i.e. Shelamim (Rashi in Zevachim; Rashi Kesav Yad - Pesach was Hukdash to be eaten, so its Mosar does not become an Olah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Shmuel's father gave a different source for this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel's father):</span> "V'Im Min ha'Tzon" teaches that (Mosar of) something brought from Tzon (i.e. Pesach) is Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> There is a third source for this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Keves" includes the tail of a lamb that is a Pesach. (It is considered Eimurim, so it is Huktar);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Im Kesev" includes a Pesach above one year and a Shelamim that comes due to Pesach (Rashi - Mosar Pesach; Rashi Kesav Yad - the Chagigah of Erev Pesach, for satiation before eating the Pesach; Tosfos - Temuras Pesach);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>These are like Shelamim in all respects, i.e. they require Semichah, Nesachim and Tenufah of the chest and foreleg.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"V'Im Ez" separates, to teach that the tail of a goat is not part of the Eimurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> There are three verses. They teach about three kinds of Mosar Pesach (all become Shelamim), i.e.:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>After its first year and after Pesach passed (the same applies before Pesach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Within its first year and after Pesach passed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Within its first year before Pesach came (e.g. Chalifas Pesach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>The Torah must teach all three cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only about the first, one might have thought that only then it is Shelamim, because it is totally Pasul for Pesach; but not within its first year after Pesach, for it is still Kosher for Pesach Sheni;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught only about the first two cases, one might have thought that only then it is Shelamim, because it is Pasul for Pesach Rishon; but not within its first year before Pesach, for then it is still Kosher for Pesach Rishon.</p></div>
<div class="perekline"><p>PEREK KOL KORBANOS HA'TZIBUR</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE GRAIN USED FOR MENACHOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All (Menachos of) Korbanos Tzibur may come from Eretz Yisrael or Chutz la'Aretz and from Chodosh or Yashan, except for the Omer and Shtei ha'Lechem, which must come from Chodosh of Eretz Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>All Menachos must come from choice grain;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The best places for Soles are Machnis and Zatcha. Next best is Aforayim in the valley.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>All places in Eretz Yisrael are Kesherim, they would bring from here, for these are the best.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Our Mishnah is unlike the following Tana:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the Omer or Shtei ha'Lechem was brought from Yashan, it is Kosher, but a Mitzvah was lost;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding the Omer it says "Takriv Es Minchas Bikurecha" - even from the attic (Yashan, not harvested for the sake of the Omer);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Regarding Shtei ha'Lechem it says "mi'Moshvoseichem Tavi'u", but not from Chutz la'Aretz. We bring "mi'Moshvoseichem" - even from the attic.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot expound two laws from one word!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The latter law is learned from "Tavi'u". (This is extra, for before this it says "v'Hikravtem".)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We used "Tavi'u" to teach that whatever you bring similar to this (i.e. Chametz, in Todah) should be the same size, one Isaron per loaf!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said 'Tavi'. Rather, it says "Tavi'u", to teach also about Lachmei Todah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Regarding both of them) it says "Reishis"! (We should require Chadash!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is l'Chatchilah. B'Di'eved, Yashan is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Regarding Shtei ha'Lechem) it says "Chadashah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Noson and R. Akiva):</span> Shtei ha'Lechem from Yashan is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>To fulfill "Chadashah", it must precede all Menachos of Chodosh.</p></div>
