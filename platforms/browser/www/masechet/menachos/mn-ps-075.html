<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Rebbi):</span> Belilah is done after the Minchah is baked into Chalos. Chachamim say, it is while it is Soles.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Soles Belulah" teaches that Belilah is done while it is Soles;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi says, Belilah is done when it is Chalos - "Chalos (Matzos) Belulos."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Regarding Lachmei Todah it also says "Chalos Belulos", even though Belilah cannot be done when they are Chalos. It must be while it is Soles!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>First oil is put in the Kli, then the Soles, and then more oil. We mix, knead, bake them, break up the Chalos and put on oil (Yetzikah), and do Kemitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rebbi says, Belilah is done when they are Chalos;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Oil is put in the Kli, and then the Soles. We knead, bake them, break up the Chalos and put on oil, mix, put on more oil, and do Kemitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim say that it is impossible to do Belilah with Chalos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> Only a quarter (Rashi Kesav Yad - of the half-Log for all the Lachmei Todah; Rashi - a quarter Log) of oil is not enough to mix with the Chalos Matzos. (They are made from over three Esronim of Soles, about 100 times the volume of the oil. Baked Chalos are dry and absorb much oil.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chalos require Belilah. Rekikim require Meshichah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chalos require Belilah. Rekikim do not require Belilah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that Rekikim require Belilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Chalos do not require Meshichah, yet they require Belilah. Rekikim require Meshichah, all the more so they should require Belilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Chalos (are) Belulos", but Rekikim are not Belulos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Rekikim require Meshichah. Chalos do not require Meshichah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that Chalos require Meshichah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rekikim do not require Belilah, yet they require Meshichah. Chalos require Belilah, all the more so they should require Meshichah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Rekikim (are) Meshuchos", but Chalos are not Meshuchos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does "Chalos Belulos" teach that Rekikim are not Belulos, and how does "Rekikim Meshuchos" teach that Chalos are not Meshuchos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> In many places the Torah says "Chalos Belulos" and "Rekikim Meshuchos." If Rekikim required Belilah (or if Chalos required Meshichah), at least once the Torah should have said 'Rekikim Belulos' (or 'Chalos Meshuchos').</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Meshichah is done like 'Chai'. The rest of the oil is eaten...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of  like 'Chai'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like the Greek letter 'Chai' ('X'; Tosfos brings other opinions).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Minchah is half Rekikim and half Chalos (R. Shimon (63a) permits this), one brings a Log of oil. Half is mixed with the Chalos, and half is used for Meshichah of the Rekikim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Meshichah is done on the entire Rekikim. The leftover oil is added to the oil used for the Chalos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Yehudah citing R. Shimon says, Meshichah is like 'Chai'. The leftover oil is eaten by Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Minchah is entirely Rekikim, one brings a Log of oil. He keeps doing Meshichah until all the oil is consumed;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Yehudah citing R. Shimon says, Meshichah is like 'Chai'. The rest is eaten by Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHICH MENACHOS REQUIRE PETISAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Menachos that are made in a Kli require Petisah (breaking it into pieces).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does 'made in a Kli' exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It excludes Shtei ha'Lechem and Lechem ha'Panim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Pasos Osah Pitim... Minchah" includes all Menachos for the law of Petisah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we include even Shtei ha'Lechem and Lechem ha'Panim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Osah". (Only it requires Petisah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>"V'Yatzakta (Aleha) Shemen Minchah" include all Menachos for the law of Yetzikah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we include Ma'afe Tanur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Aleha" (only on it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we exclude only (one kind of Ma'afe Tanur, e.g.) Rekikim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Hi" is another exclusion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know to exclude Ma'afe Tanur? Perhaps we exclude Minchas Kohanim instead!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">75b----------------------------------------75b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> One exclusion would suffice for Minchas Kohanim. Since there are two, we use them for the two kinds of Ma'afe Tanur.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>PETISAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> To do Petisah of Minchas Yisrael, each Chalah is folded into two, then into four, and it is broken (into four parts);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Minchas Kohen is folded into two and then four, but it is not broken.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chavitei Kohen Gadol are not folded.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Shimon says, Petisah does not apply to Minchas Kohanim and Chavitim, for Kemitzah is not done;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Whenever there is no Kemitzah, there is no Petisah. (Rashba - R. Shimon expounds based on reasoning. Petisah is only for the sake of Kemitzah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Petisah of any Minchah is until the pieces are the size of olives.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Pasos" teaches that each Chalah is broken into only two pieces!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Pitim" (teaches another two).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Pitim" teaches that it should be crumbled!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Osah" teaches that it (a Chalah) is broken into pieces, but the pieces are not broken into pieces!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> It is folded into two, then into four, and it is broken.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> Minchas Kohen and Chavitim are folded...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> Chavitim are not folded.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution (Rava):</span> They are folded in half, but they are not folded into four.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Petisah does not apply to Minchas Kohanim and Chavitim...</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>BREAD CRUMBS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If Chavitza (Rashi - a food cooked with bread crumbs; Tosfos - bread crumbs stuck together via a liquid) contains pieces the size of an olive, its Berachah is ha'Motzi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If all the pieces are less than a k'Zayis, one blesses Borei Minei Mezonos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I learn from a Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen (Rashi Kesav Yad - Yisrael) was offering a Minchah for the first time (in his life; alternatively, the first time this year, i.e. from Chodosh), he blesses Shehecheyanu;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he eats it, he blesses ha'Motzi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Petisah of any Minchah is until the pieces are the size of olives.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael says that they are broken very finely, like flour. Surely, Kohanim would bless ha'Motzi!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they do not bless ha'Motzi!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa #1):</span> If one gathered (altogether) a k'Zayis of bread crumbs (Tosfos - of the five grains) and ate it (on Pesach):</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If they are Matzah, he is Yotzei (to eat Lechem Oni on the first night);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If they are Chametz, he is Chayav Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, he combined them into one mass.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> This is when he ate them within Kdei Achilas Pras (the time to eat half a loaf).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he combined them into one mass, it should say 'ate it'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, (a k'Zayis of) the loaf (from which the crumbs came) is still intact. (Since it retains its importance and its Berachah, its crumbs retain their Berachah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> (One blesses ha'Motzi) even on crumbs less than a k'Zayis.</p></div>
