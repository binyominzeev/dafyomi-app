<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>INFERIOR OILS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not bring from Beis ha'Zevalim...(or from Anfeknon. If it was used, it is Kosher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> We do not bring from Anfeknon. If it was used, it is Pasul, for it is juice. It is not considered oil. (Rashi Kesav Yad - also the Mishnah is Posel, but it considers it to be oil.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Shimon bar Rebbi. The Beraisa is like R. Chiya;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Chiya would not eat oil of Anfeknon (he did not consider it to be oil. Tosfos - he would not throw it out, for it is useful for anointing.) R. Shimon bar Rebbi would dip vegetables in it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A way to remember the opinions is that the rich (R. Shimon, the son of the Nasi) economize.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span>  (Candidates to replace Vashti would be beautified) "Shishah Chodoshim <i>b'Shemen ha'Mor</i>." What is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna bar Chiya):</span> It is balsam oil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> It is oil of olives that did not reach one-third growth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Anfeknon is oil of olives that did not reach one-third growth;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>People use it to remove hair and freshen the skin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not bring from soaked olives...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not bring olive oil that was pickled or cooked, or made from dregs or that has a bad smell. If it was brought, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one was Makdish such oil, is he lashed for being Makdish a Ba'al Mum?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since it is Pasul, this is like being Makdish a Ba'al Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps the Lav applies only to animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF OIL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are three grades of (ripeness of) olives (Rashi Kesav Yad - they are harvested at three times). Three oils come from each of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Grade A olives are those taken from the top of the tree (they get much sun and ripen well).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>For the first oil (of Grade A), the olives are crushed and put into a basket. (The clear oil flows outside the basket. The dregs and waste remain inside);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi Kesav Yad):</span> R. Yehudah says, the crushed olives are placed (in the basket, along the circumference) on the walls. (The oil drips down the walls, and impurities stick to the walls. Clear oil falls to the bottom and is strained through the bottom.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Gershom):</span> R. Yehudah says, the crushed olives are placed on the brim of the basket. (The oil drips down the walls, and impurities stick to the walls.) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>For the second oil, a beam is put on the olives to press them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, rocks are put on them to press them (a beam would cause dregs to come out).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>For the third oil, the olives are ground in a grinder and pressed with a beam.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The first oil is Kosher for the Menorah. The others are Kosher for Menachos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Grade B olives are taken individually from roof height (these get less sun and do not ripen so well - Rashi; Rashi Kesav Yad - they are harvested while standing on the roof, near the trees. Rambam - assorted olives are put on the roof, and selected).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The three oils of Grade B (and also of Grade C below) are made just like those of Grade A, the first (of each) is Kosher for the Menorah. The others are Kosher for Menachos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Grade C are the lowest olives on the tree. They are stored in a bucket in the olivepress until they are stricken (the peel softens and they change color), and they are put on the roof to dry (from sap that exuded.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (Regarding Grade A) does the Mishnah say, 'Megargero' (he picks out the ripe Gargarim (individual olives); alternatively, each Gargir is left until it is ripe), or 'Megalgelo' (he tarries until it ripens nicely)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Shemen Zayis" connotes from the olive. It should stay on the tree until it is full of oil (it exudes without pressing);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This teaches that for Grade A, we are <i>Megalgel</i> olives on the tree. They are gathered into the olivepress ground in a grinder and placed in baskets;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The first oil is what exudes by itself. The second oil comes through pressing with a beam. The third comes after regrinding and pressing with a beam.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The first is Kosher for the Menorah, and the others are Kosher for Menachos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The same applies to Grade B olives;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Grade C olives are stored in a bucket in the olivepress until they are stricken. They are put on the roof to dry like figs (Rashi Kesav Yad - they are piled in a fig-shaped mound). When they are dry they are returned to the olivepress;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The three oils are then obtained just like from Grade A or B olives.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The first is Kosher for the Menorah, and the others are Kosher for Menachos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, olives (for the first oil) are not ground in a grinder. Rather, they are crushed in a mortar. Rocks are used to press (the second and third oils), and not a beam. They are not placed in the basket, rather, on the walls (or brim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana of our Mishnah says that olives (for the first oil) are not ground, rather, crushed. This is like R. Yehudah (in the Beraisa);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He also says that they are placed in the basket (like the first Tana)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana holds like R. Yehudah regarding crushing, but not regarding baskets.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The highest quality oil is the first of Grade A; the second of Grade A and the first of Grade B are equal (they are next best); the third of Grade A, the second of Grade B and the first of Grade C are equal; the third of Grade B and the second of Grade C are equal; the third of Grade C is the lowest quality there is.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should have taught that Menachos require "Shemen Zayis Zach" (clear oil, not from ground olives)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Oil for the Menorah is not called 'Achilah', yet it requires Shemen Zayis Zach. (Partial or total) Haktarah of Menachos is called 'Achilah'. All the more so it should require Shemen Zayis Zach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We require "Zach Kasis" (clear and crushed, and (not ground) "la'Ma'or" (for light, i.e. the Menorah), but not for Menachos.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">86b----------------------------------------86b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How can the Mishnah equate second oil of Grade A and first of Grade B? Only first oil is Kosher for the Menorah. Second oil is Kosher only for Menachos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It means that they are equal for Menachos. (It is a Mitzvah to use choice oil. Both of them are the same quality.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OIL FOR THE <i>MENORAH</i> AND FOR <i>MENACHOS</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should have taught...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Zach" means clean;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, "Kasis" means crushed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Zach Kasis is Pasul for Menachos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "v'Isaron Soles Balul b'Shemen Kasis."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "(Zach Kasis) la'Ma'or"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is in order to save (Menachos do not <i>require</i> first oil).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this a concern?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> The Torah is concerned for the money of Yisrael. (Much oil is used for Menachos. If all were Zach Kasis, it would be expensive. Only three and a half Lugim are used each day for the Menorah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> (Hash-m said) "Tzav Es Bnei Yisrael va'Yikchu Elecha Shemen Zayis Zach." The light is for you (Yisrael, to show your dearness to Me), and not for Me. I do not need it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Zerika):</span> The Shulchan is in the north, and the Menorah is in the south (and the Mizbe'ach is in between). This emphasizes that Hash-m does not need to eat the Korbanos, nor does He need the light (to illuminate on His table.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Va'Ya'aseh la'Bayis Chalonei Shekufim Atumim" - the windows (openings in the walls) of the Heichal were thinner on the inside than the outside. If Hash-m wanted light to enter from the outside, they would be the opposite!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>"Mi'Chutz l'Paroches <i>ha'Edus</i> b'Ohel Mo'ed" - the Menorah is testimony to the world that the Shechinah dwells amidst Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Hash-m needs the light!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The 40 years in the Midbar, Hash-m illuminated for Yisrael (with a pillar of fire)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rather, the Menorah is only for testimony that the Shechinah dwells amidst Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What it the testimony?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The testimony was the western lamp. (According to the opinion that the length of the Menorah is north-south, the middle lamp tilts westward. According to the opinion that it is east-west, this refers to the more western of the two easternmost lamps);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The same amount of oil was put in all the lamps, and all were lit just before evening. The others would finish burning in the morning, but the western lamp burned the entire day.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE BEST WINE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kedochin and Atulin are the best places for wine. The next best places are Beis Rimah and Beis Lavan in the mountain, and Signa in the valley.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Any place is Kosher, just they used to bring from these places.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We do not use grapes of Beis ha'Zevalim, Beis ha'Shelachin, or grapes that grow amidst other crops. If they were used (for Nesachim), they are Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>We do not bring from Halistiyon (from overripe grapes). If it was brought, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rebbi says, we do not bring old wine;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Chachamim permit this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>We do not bring wine that is sweet (naturally, not because the grapes were overripe), smoked or cooked. If it was brought, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>We do not use (grapes from) vines supported on poles. We use only low vines, from worked vineyards.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>We do not gather the wine in large barrels. (It is used little by little. If a barrel is partially empty for a long time, the remaining wine spoils.) Rather, we gather in small barrels;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>We do not fill the barrels to the top, in order that they should give off a nice smell.</p></div>
