<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>RITZUY TZITZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Kometz became Tamei and it was offered, the Tzitz is Meratzeh. (It is Machshir the Minchah and permits the Shirayim to be eaten);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the Kometz left the Azarah and was offered, the Tzitz is not Meratzeh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tzitz is Meratzeh for Tum'ah, but not for Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Question:</span> "V'Nasa Aharon Es Avon ha'Kodoshim" - what sin does (the Tzitz) bear?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be Pigul. We learn that from "Lo Yechashev"! (Here (and in some other places) Chachamim call Chutz li'Mkomo 'Pigul', even though one is not Chayav Kares for eating it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It cannot be Nosar, we learn that from "Lo Yeratzeh"! (Here, this refers to what the Torah calls Pigul, i.e. a Korban offered with intent to eat it when it is Nosar, i.e. Chutz li'Zmano.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It bears the sin of Tum'ah, for Tum'ah is wholly permitted to the Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Perhaps it bears the sin of Yotzei, which is wholly permitted on a Bamah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> "L'Ratzon Lahem Lifnei Hash-m" - the Tzitz is Meratzeh for a sin in front of Hash-m. Yotzei is not in front of Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Ila'a):</span> Perhaps it bears the sin of Smol (Avodah using the left hand), for this is wholly permitted on Yom Kipur! (The Kohen Gadol carries the spoon with incense in his left hand.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Tzitz is Meratzeh for "Avon", i.e. something that is always forbidden, but is Nidcheh (permitted, b'Di'eved) to the Tzibur. Smol is used l'Chatchilah on Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Tzitz bears "Avon ha'Kodoshim", not sin of the Makdishim (people, who did the Avodah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Simi):</span> Perhaps it bears the sin of a (Korban) Ba'al Mum, for this is wholly permitted in birds!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Zevachim must be unblemished and (sometimes) must be male. Regarding birds, we are never concerned for these.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> "(A Ba'al Mum) Lo Yeratzeh" - it will not be accepted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN THE TZITZ IS NOT MERATZEH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If the blood became Tamei and Zerikah was done:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was b'Shogeg, it is Meratzeh. If it was b'Mezid, Lo Hurtzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This applies to a Korban Yachid. A Korban Tzibur is Meratzeh even b'Mezid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Korban of a Nochri is not Meratzeh even b'Shogeg.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> The Tzitz is Meratzeh for (Tum'ah of) blood, meat and Chelev that became Tamei, whether b'Shogeg or b'Mezid or b'Ones, for a Korban Yachid or a Korban Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> Beraisa #1 is like Chachamim. Beraisa #2 is R. Yosi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not separate Tamei produce to be Terumah on (to exempt) Tahor produce;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If this was done b'Shogeg, it becomes Terumah. If it was done b'Mezid, it is not Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, whether it was done b'Shogeg or b'Mezid, it becomes Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Granted, R. Yosi does not fine one who separated Tamei Terumah, but he does not hold that the Tzitz is Meratzeh for eating!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The Tzitz is Meratzeh for eating;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, it is not Meratzeh for eating.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must switch the opinions of R. Eliezer and R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> We cannot switch the opinions!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if a Tamei person ate Tamei Kodshim before Zerikah he is liable!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Kol Tahor Yochal Basar" - one is liable for eating Kodesh meat b'Tum'ah only if it was once permitted to Tahor people.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is liable for eating (b'Tum'ah) Kodshim that is (at the time) permitted to Tehorim. This would exclude Lan and Yotzei!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher la'Shem" includes these.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we include Pigul and Nosar!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Nosar is Lan. We already included it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, perhaps we include Pigul, just like Nosar!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Mi'Zevach ha'Shelamim" excludes (Pigul).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The verses that include and exclude do not specify what to include or exclude.) Why do we include Lan and Nosar, and exclude Pigul?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We include Lan and Nosar, for they had Sha'as ha'Kosher (they were once permitted). Pigul never had Sha'as ha'Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a Tamei liable for eating after Zerikah Kodesh that became Tamei before Zerikah? (It was never permitted to Tehorim!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tzitz is Meratzeh. (It is as if the meat was once permitted);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is only if the meat became Tamei, but not if it was Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana holds that Zerikah does not help for Yotzei (it is as if there was no Sha'as ha'Kosher)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p><span class="cl">Culmination of objection:</span> This Beraisa is R. Eliezer, and it says that the Tzitz is Meratzeh for eating!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #2 (to contradiction (b) - Rav Chisda):</span> Beraisa #1 is Chachamim, and Beraisa #2 is R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, R. Eliezer says that the Tzitz is Meratzeh for food. However, this does not show that he does not make a fine that it is not Meratzeh for Mezid in a Korban Yachid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we know that he says this, just like R. Yosi does!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Whether it was done b'Shogeg or b'Mezid, it becomes Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, R. Eliezer does not fine regarding Terumah. However, Kodshim are more stringent. Perhaps he fines regarding Kodshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, Beraisa #2 would be unlike any Tana we know! (We do not widen the argument and assume that it is like a Tana whose opinion we never heard elsewhere, unless we are forced to./)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #3 (to contradiction (b) - Ravina):</span> Beraisa #2 discusses how it became Tamei (the Tzitz is Meratzeh even for Mezid). Beraisa #1 discusses the intent during Zerikah (there is Ritzuy for a Korban Yachid only if it was Shogeg).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #4 (Rav Shila):</span> Beraisa #1 discusses how it became Tamei, Beraisa #2 discusses the intent during Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Shila - Beraisa #2):</span> The Tzitz is Meratzeh for blood, meat and Chelev that became Tamei, whether b'Shogeg or b'Mezid...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, if they became Tamei b'Shogeg, the Tzitz is Meratzeh whether the Zerikah was b'Shogeg or b'Mezid...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Shila - Beraisa #1):</span> If the blood became Tamei and Zerikah was done, if it was b'Shogeg, it is Meratzeh. If it was b'Mezid, Lo Hurtzah.</p></div>
