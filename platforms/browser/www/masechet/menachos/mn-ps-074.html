<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MINCHAS CHOTEI OF KOHANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> It does not say 'V'Haysah la'Kohen ka'Minchaso', rather, "ka'Minchah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, the verse equates a Kohen's Minchas Chotei to a Yisrael's - just like a Yisrael's Minchas Chotei is Nikmetzes, also a Kohen's.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Yisrael's Minchas Chotei is Nikmetzes, the Shirayim are eaten - perhaps the same applies to a Kohen's!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "La'Kohen ka'Minchah" - the Kohen's Avodah is the same (it is Nikmetzes), but it is different regarding the part that is burned;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Kometz is Huktar by itself, the Shirayim are Hukteru by themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A different verse teaches that a Kohen may offer his own Minchas Chotei!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that a Kohen may offer his own (Rashi - obligatory) Korbanos whenever he wants (even when another Mishmar is serving?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Uva b'Chol Avas Nafsho...v'Sheres".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If that was the only source, one might have thought that it does not apply to Korbanos brought due to Chet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Chiper ha'Kohen Al ha'Nefesh ha'Shogeges b'Chet'ah vi'Shgagah" teaches that a Kohen can offer a Korban for his own Chet!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that that is only for Shogeg, but not for Mezid - "V'Haysah la'Kohen ka'Minchah" teaches, even b'Mezid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of Minchas Chotei for Mezid (normally, Chatas is only for Shogeg!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He intentionally swore Shevu'as ha'Edus falsely (he denied knowing testimony.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> A Kohen's Minchas Chotei is Nikmetzes, the Kometz and Shirayim are each offered by themselves;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, the Kometz is offered by itself, and the Shirayim are spread on Beis ha'Deshen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> Which Beis ha'Deshen are they spread on?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He cannot mean on top of the Mizbe'ach, for this is like his father! (Surely, in the Beraisa he comes to argue.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He cannot mean on the ground. We do not offer on the ground!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (R. Aba):</span> Perhaps (it is on the ground).  They are not offered. They are burned like Pasul Korbanos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>People laughed at this. We do not bring a Korban in order that it will go to waste!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avin's father - Beraisa):</span> "V'Chol Minchas Kohen Kalil Tihyeh Lo Se'achel" equates them only regarding eating. (The previous verse teaches that Chavitei Kohen Gadol are Kalil (entirely burned on the Mizbe'ach). This verse forbids eating Minchas Nedavah of a Kohen. Rashi Kesav Yad - this defends R. Aba. Also a Kohen's Minchas Nedavah is not eaten nor Kalil. It is offered to go to waste! Rashi - we do not defend R. Aba. This is a new, unrelated teaching. R. Aba must hold that a Gezeras ha'Kasuv teaches that a Kohen's Minchas Chotei goes to waste.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> "Kol Minchas Kohen... Lo Se'achel' teaches that even Chovos (such as Minchas Chotei) of a Kohen may not be eaten, (like Chavitim). 'Kalil Tihyeh' refers to his Nedavos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> You cannot cut up the verses like that (to apply the end of the verse to the beginning!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "V'Chol Minchas Kohen Kalil Tihyeh" refers to his Nedavos. "Lo Se'achel" refers to his Chovos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against both answers; Rashba - perhaps this is only against Rava, for Abaye holds that "Kol Minchas..." comes to include only Chovos):</span> Perhaps we should say just the contrary! (Nedavos may not be eaten, and Chovos must be Kalil!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to learn like they (Rashba - Rava) did, for Nedavos are like Chavitim. Both (can or do) come every day, they are not due to Chet, and they have a nice smell (they have oil and Levonah; alternatively, regarding them it says "Re'ach Nicho'ach");</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that Chovos are like Chavitim. Both cannot be more than one Isaron, and are obligatory!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are more similarities of Nedavos to Chavitim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>KALIL TIHYEH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim (who say that Minchas Kohanim is not Nikmetzes) expound?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Answer (Beraisa) The first verse teaches that Chavitei Kohen Gadol are Kalil. The latter forbids eating Minchas Nedavah of a Kohen;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to apply to each of these laws (Kalil and a Lav against eating) to the other?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Kalil-Kalil". Just like Kalil of Chavitim is "Taktar (entirely Huktar)", also that of Nedavah. Just like a Lav forbids eating Chavitim, also regarding Nidvas Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If a Kohen ate Eimurim, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely he transgressed the Lav forbidding a Zar to eat Kodshei Kodoshim. (Since he may not eat them, it is as if he is a Zar);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">74b----------------------------------------74b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Does he transgress "Kalil Tihyeh"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Aharon - Beraisa):</span> Whenever it says "Kalil Tihyeh", a Lav forbids eating it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THINGS TOTALLY FOR THE MIZBE'ACH OR FOR KOHANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Minchas Kohanim, Chavitei Kohen Gadol and Minchas Nesachim are totally Kalil on the Mizbe'ach. Kohanim do not receive any part of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding these, the Mizbe'ach has greater Ko'ach (privileges) than Kohanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Shtei ha'Lechem and Lechem ha'Panim are totally eaten by Kohanim. No part of them goes on the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding these, Kohanim have greater Ko'ach than the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Questions:</span> There are other things that are totally for the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Olah is Kalil on the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Its skin is given to Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Olas ha'Of is Kalil on the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Its innards and the attached feathers are not put on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> Nesachim (of wine) go entirely on the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are poured through the Shitin (conduits in the Mizbe'ach. The Mizbe'ach does not consume the wine.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says 'regarding these', the Mizbe'ach has greater Ko'ach. What do we learn from these words?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This teaches unlike Shmuel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Nedavos of wine are sprinkled on the fire on the Mizbe'ach. (According to Shmuel, the Mizbe'ach has greater Ko'ach also regarding Nedavos of wine.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Our Tana holds that all wine is poured through the Shitin. (Shmuel is not refuted, for perhaps our Tana is like R. Yehudah, who forbids Davar she'Eino Miskaven (something that might result in an Isur, but one does not intend for this. Wine might partially extinguish the fire on the Mizbe'ach), but R. Shimon (who permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven) would say that Nedavos of wine go on the fire.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This supports a different teaching of Shmuel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Kemitzah is taken (and Huktar) from Nedavos of oil, and Kohanim eat the Shirayim. (Our Tana cannot hold that oil is totally Huktar, for then the Mizbe'ach would have greater Ko'ach regarding Nedavos of oil.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shtei ha'Lechem and Lechem ha'Panim...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions:</span> There are other things that are totally eaten by Kohanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Chatas ha'Of is totally eaten by Kohanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The blood is sprinkled on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Kohanim eat the Log of oil of a Metzora. None goes on the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They do not eat all of it. Some of it is sprinkled towards the Heichal, and some is put on the ear, thumb and toe of the Metzora.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says 'regarding these', Kohanim have greater Ko'ach. What do we learn from these words?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This argues with the opinion that when Shtei ha'Lechem are brought by themselves (without Kivsei Atzeres), they are burned;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Our Tana holds that Kohanim always eat Shtei ha'Lechem (i.e. even in this case).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MATANOS OF OIL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> For every Minchah made in a Kli, we put oil three times - Yetzikah (putting on oil after they are cooked), for Belilah (mixing it with oil), and oil is put in the Kli before the Soles.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rebbi says, after the Minchah is baked into Chalos, they are (crumbed and) Belulos (mixed) with oil;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chachamim say, Belilah is done while it is Soles (before baking).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Chalos (Rashi - of Ma'afe Tanur; Shitah Mekubetzes - of all Menachos) require Belilah. Rekikim require Meshichah (oil is spread on them).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Meshichah is done like 'Chai' (this will be explained). The rest of the oil is eaten by Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does 'made in a Kli' come to exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It excludes Ma'afe Tanur. (The Tana holds that the oven is not Mekadesh, so he does not call them 'made in a Kli.')</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Im Minchas Marcheshes Korbanecha Soles ba'Shemen Te'aseh" teaches that (flour is added after) oil is put in the Kli;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Gezerah Shavah "Korbanecha-Korbanecha" teaches that also Minchas Machavas requires oil in the Kli;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We also learn Marcheshes from Machavas to require Yetzikah and Belilah.</p></div>
