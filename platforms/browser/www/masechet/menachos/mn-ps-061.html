<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we include other Menachos and exclude Minchas Nesachim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable that other Menachos have Hagashah, for they come due to themselves, but Minchas Nesachim is due to a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Minchas Kohanim and Chavitim come due to themselves. Perhaps Hagashah applies to them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "v'Higishah" (only these, and not others).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is needed for the simple meaning, to teach Hagashah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said "v'Higish". Rather, it says "v'Higishah" to exclude.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we include other Menachos, and exclude Minchas Kohanim and Chavitim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable that other Menachos have Hagashah, for they are partially Huktar, partially eaten and come due to themselves;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We exclude Shtei ha'Lechem and Lechem ha'Panim, which are totally eaten, Minchas Nesachim, which is due to a Korban, and Minchas Kohanim and Chavitim, which are Kalil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "v'Herim" (Vayikra 2:9, regarding Marcheshes) teaches that Kemitzah is taken with a Kli!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Herim Mimenu b'Kumtzo" - it is taken with his fingers.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHICH KORBANOS REQUIRE TENUFAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following require Tenufah, but not Hagashah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Log of oil and the Asham of a Metzora;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Bikurim, according to R. Eliezer ben Yakov;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Eimurim, chest and foreleg of a (regular) Shelamim, whether a man or woman brought it;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This applies to Yisrael, but not to others. (This will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Shtei ha'Lechem and the two Kivsei Atzeres;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The two loaves are put on top of the lambs. He puts his hands underneath;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>He waves them outward and back to himself, and up and down - "Asher Hunaf va'Asher Huram."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Tenufah is (Kosher even) in the east (part of the Azarah). Hagashah is in the west.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Tenufah is done before Hagashah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Omer and Minchas Kena'os require Hagashah and Tenufah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Lechem ha'Panim and Minchas Nesachim do not require Hagashah nor Tenufah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Shimon says, there are three Korbanos and three Mitzvos. Exactly two Mitzvos apply to each of the Korbanos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A regular Shelamim has Semichah mi'Chayim (while the Korban is alive) and Tenufah after Shechitah, but not Tenufah mi'Chayim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Shalmei Tzibur has Tenufah mi'Chayim and after Shechitah, but not Semichah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Asham Metzora has Semichah and Tenufah mi'Chayim, but not after Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "V'Hikriv Oso l'Asham v'Es Log ha'Shemen v'Henif Osam Tenufah" teaches that they are waved together;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if they were waved individually, he was Yotzei?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Hikriv Oso l'Asham v'Henif (singular)".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they are waved together, and then they are waved individually!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Tenufah (singular)", not Tenufos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>"Lifnei Hash-m" is in the east.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Hagashah, we expounded "Lifnei Hash-m" to mean in the west!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to Menachos, which are equated to Chatas;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shirei Dam Chatas must be thrown (on Pnei ha'Mizbe'ach, i.e. the south, and) over the Yesod. The southeast corner has no Yesod, so it must be in the southwest corner;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding Tenufah, (the entire Azarah,) even the east is Lifnei Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TENUFAH OF BIKURIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Bikurim (requires Tenufah), according to R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Eliezer ben Yakov's teaching about Bikurim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> "V'Lakach ha'Kohen" teaches that Bikurim require Tenufah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does he learn this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from a Gezerah Shavah "Yad-Yad" from Shelamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says here "v'Lakach ha'Kohen ha'Tene mi'Yadecha", and it says regarding Shelamim "Yadav Tevi'enah";</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">61b----------------------------------------61b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Just like the Kohen does Tenufah of Bikurim, also regarding Shelamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Just like the owner does Tenufah of Shelamim, also regarding Bikurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we fulfill both of these?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kohen puts his hand under the owner's hands, and they wave together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Mishnah say that Bikurim requires Tenufah according to R. Eliezer ben Yakov? Also R. Yehudah says so!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "V'Hinachto" refers to Tenufah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it really refers to Hanachah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hinicho" already teaches about Hanachah, so "v'Hinachto" must refer to Tenufah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah cites R. Eliezer ben Yakov, for he learns from the beginning of the verse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It cites him, for he is a great Chacham. The Halachah always follows him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Eimurim, chest and foreleg of a (regular) Shelamim, whether a man or woman brought it (require Tenufah). This applies to Yisrael, but not to others.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Korban requires Tenufah, whether a man or woman brought it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Only male Yisraelim do Tenufah with the Kohen, but women do not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> Bnei Yisrael do Tenufah, but Nochrim and women do not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>R. Yosi says, regarding Semichah, the Torah distinguishes between Korbanos of Yisrael (they require Semichah) and those of Nochrim and women (they are exempt);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it also distinguishes regarding Tenufah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. It distinguishes regarding Semichah, for the owner himself must be Somech;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Kohen does Tenufah (albeit with the owner, when possible), therefore it does not depend on the owner.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "Bnei Yisrael"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Bnei Yisrael do Tenufah, but Benos Yisrael do not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> "Bnei Yisrael" teaches that Korbanos of Bnei (i.e. native) Yisraelim require Tenufah;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "ha'Makriv" (anyone who offers).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this teaches that only the one (the Kohen) who offers the Chelev does Tenufah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yadav Tevi'enah" teaches that the owner does Tenufah;</p></div>
