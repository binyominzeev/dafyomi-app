<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one was Mefagel (intended to eat the Shirayim Chutz li'Zmano) during Haktarah of the Kometz but not of the Levonah, or vice-versa, the Minchah is Pigul, and there is Kares (for eating the Shirayim);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, there is no Kares unless he was Mefagel in (Avodah of) the entire Matir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chachamim agree with R. Meir that if one was Mefagel in the Kometz of Minchas Chotei or Minchas Kena'os, it is Pigul, and there is Kares, for the Kometz is the Matir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Meir says, if one slaughtered one of the lambs with intent to eat both loaves tomorrow, or Hiktir one Bezech with intent to eat both Sedarim tomorrow, the bread is Pigul, and there is Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Chachamim say, there is no Kares unless he was Mefagel in the entire Matir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If he slaughtered one of the lambs with intent to eat it tomorrow, it is Pigul, the other lamb is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he slaughtered it with intent to eat a k'Zayis of the other lamb tomorrow, both are Kesherim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> The argument is when he offered the Kometz in silence, and (then) he was Mefagel in the Levonah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he was Mefagel in the Kometz and (then) offered the Levonah silently, all agree that it is Pigul, for all subsequent Avodos are (assumed to be) with the same intent as the first.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Rav Acha bar Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> Intent in (only) the Kometz can be Mefagel if this is during Kemitzah, Nesinah or Holachah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir says, when he comes to do Haktarah, if he was Nosen (Maktir) the Kometz silently and the Levonah (with intent) Chutz li'Zmano, or the Kometz Chutz li'Zmano and the Levonah silently, it is Pigul, and there is Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, Kares does not apply unless he was Mefagel in all the Matirim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> They argue (even) when he offered the Kometz Chutz li'Zmano and the Levonah silently!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It means, he offered the Kometz Chutz li'Zmano after he offered the Levonah silently.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> If so, this is essentially the Reisha (the Kometz silently and then the Levonah Chutz li'Zmano). Why must both be taught?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> A different Beraisa explicitly says that they argue when he was Maktir the Kometz Chutz li'Zmano and then the Levonah silently!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chanina):</span> Two different people offered the Kometz and Levonah. (Clearly, we do not say that the second offers with the intent of the first.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One Matanah can make Pigul in outer Korbanos (i.e. on the outer Mizbe'ach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding inner Korbanos, i.e. the Par and Sa'ir of Yom Kipur, which require a total of 43 Matanos (eight from each between the staves of the Aron, and on the Paroches, and 11 (from their bloods mixed together) on the inner Mizbe'ach,) or Par Mashu'ach or Par He'elam Davar (which require 11 Matanos on the inner Mizbe'ach), whether he was Mefagel in the first, second or third (set of Matanos), the Korban is Pigul, and there is Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, Kares does not apply unless he was Mefagel in all the Matirim (Matanos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> They argue even when he was Mefagel in the first set. Chachamim do not say that all Matanos follow the initial intent!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is when different people did the Matanos (like we answered above).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Partial rejection:</span> This is only according to the opinion that different Kohanim may do the Matanos with blood of the same Par (e.g. if the Kohen Gadol became Pasul and had to be replaced in the middle of the Avodah);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>According to the opinion that a different Kohen cannot Zorek blood of the same Par (he must slaughter a new Par), how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> The case is, he was explicitly Mefagel in the first and third (our text; Tzon Kodoshim - second) sets, and he was silent during the other set;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Chachamim say,) since he saw a need to verbalize his intent in the third (Tzon Kodoshim - second) set, this shows that he does not do all Matanos like his initial intent!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> The Beraisa does not say that he was silent during the second (T.K. - third) set!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, he was explicitly Mefagel in the first, second and third sets (but not the fourth, i.e. the Shirayim; Tosfos - the Tana holds that they are Me'akev. Some explain that the four Matanos on the Keranos of the inner Mizbe'ach are counted separately from the seven Matanos on Tiharo (its top or middle), therefore there are four sets.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi) Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, he was explicitly Mefagel in the first and second sets, but was silent during the third. (end of Version #2)</p></div>

<div class="bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says 'whether he was Mefagel in the first, second or third'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> (Whether he was Mefagel in the first, second or third set) the Korban is Pigul, and there is Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Pigul does not apply unless all the Matirim were offered (without any Pesul other than Chutz li'Zmano)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Becoming Pigul is like becoming acceptable. A Korban does not become Pigul until finishing all the Avodos needed for a Kosher Korban to bring atonement (without any other Pesul).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Once he was Mefagel inside (the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim), the rest of the blood is Nifsal. Putting it (on the Mizbe'ach) in the Heichal is like putting water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> The case is, the blood spilled after finishing each set of Matanos. A new Par and Sa'ir were slaughtered for the remaining Matanos. A total of four Parim and four Se'irim are brought.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It is possible even if only one Par and one Sa'ir are brought;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When one is Mefagel in any of the 43 Matanos, we consider the subsequent Zerikos to be proper to make Pigul (just like intent in Shechitah is Mefagel, even though Zerikah will not be Machshir the Korban.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> This Beraisa says that there are 43 Matanos. Another Beraisa says that there are 47 Matanos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana who says 43 holds that the bloods of the Par and Sa'ir are mixed together for all the Matanos on the inner Mizbe'ach. The Tana who says 47 holds that the bloods are offered (together on Tiharo, but) separately (on the four Keranos of the inner Mizbe'ach, therefore, there are four more.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> There are 48 Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Tana holds that (the bloods are offered separately on the Keranos, and) the Shirayim are Me'akev. (Therefore, he counts them.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he was Mefagel during Holachah (of the Kometz), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> Holachah is like Kemitzah. (All agree that Kemitzah makes Pigul, for this is the full Avodah, i.e. it does not apply to the Levonah);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> Holachah is like Haktarah. (R. Meir and Chachamim argue about one who was Mefagel in one of the Matirim, i.e. the Kometz or the Levonah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand Reish Lakish, for Holachah applies also to Levonah. (He was Mefagel only in part of the Matir);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is R. Yochanan's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He holds that (Chachamim agree that) any Avodah that does not permit (Rashi - is not Me'akev) is an important Avodah, and it can be Mefagel by itself. (Rashba - anything called Avodah can be Mefagel, even if it does not permit.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Shechitah of one of the lambs (brought with Shtei ha'Lechem) is an Avodah that does not permit, yet they argue about whether it is Mefagel!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one slaughtered one of the lambs with intent to eat both loaves tomorrow, or was Maktir one Bezech with intent to eat both Sedarim (of Lechem ha'Panim) tomorrow, the bread is Pigul, and there is Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, there is no Kares unless he was Mefagel in the entire Matir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> You think that the oven is Mekadesh the loaves. This is wrong. Shechitah of the lambs is Mekadesh them. Something that is Mekadesh is like something that permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Simi bar Ashi - Beraisa - Others):</span> (If one slaughtered Korban Pesach with intent that Mulim and Arelim (circumcised and uncircumcised men) eat from it):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the intent for Mulim preceded the intent for Arelim, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the intent for Arelim preceded the intent for Mulim, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(A Mishnah (Pesachim 61a) is Machshir in both cases.) We know that Others argue (with that Tana) when each intent was during the Shechitah of one Siman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> You think that the blood is already Kadosh in the animal's neck. This is wrong, Shechitah is Mekadesh it. Something that is Mekadesh is like something that permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> Intent in (only) the Kometz can be Mefagel if this is during Kemitzah, Nesinah, or Holachah. (This is the Beraisa on 16a, 1:i.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Beraisa refers to Holachah towards (the Mizbe'ach, for) Haktarah. All agree that this makes Pigul, even though this is not the full Avodah! (Holachah applies also to Levonah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Beraisa refers to Holachah towards Nesinah (which does not apply to Levonah). This is a full Avodah. All agree that it makes Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Beraisa say '... during Kemitzah, Nesinah, or Holachah'? Holachah should be listed before Nesinah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the text should list Holachah before Nesinah.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Holachah is a need of Haktarah, the Tana calls it Haktarah.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If one was Maktir (the entire Kometz,) the volume of a sesame seed at a time, each time with intent to eat (Chutz li'Zmano) the volume of (another) sesame seed (in all, a k'Zayis), Rav Chisda, Rav Hamnuna and Rav Sheshes argued.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> These opinions (Pigul, Pasul, Kosher) are, respectively, like R. Meir, Chachamim and Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps none of these are correct!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir said that intent during a proper Shi'ur of Avodah (of one of the Matirim) makes Pigul. We have no source that he says so about intent during (Shitah Mekubetzes - much) less than a Shi'ur! (Perhaps such intents do not join.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim said that intent during only part of the Matirim is Pasul (and not Pigul). We have no source that they say so about intent during the entire Matir;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rebbi was Machshir only when an entire Avodah was done with intent (Chutz) for less than a Shi'ur. We have no source that he is Machshir when (altogether) there was intent for a Shi'ur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rather, each opinion is according to all Tana'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The one who says that it is Pigul holds that piecemeal eating (the volume of a sesame seed at a time) is considered eating. Piecemeal Haktarah is considered Haktarah (therefore, it is a genuine intent of Pigul);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The one who says that it is Pasul holds that piecemeal eating is (not - some texts deletes this word) considered eating, and piecemeal Haktarah is not considered Haktarah (to make Pigul or to be Machshir the Korban).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="note"><span>Note:</span> It does not depend on what he holds about eating.

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The one who says that it is Kosher holds that piecemeal eating is not considered eating, but piecemeal Haktarah is considered Haktarah. (Therefore, it is a Kosher Haktarah.)</p></div>
