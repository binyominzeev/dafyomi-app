<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE AMOS OF THE MIKDASH (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, "v'Chek ha'Amah" is the height of the Yesod. "V'Amah Rochav" is the width of the Yesod. "U'Gevulah El Sefasah Soviv" is the height of the Keranos. (Each of these is five Tefachim). It does not matter if the width of each Keren was five or six Tefachim. (The Sovev was six Tefachim wide, so in any case the Ma'arachah was less than 25 Amos. It is not difficult if the Navi says that it was 12 from the middle (in every direction), since it was less than 12 and a half - Rashash.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How tall is the Mizbe'ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is 58 Tefachim. (The Yesod and Keranos are five-Tefachim Amos, and the others are six.)  Half the height is 29. Six Tefachim above this is the Sovev, for it is 23 Tefachim below the top.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he squeezed out the blood even an Amah below his legs, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> The verse "v'Chek ha'Amah v'Amah Rochav" changes form 'Chek' to 'Rochav' to teach that they are different. (Chek refers to height, and Rochav refers to width.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a medium Amah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It is six Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (R. Yosi bar Avin - Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> The Shulchan was 12 Tefachim long and six Tefachim wide. (The Torah says that it is two Amos long and one Amah wide. Above (97a), R. Meir said that all Amos of the Mikdash (except for the Mizbe'ach) are medium.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is called a medium Amah, this implies that there is a bigger Amah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There were two rods for measuring an Amah in Shushan ha'Birah (a place in the Mikdash, like we explain below). One was in the northeast corner, and one in the the southeast corner. The one in the northeast corner was half an Etzba (finger) bigger than the (six Tefachim) Amah of Moshe, and the one in the southeast corner was one Etzba bigger.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why were there a big Amah and  a small Amah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Workers (who contracted to build for Hekdesh) were hired (to build) based on the Amah of Moshe. What they made was measured by a larger Midah, lest they be overpaid and transgress Me'ilah. (Tosfos - even if they were overpaid they would not transgress Me'ilah, Even so, they did not want to be overpaid.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why were there two [Amos bigger than Moshe's]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One was for gold and silver, and one was for building.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There was a picture of Shushan ha'Birah on top of the eastern gate. (This Mishnah discusses gates of Har ha'Bayis. The Rashash questions those who say it was the eastern gate of the Azarah (Rashi here) or of the Ezras Nashim (R. Shimshon).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda or R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> It was to remind Yisrael from where they came (to make them grateful to Hash-m for redeeming them);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of Rav Chisda and R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> It was to put the fear of the Persian kingdom upon them (so they would not rebel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> One should fear the kingdom. Moshe told Paro "v'Yardu Chol Avadecha Eleh Elai v'Hishtachavu Li." (Paro himself would come and bow. Moshe euphemstically attributed this to Paro's servants.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We can learn from "...Eliyahu vay'Shanes Masnav va'Yaratz Lifnei Ach'av." (Eliyahu ran in front of Achav, for it is not honorable for a king to be unattended.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A CURE FROM THE MIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of  "v'Alehu li'Srufah" (regarding the river from the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi or Rav Chisda):</span> It is LehaTiR PeH (to open the mouth, i.e. cures muteness (Rashi) or gives appetite to eat (Aruch));</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (the other of R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi and Rav Chisda, also Bar Kapara):</span> It opens the lower mouth (womb, i.e. cures barren women).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Chizkiyah):</span> It cures muteness. (According to Rashi, Chizkiyah merely explains Answer #1.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SIZE OF THE PILES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Had it said 'v'Lakachta Soles v'Afisa Osam Shteim Esreh Chalos v'Samta Osam Shtayim Ma'arachos', without saying 'six', we would have thought that the piles need not be even. E.g. one could be four and the other eight. Therefore, it says 'Shesh";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it said 'Shtayim Ma'arachos Shesh ha'Ma'areches', without saying '12', we would have thought that (Shesh ha'Ma'areches alludes to another pile, so in all) there are three piles of six. Therefore, it says "Shteim Esreh";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it said 'Shteim Esreh Chalos' and 'Ma'arachos', without saying 'two' and 'six', we would have thought that there may be three piles of four. Therefore, it says "Shtayim" and "Shesh";</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Summation:</span> All of these are needed to teach that there are two piles of six.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one pile has four and the other eight, the Mitzvah was not fulfilled;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If each pile has seven, was the Mitzvah fulfilled?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> We ignore the top Chalah in each pile. (It is as if each has six. The Mitzvah was fulfilled.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We must fulfill "v'Nasata Al" (the Bazichei Levonah must be on top of the Lechem ha'Panim. The extra Chalah in each piles is a Chatzitzah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda or Rav Hamnuna):</span> We know that Rebbi holds that "Al" can mean 'near'. (The Bazichim are placed in between the Ma'arachos):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "V'Nasata Al ha'Ma'areches Levonah Zakah" - "Al" means nearby;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it literally means 'on'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "v'Sakosa Al ha'Aron Es ha'Paroches." (We know that the Paroches was not over the Aron. Surely) this means 'near'.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE PLACEMENT OF THE KELIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Kelim in the Mikdash...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All Kelim in the Mikdash are placed lengthwise towards the length of the Mikdash (east-west), except for the Aron. Its length is towards the width of the Mikdash. So it was placed, and so were its staves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We know that the Aron was placed this way (north-south) due to its staves (which were east-west).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the staves must be east-west?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "va'Ya'arichu ha'Badim" (the staves were long), but they did not touch the Paroches!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Va'Yira'u" (they were seen).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they stuck out of a hole in the Paroches!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Lo Yera'u ha'Chutzah" (they were not seen).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">98b----------------------------------------98b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> They press against the Paroches and cause humps to stick out - "Dodi Li Bein Shadai Yalin." (The Paroches is east of the Aron. This shows that the staves were east-west.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the staves go along the width of the Aron (i.e. the length of the Aron is between the staves). Perhaps they go along its length!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> (Two men stand side by side in front of the Aron between the staves to carry the Aron, and another two stand similarly in back.) Two men cannot fit in one and a half Amos (the Aron's width. Rather, its length (two and a half Amos) is between the staves!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Regarding the size of a Mikveh, we say that an average person is one Amah wide. This is like one opinion in Sukah (7b). In burial caves, the cavities for coffins were an Amah wide. This includes the wall of the coffin. This implies that people are less than an Amah wide. The other opinion in Sukah (8a) says that people are two thirds of an Amah wide. Perhaps it is not proper for two people to walk side by side in one and a half Amos, even though it is possible.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that four men carry the Aron?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Nas'u ha'Kehasim" teaches about two. "Nos'ei ha'Mikdash" teaches another two.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Shlomo made 10 Shulchanos - "va'Ya'as Shulchanos Asarah va'Yanach ba'Heichal Chamishah mi'Yamin va'Chamishah mi'Smol."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If this means that five were to the right of the opening (of the Heichal) and five to its left, the latter were in the south half of the Heichal. However, it says "veha'Shulchan Titen Al Tzela Tzafon"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that five were to the right of Moshe's Shulchan, and five were to its left.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If five were to the right of the opening and five to its left, the former were in the north. However, it says "v'Es ha'Menorah Nochach ha'Shulchan"!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding the Ner Ma'aravi (the westernmost lamp (Tosfos - of the two easternmost lamps)) it says "Ya'aroch Oso...
