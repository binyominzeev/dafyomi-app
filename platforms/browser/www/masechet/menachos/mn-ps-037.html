<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi ha'Chorem:</span> Sometimes 'Yad' refers to the right - "va'Yar Yosef Ki Yashis Aviv Yad Yemino"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana holds that we never find that 'Yad' refers to the right unless it specifies so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Noson says, we have a different source. "U'Kshartam... ; u'Chsavtam" equates tying (the Shel Yad) with writing (a Mezuzah). Just like we use the right (more skilled) hand to write, we use it to tie;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Since a hand cannot tie Tefilin on itself,) this teaches that Tefilin is tied on the left hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yosi's source that Tefilin is tied on the left hand?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He learns like R. Noson.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> (In one place) it says "Yadchah (your hand)" with a 'Hei', enabling us to read 'Yad Kehah' (the weak hand. Alternatively, feminine words usually end with Hei, so this suggests the weaker hand.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba):</span> 'Hei' can be interchanged with 'Ches'. We should read it 'Yad Ko'ach' (the strong hand)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Since we can expound the way it is written (with a 'Hei'), we do not change it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Tana'im argue about this (Gra - like R. Aba and Rav Ashi);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "Yadchah" teaches that the Shel Yad is tied on the left hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Others say, "Yadcha (Mesoras ha'Shas - this should say Yadchah, with a Hei)" includes a Gidem (one whose arm was cut. Gra - he wears on his right arm, like R. Aba.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> Someone missing his arm is exempt from Tefilin (Shel Yad);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Others say, "Yadchah" includes a Gidem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3):</span> An Itar (left handed person) puts Tefilin on his right hand. This is his Smol (weak hand).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #4):</span> An Itar puts Tefilin on his left hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution (Abaye):</span> Beraisa #4 refers to an ambidextrous person.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHERE DO WE WEAR TEFILIN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei Menasheh):</span> "Al Yadecha" refers to Kibores (the fleshy part of the upper arm. The entire arm from the shoulder to the hand is called 'Yad'. "Bein Einecha" refers to the Kodkod (top of the head).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where on the Kodkod are Tefilin worn?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (D'Vei R. Yanai):</span> It is (up to) the part of the head that is soft in a baby.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Flimo):</span> If someone has two heads, on which does he wear Tefilin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> (Rashi - you mock me! Rashba (brought in Gilyon ha'Shas) - you doubt the words of Chachamim, who say that a Treifah cannot live more than a year, so the Mitzvah would never apply to him!) Choose your punishment - exile yourself, or you will be excommunicated!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>A man entered. He said that his (firstborn) son was born with two heads, and asked how much he must pay to redeem him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(An elder -Beraisa):</span> You must pay 10 Shekalim (five for each head).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This contradicts Rami bar Chama's Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> "Pado Sifdeh" (the verb is doubled) includes a baby that was torn (Rashi - and died; Tosfos - became Treifah) within 30 days; one must redeem him!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">37b----------------------------------------37b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rejection "Ach" distinguishes. (Some babies are not redeemed, i.e. those that cannot live (Rashi) or Treifos (Tosfos).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (The Tana of the Beraisa learned from "Chameshes Shekalim la'Gulgoles" that one must redeem every head). We must say that "Ach" excludes only a baby that died already (Rashi; Rashba - "...la'Gulgoles" teaches that one with an extra head can live for a long time, unlike other Treifos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Tana d'Vei Menasheh taught that "Al Yadecha" refers to Kibores. What is his source?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Al Yadecha" refers to the upper arm;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it refers to the palm!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> The Torah commands to wear Tefilin on the hand and head. Just like the latter is near the top of the head, the former is near the top of the Yad.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (R. Eliezer):</span> We learn from "v'Hayah Lecha l'Os." Hand Tefilin is visible to you (the wearer), but not to others (for it is covered by clothing).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #3 (R. Yitzchak):</span> We learn from "v'Samtem Es Devarai Eleh Al Levavchem... u'Kshartem." The hand Tefilin must be next to the heart.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>R. Chiya brei d'Rav Avya would wear the Shel Yad even with his heart.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Ameimar had a wound. His shirt was torn (to avoid aggravating the wound). His Tefilin could be seen through it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Don't you agree that "v'Hayah Lecha l'Os" teaches that the Shel Yad must be visible to you, but not to others?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Ameimar:</span> No. The verse teaches that it is worn in a place on the arm normally covered (not the palm).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa taught '(just like) head Tefilin is worn near the top of the head...' What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Bein Einecha" refers to (near) the top of the head.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is literally between the eyes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It also says "Lo Sasimu Karachah Bein Einechem la'Mes." Just like the Isur to tear out hair applies on top of the head (where hair grows), also the Mitzvah of Tefilin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, we have a different source. We equate the Shel Rosh to the Shel Yad:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like the Shel Yad is (on the flesh) in a place where only one kind of hair (i.e. white) is Metamei a Tzaru'a (makes him a Metzora Muchlat), also the Shel Rosh;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This cannot be between the eyes, for yellow hairs are Metamei in (Tzara'as in) the eyebrows (like the law of Tzara'as where hair grows on the head), and white hairs are Metamei in the rest of the area.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>IS EACH CORNER A SEPARATE MITZVAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The four Tzitzis (sets of strings on each of the four corners of a garment) are Me'akev each other, because they are all one Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the first Tana and R. Yishmael (who says that each of the four is a Mitzvah by itself)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> They disagree about a linen garment. (If there are strings of woolen Techeles on some but not all four corners, the first Tana says that one who wears it transgresses Kilayim. R. Yishmael exempts, since every string of Techeles is a Mitzvah, and it overrides the Lav of Kilayim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava bar Ahina):</span> They disagree about a garment with five (or more) corners. (All expound that one must attach Tzitzis. The first Tana holds that there is one Mitzvah to attach strings on four corners. R. Yishmael holds that there is a Mitzvah to attach strings on every corner.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> They argue whether or not Rav Huna's law applies (if there are strings on some but not all four corners);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If Pasul Tzitzis are on a garment, one who enters (or walks four Amos in) Reshus ha'Rabim while wearing must bring a Chatas (if he was Shogeg).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> If one cut off (on a diagonal) one of the four corners of his garment (this makes it five-cornered), he did not exempt it from Tzitzis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Mesharshiya):</span> If one folded his garment and stuck it together (so it will stay that way, and put Tzitzis on the (current) four corners), this does not suffice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely, it will come open later. We consider it as if it is open now, and the corners of the material are the real corners.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If material was folded to make a pouch, even though it holds things, it is Tahor (since it will later come open, it is not considered a Kli), except for those of Aravim. (They normally use such pouches.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi of Neharda'a):</span> If one folded the corners of his garment (and made them round) and sewed them (so they will stay that way), he did not exempt it from Tzitzis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he did not cut off the extra material, this shows that he plans to later undo the stitching. We consider it as if the corners are still proper corners.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> (Tzitzis on) each of the four (corners) is a Mitzvah by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yishmael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>The Halachah does not follow him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> On the Shabbos of the Regel (before the festival, when they expound laws of the festival), Ravina noticed that a corner of Mar bar Rav Ashi's garment (with the Tzitzis) had snapped off. He did not tell him until Mar reached his house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Mar bar Rav Ashi:</span> Had you told me earlier, I would have taken off my garment right away!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> That would be embarrassing (to walk home without your garment). Kavod ha'Briyos (avoiding disgrace) overrides a Lav (walking in Reshus ha'Rabim wearing a garment with invalid Tzitzis)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Mar bar Rav Ashi:</span> Rav bar Sheva explained that it overrides only the Lav of Lo Sasur (which commands us to follow mid'Rabanan laws).</p></div>
