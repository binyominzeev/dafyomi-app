<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE REWARD FOR WEARING TZITZIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Chilazon has the form of a fish. Its color is like the sea. Techeles is made from its blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Chilazon comes up only once every 70 years. Therefore Techeles is expensive.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Noson):</span> Even a light Mitzvah has (great) reward in this world. I cannot fathom the reward in the world to come!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We can learn from a certain Talmid who was careful in the Mitzvah of Tzitzis. He heard about a harlot on an island who took 400 gold coins for her hire. He sent her the money and fixed a date. She set seven beds for him, each higher than the other, and sat naked on the highest, made of gold. He climbed up to sit naked with her. His four Tzitziyos came and hit him on the head. (Iyun Yakov - from her response, it is clear that she did not see this. Perhaps he imagined that this happened.) He descended and sat on the ground. She sat next to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">The harlot:</span> You must tell me - what blemish did you see in me?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">The Talmid:</span> I never saw anyone as beautiful as you. However, Hash-m gave us the Mitzvah of Tzitzis, in which it says twice "Ani Hash-m Elokeichem", for He will punish and give reward;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The four Tzitziyos are like two pairs of witnesses against me!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">The harlot:</span> You must tell me your name, your city, your Rebbi and where you learn!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>He told her. She sold all her property (except for the sheets), gave a third of the money to the kingdom (to allow her to convert), a third to the poor, and took a third with her. She came to R. Chiya (his Rebbi) and asked him to convert her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> Perhaps you merely want to marry one of the Talmidim! (We do not accept converts for this purpose.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>The harlot showed him a paper (and explained that her awe for the Mitzvah, and that the miracle, that the Tzitzis struck him on the face, inspired her to convert).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> I will convert you (and allow you to marry him).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>Previously, she set sheets for him to sin. Now she set for him for Heter. .</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Noson):</span> This demonstrates the reward in this world. I cannot fathom the reward in the world to come!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A borrowed garment is exempt for 30 days. (Rosh - this is if it does not have Tzitzis. If it has Tzitzis, the Mitzvah applies immediately.) After this, it is obligated. (It seems that this is mid'Rabanan - Tosfos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One who stays in an inn in Eretz Yisrael, or rents a house in Chutz la'Aretz is exempt from Mezuzah for 30 days. After this, he is obligated;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who rents a house in Eretz Yisrael is obligated immediately, for the sake of settling Eretz Yisrael. (This discourages him from leaving, for he must leave the Mezuzah. Even if he leaves, it makes it easier for someone else to take his place.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE MITZVAH OF TEFILIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Tefilin Shel Yad is not Me'akev (the Shel Rosh, nor vice-versa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This is only if the person has both Tefilin. If he only has one of them, he cannot do the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Did you really say that?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> No. If one cannot do two Mitzvos, he should at least do one! (Rav Chisda retracted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was Rav Chisda's original reasoning?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He decreed, lest a person with only one Tefilah not bother to acquire the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> One who does not wear Tefilin transgresses eight Mitzvos Aseh. (Four verses command about each of the two Tefilin.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who does not put Tzitzis on his garment transgresses five Mitzvos Aseh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Kohen who does not give Birkas Kohanim (when asked to do so in a Beis ha'Keneses) transgresses three Mitzvos Aseh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One who does not put a Mezuzah in his doorway transgresses two Mitzvos Aseh. Two (identical) verses command to affix a Mezuzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> One who wears Tefilin will live a long life - "Hash-m Aleihem (those who have Hash-m's name on them, i.e. Tefilin) Yichyu... Chayei Ruchi v'Sachalimeni v'Hachayeni".</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>NESACHIM OF FLOUR AND WINE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Soles and oil (of Minchas Nesachim) are not Me'akev (Nesachim of) wine. The wine is not Me'akev them;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Matanos on the outer Mizbe'ach are not Me'akev each other. (Even one is Meratzeh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "U'Minchasam v'Niskeihem" - first bring the Minchah, and then the Nesachim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rebbi says, "Zevach u'Nesachim" ("Vayikra 22:37) - first bring the Zevach, and then the (wine) Nesachim (and then the Minchah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "u'Minchasam v'Niskeihem"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi uses that to permit bringing Minchas Nesachim and Nesachim at night or on another day (after the Korban was offered).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound "Zevach u'Nesachim"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They use it to teach Ze'iri's law;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> Nesachim become Mukdashim to (be brought with) a particular Zevach only when it is slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also Rebbi needs a source for Ze'iri's law. Also Chachamim need a source that one may bring Menachos and Nesachim at night or on a later day!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, Chachamim learn from "Olah u'Minchah (Zevach u'Nesachim)."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rebbi should agree with this! (This was the verse he expounded, and it puts the Minchah before the Nesachim!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, when Minchah and Nesachim accompany a Korban, all agree that we offer the Minchah first. We learn from "Olah u'Minchah";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about a Minchah and Nesachim brought by themselves;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Chachamim say, since when they are brought with a Korban the Minchah is first, it is first even without a Korban;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Rebbi disagrees. When they accompany a Korban, since we started offering something (meat) that is 'eaten' (by people and/or the Mizbe'ach), we offer other things eaten (Minchah) before offering Nesachim (which are merely poured through conduits in the Mizbe'ach);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>When they are by themselves, Nesachim have precedence, for they are accompanied by Shirah (at least when they are with a Korban, and possibly even by themselves).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THINGS THAT ARE ME'AKEV ZEVACHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Matanos on the outer Mizbe'ach are not Me'akev each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that one Zerikah on the outer Mizbe'ach is Mechaper?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "v'Dam Zevachecha Yishafech." (This connotes one putting.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The bulls, rams and lambs (of Musafim) are not Me'akev each other;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Shimon says, if Hekdesh has (money for) many bulls but Nesachim only for one, we bring only one bull. We do not bring bulls without Nesachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Which bulls and lambs does the Mishnah discuss?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It discusses those of (Musafim of) Sukos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "ka'Mishpat" regarding them. They are Me'akev each other!</p></div>
