<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>COMPARING OUR MISHNAH WITH THE MISHNAH OF FOUR OR FIVE KUPOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would Shmuel's limitation (allowing moving even four or five boxes on Shabbos only when that does not completely clear the storehouse, lest he come to smooth the newly uncovered earth) apply to our Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>On the one hand, perhaps Shabbos is more stringent than Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>On the other, perhaps monetary loss is even more cause for leniency than Bitul Beis Medrash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would R. Nachman's restriction in our Mishnah (prohibiting moving from one roof to another, even on the same level) apply to the Mishnah in Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>On the one hand, we need not protect Shabbos from disrespect to the same extent as Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>On the other, it should certainly apply where there is no loss involved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would the Chumra in our Mishnah of not lowering the fruit by means of a rope or using a ladder apply to the Mishnah in Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>On the one hand, perhaps it would be permitted if there were Bitul Beis Medrash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>On the other, perhaps an instance where there is no monetary loss would be even more stringent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to all of the above):</span> Teiku</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MOVING AN ARTICLE FOR THE SAKE OF A MUKTZAH ARTICLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> The permission to cover fruit in our Mishnah extends even to a pile of bricks.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> The permission only applies to fruit which may be moved on Yom Tov, but one may not move a vessel to cover something which may itself, not be moved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (on Ula):</span> Our Mishnah says fruit implying but not a row of bricks!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana mentions fruit because of the Reisha.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (again on Ula):</span> Were it true that bricks could be covered, then the Tana who listed wine barrels taught less than his intended Chidush!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kadei Yayin and Kadei Shemen add the case of covering Tevel, which is forbidden and therefore the same as a row of bricks.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana might include them anyway, even if they are not Tevel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Barrels would come to permit covering even where the loss is relatively small.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (on R. Yitzchak):</span> The Mishnah permits placing a vessel underneath a leak!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This speaks of a leak which is fit for an animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa permits placing a mat on top of bricks!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This speaks of bricks which remain after the building has been completed, (fit for seating).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa permits placing a mat on top of stones (that are designated for building purposes)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This speaks of stones that have been sharpened, and are fit for use in a bathroom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa permits placing a rain-cover on a beehive (provided that he does not intend to thereby trap the bees)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This speaks where there is honey in the hive.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about in the rainy season when there is no honey (and yet the Beraisa permits protecting the hive from both sun and rain)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He always leaves two honeycomb loaves inside the hive as food for the bees for the duration of winter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the Beraisa should not permit covering them with a mat!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It speaks of a case where the owner had in mind to take them for himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then what would be the Halachah had he not designated the loaves to be taken?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It would be Asur to move the mat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the Beraisa should have made that distinction within its permission to cover the hive with a mat!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is <i>prohibiting</i> all cases except when he does not intend to trap.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE ABOVE DISCUSSION IN LIGHT OF R. YEHUDAH AND R. SHIMON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We are forced into an inconsistency whereby the Reisha of the honeycomb Beraisa is R. Yehudah (who considers the Muktzah issue) while the Seifa is R. Shimon (who permits the unintended outcome [trapping] of a permitted act [protecting the honey loaves])!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is the view of R. Yehudah, and the case is where the hive has a window (preventing the bees from being trapped) and thus should the Beraisa be read.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that prohibition is obvious!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have permitted trapping creatures which one does not, as a rule, tend to trap.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>R. ASHI RESPONDS TO QUESTION 2:o ABOVE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> The language of the Beraisa may be understood to refer not to the seasons of rain and sun, but to times of rain and sun!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>At both times (sun-Tishrei and rain-Nisan) there is also honey in the hive.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>GRAF SHEL RE'IY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It is permitted to (even repeatedly) empty and replace the bucket.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rabah instructed Abaye to bring his bed into his disintegrating mill, thus permitting its removal as a Geraf Shel Re'i.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> But one may not intentionally create a Geraf Shel Re'i!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Abaye's mill caved in and he declared that it served him right for contravening his Rebbe's orders.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may take out a Geraf Shel Re'i as well as returning the empty pans with water in them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>His students assumed that the pans could be moved, but the Re'i could not be moved directly.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The Beraisa wherein R. Ashi permitted carrying the mouse disproves this understanding.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MISHNAH: SHABBOS VS. YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>All categories of prohibitions (Shevus, Reshus and Mitzvah, each as enumerated) apply to Yom Tov and all the moreso to Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Only Ochel Nefesh distinguishes Yom Tov from Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>RATIONALE FOR THE PROHIBITIONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Climbing a tree on Shabbos or Yom-Tov may lead one to break off branches.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shall we infer from the riding prohibition that Techumim are d'Oraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Not necessarily, riding might lead one to break off a twig from a tree to use as a whip.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Swimming may lead one to fashion a swimmer's barrel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Hand-clapping and dancing may lead one to fashion a musical instrument.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is judging not a permitted Mitzvah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are speaking when there is a greater expert than oneself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Betrothal should be considered a Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are speaking where one is already married and has children.</p></div>
