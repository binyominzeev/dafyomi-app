<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ALLOCATING RESOURCES TO MANKIND</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Tachlifa):</span> One must allocate his resources with care since they are predetermined (on Rosh Hashanah), with the exception of outlays for Shabbos and Yom Tov which are allocated according to the amount spent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the annual allocation?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> The Pasuk Tik'u ba'Chodesh... (as expounded) and Ki Chok (alluding to one's allocation, as indicated in Bereishis 47:22) l'Yisrael Hu.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra):</span> The Pasuk Hatrifeini Lechem Chuki.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CONDUCT REGARDING FOOD FOR SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Shamai ha'Zaken would always allocate the best item in his possession for Shabbos, eating the second best during the week.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Hillel ha'Zaken would eat the food he found each day, dedicating himself to Hash-m (Baruch Hash-m Yom Yom).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This is supported by the Beraisa in which Beis Shamai advocate honoring Shabbos from the first day of the week, and Beis Hillel relying on Baruch Hash-m Yom Yom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chama bar R. Chanina):</span> One need not notify his friend of a gift which he has given him (as Hash-m did not notify Moshe of the radiance which He had bestowed upon him).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that one must notify (based on Hash-m notifying the People of the gift of Shabbos) e.g. a parent must be notified when bread has been given to a child!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A gift which will become known does not require notification; unlike a gift which will not become known.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Shabbos will become known (when the People are commanded in its performance)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Its reward would not become known.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does one notify the parent of food having been given to a child?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One puts traces of oil and blue color on the child (prompting the parent to ask and the child to reveal the gift).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about nowadays when such practices might alert concern for witchcraft?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> One smears some of the given food onto the child.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE GIFT OF SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan citing R. Shimon b. Yochai):</span> All Mitzvos were given to the People in public except Shabbos (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then how can the Gentiles be held accountable for not having accepted it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mitzvah was publicly announced, but not its reward.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> The reward was also announced, but not the Neshamah Yeseirah (as taught by Resh Lakish).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>USING BREAD FOR ERUV TAVSHILIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One may not fulfil the requirement of Eruv Tavshilin with bread (only with a cooked dish).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is bread insufficient?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He needs the reminder of that which is Melafes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Daysa is a cooked dish which is not Melafes (as indicated by R Zeira's comment regarding the practice of eating bread with Daysa) and yet it may be used for an Eruv!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must use something out of the ordinary for the Eruv, and bread is too common.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Alternate Rendition of Above:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Cooked dish, not bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We require something unusual.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Daysa is unusual yet it may <i>not</i> be used for the Eruv!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We require that which is Melafes (a cooked dish and not bread), and Daysa is not Melafes (as per R. Zeira's comment).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MINIMAL ERUVEI TAVSHILIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> The lentils which remain at the bottom of the cooking pot suffice for the Eruv Tavshilin, provided that they combine to a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> The same applies to the fats which may be scraped off the knife.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>BISHUL AKUM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Asi citing Rav):</span> Small salted fish are not under the prohibition of Bishul Akum (since they may be eaten without cooking, as they have been salted).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> If a Gentile fried them, a Jew may use them for Eruv Tavshilin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If the Gentile makes Kasa d'Harsena from these fish, then it becomes a Davar Chashuv and is prohibited.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is obvious (since the flour in the Kasa d'Harsena cannot be eaten in its raw form)!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have permitted it by considering the fish as the Ikar (which it is not).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>K'ZAYIS FOR EACH PARTICIPANT IN THE ERUV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> An Eruv Tavshilin requires a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is that a k'Zayis for the Eruv or for each person relying on that Eruv?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A k'Zayis for the Eruv as R. Aba taught, citing Rav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah implies that even <i>less</i> than a k'Zayis may remain and the Eruv would still be valid!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Mishnah means that a k'Zayis remains (and it is called a Kol Shehu relative to the whole dish or loaf from which this k'Zayis originated).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that an Eruv may be made of many varieties, and <i>has no Shiur</i>!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means no maximum Shiur (but R. Aba is correctly citing Rav regarding the minimum Shiur).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>AWARENESS OF THE ERUV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna citing Rav):</span> An Eruv requires Da'as.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> While surely the one making the Eruv must be aware; does the one benefiting from the Eruv also require Da'as!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Da'as is not needed as we find that Amoraim would make an Eruv for their entire towns.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yakov b. Idi would proclaim that anyone who had not made an Eruv might rely on his.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Until what distance may one rely on it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nechumi b. Zechariah citing Abaye):</span> Until the limits of the Techum Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Shmuel assured the blind man that he could rely on Shmuel's Eruv and need not be sad that he forgot to make his own.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>When the same omission occurred on the following year, Shmuel considered the person to be negligent and did not permit his reliance on Shmuel's Eruv.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>OTHER ERUVIN ON YOM TOV-EREV SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> One may not make Eruvei Techumin or Chatzeros on Yom Tov (it appears like Tikun).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> Eruvei Chatzeros may be made, but not Eruvei Techumin (since we prohibit him only from making that Eruv which would allow him to do on Shabbos that which he cannot do today, on Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Halachah follows the Tana Kama.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the Halachah like Rebbi to permit Eruvei Chatzeros or to prohibit Eruvei Techumin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is obvious, since Rebbi is coming to be lenient!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The doubt arose as a result of the message sent by R. Elazar to Bavel that they should not teach that Rebbi permits and Chachamim prohibit, but the opposite, and now we wonder what Shmuel intended!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may infer from that which R. Tachlifa b. Avdimi did in accordance with the ruling of Shmuel (and about which Rav disagreed, referring to the ruling as a Kilkul).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely Rav would not have referred to the ruling as a Kilkul if it were l'Chumra.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This implies that Shmuel must have understood Rebbi to be l'Kula!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>No, a Kilkul could be caused by the Chumra (not permitting Eruvei Chatzeros) leading people to transgress when they carry on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava citing R. Chisda citing R. Huna):</span> The Halachah is like Rebbi, meaning l'Chumra!</p></div>
