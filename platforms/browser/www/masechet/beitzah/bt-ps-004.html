<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE TANA OF LITRA KETZI'OS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Tana of Litra Ketzi'os holds that even a d'Rabanan is not Batel, and certainly not a Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Meir taught the Machlokes R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(R. Eliezer) We view the upper part of the barrels as separate from the lower part, adding up to 101 for Bitul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> There need to be 100 Kelim of Chulin to be Mevatel the one with Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah taught the Machlokes differently:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> There need to be 100 barrel openings for Bitul (but the bottoms are Kosher).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> There can be no Bitul since the openings are sold by number (even though we are dealing with Terumah d'Rabanan).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>All agree that there is Bitul if the Litra Ketzi'os is packed into an unknown Igul.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that is the very question at hand!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> We mean that it is in an unknown <i>part</i> of the Igul.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>R. ASHI'S ANSWER TO WHY THE SAFEK EGG IS PROHIBITED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> The Safek regarding the egg is indeed a Safek d'Rabanan (Safek Yom Tov Safek Chol), but it is a Davar she'Yesh Lo Matirin which is never Batel.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE VIEW OF R. ELIEZER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Acheirim citing R. Eliezer):</span> An egg and its mother may be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What type of chicken are we speaking of?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A chicken designated to be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then it is obvious (R. Eliezer would not need to teach us that Beis Shamai permits the chicken - he need only have mentioned the egg)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a chicken designated for laying eggs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then both the chicken and eggs are Asurim (R. Eliezer disagrees with Beis Shamai and he holds of Muktzah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> R. Eliezer means that an egg laid on Yom Tov may be eaten along with the chicken.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Under what circumstances would this be the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> In a case of an undesignated chicken whose designation is discovered retro- actively (he either slaughters it thus demonstrat- ing that it was for eating, permitting its egg, or he leaves the chicken which then remains Muktzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Mari):</span> The chicken was always designated for eating and R. Eliezer mentioned the chicken for emphasis (Guzma) in his dispute with Beis Hillel.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This can be demonstrated from the additional phrase of R. Eliezer's cited by Acherim that not only can the egg and chicken be eaten, but also the chick and its shell.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is meant by its shell!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means its shell, literally.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But a shell is not edible!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means the chick while still in its shell.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But even the most lenient position (Rabanan who argue with R. Eliezer b. Yakov) only permit a chick once it has hatched!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A chick and its shell is a Guzma, as is the expression it and its mother.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SHABBOS ADJACENT TO YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> An egg laid on one is prohibited on the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is permitted on the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Rav contradicting himself and holding that the two days are Kedushah Achas!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav ruled like the four elders (an Eruv may be set for Shabbos and separately for its neighboring Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>These elders follow the view (of R. Eliezer) that Shabbos and Yom Tov are Shtei Kedushos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav and R. Yochanan are arguing over Hachanah (Rav subscribes to Hachanah d'Rabah and prohibits the egg which was prepared on a Yom Kodesh while R. Yochanan permits it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This echoes the Machlokes Tanaim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> The egg laid on Shabbos is permitted on Yom Tov, and the reverse.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing R. Eliezer):</span> Such an egg is also subject to the Machlokes Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Ada b. Ahavah was asked if eggs laid on Yom Tov may be prepared for Shabbos or if they are Muktzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Ada inferred that the questioner (correctly) assumed that the eggs would be permitted on Shabbos (like R. Yochanan), and his only question was regarding their Muktzah status on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He ruled that, still, they are Muktzah (and only permitted on Shabbos, as in the cited Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Papa was asked on Shabbos whether eggs laid that day would be permitted tomorrow on Yom Tov, and he asked the petitioner to return the next day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He put off his ruling owing to his having drunk wine.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Papa was pleased that he had not jumped to rule, in error, with the rule that the Halachah is like R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>In fact the Halachah is like Rav in three cases (this being one) and not like R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>USING BRANCHES ON YOM TOV WHICH FELL DOWN ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Such branches may not be burned on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan, rhetorically):</span> Then why is the egg permitted!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The fact that the egg (which could, in theory, be used on Shabbos) is prohibited on Shabbos signals that there is no Heter on Yom Tov for an egg laid that day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>However, the branches which fell on Shabbos are always prohibited and their use on Yom Tov may lead people to be lenient with branches which fell on Yom Tov itself.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>IF BRANCHES FELL INTO THE OVEN ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Masnah):</span> If branches fell directly into the oven, one may be Mevatel them with other branches (so that the majority of the heat derives from permitted branches).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But when he turns the coals, he will be moving Muktzah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The majority determines that he is moving Heter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it is not permitted to be Mevatel Isur l'Chatchilah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only in a d'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the branches are a Davar she'Yesh Lo Matirin (recalling R. Ashi's teaching) and should never be Batel!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only Isur b'En, not where it has been burnt to coals.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>ANOTHER DISPUTE OF RAV'S REGARDING AN EGG</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> An egg laid on the first day of Yom Tov is permitted on the second (Chutz la'Aretz-Ma Nafshach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> It is prohibited.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is R. Asi contradicting himself, given that we know that he said Havdalah between one day of Yom Tov and the next (so he must not hold Kedushah Achas)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Asi conducted himself stringently (prohibiting the egg and also reciting Havdalah) out of doubt whether it is one Kedushah or two.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> R. Asi seems to be correct, given our contemporary practice of making two days of Yom Tov even when our calendars are accurate.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Rav is correct (two Kedushos) given that we have two days only in the times and places which are plagued by Kusim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then why, today, do we have two days?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because R. Elazar ruled that those in Bavel should maintain this practice, lest the calendar again be lost due to oppression.</p></div>
