<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: CRUSHING SPICES AND SALT ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> Spices may be crushed in a wooden pestle (not the usual stone), while salt must be crushed in earthenware, using a wooden spoon as the hammer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> There is no change required for crushing spices while salt requires a wooden pestle.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SALT AND SPICES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does crushing salt require a Shinuy (according to both opinions)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Huna and R. Chisda):</span> Either because one should have anticipated the need for salt (which is needed for any dish, unlike other spices) or because the flavor of salt, unlike other spices, does not deteriorate if it were crushed before Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When will the reason make a difference?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he knows what dish he will cook on Yom Tov (then the first reason will require him to anticipate that need while the second would not, since the spice would deteriorate).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The spice Morika which does not deteriorate (like salt) but which he could not anticipate needing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> Salt and spices (anything which is crushed) may be crushed normally on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we learned in our Mishnah that even Beis Hillel agrees that salt requires a Shinuy!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Not if we follow R. Meir who learns that the Machlokes only applies when salt is ground separate from the other spices, whereas if they are ground together, all agree that it is done normally.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> If ground separately, the salt must be ground in earthenware, and then only a small amount (enough for broiling meat).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel)::</span> Any grinding is permitted (and even without a Shinuy).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> <i>Any</i> utensil, even a Muktzah utensil!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We meant any quantity, not any utensil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Acha Bardela to his son):</span> Even though I hold like Shmuel, please make a small Shinuy (tilt the pestle from its upright position) when hammering.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Sheshes was certain that the sound of pounding was not coming from his home since he had instructed the members of his household not to use stone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they tilted the pestle!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It would not give off this clear ring.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the sound is coming from spices, not salt (and it could still emerge from R. Sheshes' home)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Spices make a different sound when ground.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TISNI AND KESISHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not prepare Tisni and one may not grind wheat (Kesishah) in a Machteshes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The implications of the two parts of that statement seem to contradict one another (the first implying that Tisni is a problem owing to the Tircha involved while the second implies that any Kesishah is not permitted)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is only adding the reason for prohibiting the preparation of Tisni (Kesishah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the Beraisa should have sufficed with the prohibition on Kesishah in a Machteshes!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need both statements lest we permit preparing Tisni in a small Machteshes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But a Beraisa permits a small Machteshes!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Our previous Beraisa also means to prohibit only a large Machteshes (and the Beraisa is prohibiting Tisni even in a small Machteshes, and other spices in a large Machteshes).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> One Beraisa speaks in Bavel (where Kesishah in a small Machteshes is permitted) and one speaks in Eretz Yisrael (where the presence of Jewish servants necessitated prohibiting all Kesishah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Papi did not eat the wheat dish in the home of Mar Shmuel on Yom Tov (presuming that they used a large Machteshes).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they used a small Machteshes?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was too finely ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they ground it before Yom Tov?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Its color spoke to its being freshly ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> Mar Shmuel's home had unruly servants.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: BORER ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> One must remove the food from the refuse, and consume it right away.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> One may separate normally even with the help of a cloth in his lap, a Kinon and a Tamchui (but he may not use a sifting utensil).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Gamliel):</span> He may soak the lentils and discard the debris which floats to the top.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>OCHEL FROM PESOLES UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Gamliel):</span> Beis Hillel permits taking the refuse out of the food when the food is of greater quantity than the Pesoles, but if the Pesoles is the majority then he must remove the Ochel and leave the Pesoles.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But if the Pesoles is the majority then the whole mixture is Muktzah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Gamliel is speaking where there is more Ochel than Pesoles but it is more work to remove the Pesoles than the Ochel (in which case one should remove the Ochel, even though it is the minority).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>SOAKING THE LENTILS AND CAUSING SEPARATION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One Beraisa teaches that the Ochel rises to the top of the water and the Pesoles sinks while our Mishnah implies the opposite?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It depends on the type of Pesoles.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>MISHNAH: GIVING GIFTS ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> One may only give ready to eat food gifts on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> One may even send that which requires extensive preparation (such as livestock and raw ingredients).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One may not send grain (given that Tochen is prohibited).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> Even wheat is permitted (as one may be Koshesh in a small Machteshes and cook the dish).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>SENDING GIFTS IN QUANTITY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yechiel):</span> One may not send a gift in a public manner such as with a line of carriers (which, the Beraisa teaches, is at least three people).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Ashi):</span> What if each of the three are carrying a different gift?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Teiku.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Shimon permits grain on account of their other potential uses (what, barley, lentils each have uses).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>MISHNAH: OTHER TYPES OF GIFTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Garments, whether stitched or not stitched or even with Shatnez, may be sent, so long as they have a Yom Tov use.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One may not send a nailed sandal (which may not be worn on Yom Tov), nor an unstitched shoe (which cannot yet be worn).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> An undied shoe may not be sent given that a craftsman still needs to dye it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>As a rule, that which one may benefit from on Yom Tov may be sent.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>KIL'AYIM GARMENTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Of what use are Shatnez garments?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They may be folded as a seat cushion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that even though this is permitted by the Torah, Chazal forbade it!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is permitted if there is something intervening.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Shimon b. Pazi citing R. Yehoshua b. Levi citing R. Yosi b. Shaul citing Rebbi citing the holy community of Yerushalayim taught that even ten mattresses intervening would not permit one to sleep on Shatnez!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are speaking then of a Shatnez curtain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Ula taught (in regards to Tum'ah) that the attendant sometimes warms himself by the curtains!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are speaking of stiff garments which do not warm the person (as taught by R. Huna bar R. Yehoshua that one may sit on stiff garments of Shatnez).</p></div>
