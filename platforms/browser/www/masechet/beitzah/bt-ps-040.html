<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: TECHUMIN OF FOODS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If one's food is outside of his Techum, those who made an Eruv to come to his Techum may not transport his food on his behalf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he had made an Eruv to go to his food, they may bring his food to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One may not send back food with guests whose arrival was made possible by their having made an Eruv, unless the host made them the owner of the food before Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TECHUMIM IN CASES OF SHEMIRAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The food being watched has the Techum of the Shomer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It has the Techum of its owner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are Rav and Shmuel here being consistent with their positions regarding the case of one who brings his animal into the Chatzer of another, with his permission!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Huna cites Rav as ruling like the Chachamim, who obligate the owner of the Chatzer in damages done by the animal (and likewise the Techum follows the Shomer).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Shmuel rules like Rebbi who exempts the owner of the Chatzer until he explicitly indicates that he is accepting liability (and likewise the Techum remains that of the owner).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Each could maintain his position regarding the Shomer according to both positions in Bava Kama.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Even Rebbi will agree that the fruit follows the Techum of the trustee since he explicitly accepted liability.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Even Rabanan will hold that the fruit follows the Techum of the depositor since it depends on whether the owner desires that the liability (and the consequent Techum) should pass to the Shomer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (on Rav):</span> Then why, in our Mishnah, should the Eruv made by the owner of the fruit affect its Techum when it is in the home of the Shomer!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Huna):</span> The corner of the house where the food was stored had been designated as the property of its owner (and the food thus remains bound by its owner's Techum).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (on Rav):</span> Why should it help to give the food to the guests (via a third party) before Yom Tov since it remains in his trusteeship when Yom Tov begins!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here, too, it is as if he designated the place where the food is stored as the property of the guests.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> The procedure of transferring it to their ownership (entirely so that they may take it home) changes the picture.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A SEEMINGLY RELATED INCIDENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Huna only permitted R. Chana to take the meat home if he himself had hung it on the door.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Huna, a student of Rav, surely held that in any case it would be restricted to the Techum of the Shomer (his hosts)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The hosts merely gave him a place to hang his meat, like those who had designated the place above.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But why, if they hung it, should he not be able to take it!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(R. Hillel of R. Ashi) What about the implication of the Halachah of Shmuel that the Techum follows the one for whom the food is to be designated.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(Ravina of R. Ashi) We were taught that the Halachah follows R. Dosa (where we allow for assumptions about whose Techum should prevail).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(R. Ashi of R. Kehana) The Mishnah taught that animals and utensils follow the owner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the issue was unrelated to Techum, but to the rule of Basar sheNis'alem (and had R. Chana not hung the meat himself he would not have a Siman that it was his).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: GIVING WATER TO AND SLAUGHTERING ANIMALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may not water and slaughter Midbariyos, only Baysos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Baysos overnight in the town while Midbariyos remain in the pasture overnight.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE REFERENCE TO WATERING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the watering mentioned here?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For the incidental teaching that such pre- Shechitah drinking eases the flaying.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>REBBI'S VIEW ON MIDBARIYOS AND BAYSOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana of the Beraisa):</span> Midbariyos are those which leave after Pesach and return only with the first rains while Baysos return each night to the Techum of the city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> The above are both Baysos since Midbariyos are those which never return from their grazing grounds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimon b. Rebbi of his father):</span> This seems to be a Muktzah issue, Rebbi does not hold of Muktzah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is evidenced by Rebbi's answer employing the opinion of R. Shimon who does not hold of Muktzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The question pertained to dates which must be placed in palm baskets to ripen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rebbi had replied that, in Rebbi Shimon's opinion, they are not Muktzah, because only figs and grapes that one placed on the roof to dry to become dried figs and raisins are Muktzah (while these dates were never fit to eat and cannot be considered pushed out of one's mind).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">40b----------------------------------------40b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>There are three possible answers to this question:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Midbariyos are like the figs and grapes and should be considered pushed away given that they are unfit (since he has sent them away).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi said to his son only the opinion of R. Shimon, not his own ruling.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He holds like R. Shimon but in the Beraisa he was speaking to the Rabanan who disagreed with him and he was asking them to concede that those animals that come in from their grazing grounds when the first rains arrive, would not be Muktzah (even according to R. Yehudah).</p></div>
