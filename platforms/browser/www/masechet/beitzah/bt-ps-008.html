<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>BEIS HILLEL'S CONCESSION REGARDING KISUY HA'DAM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zerika citing R. Yehudah):</span> Beis Hillel only permits the use of earth which had been dug (Deker Na'utz) from before Yom Tov (and only needs to be lifted out), but not that the Aseh of Kisuy overrides the Lav of Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But he needs to crumble the dirt (Meleches Kesishah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya b. Ashi citing Rav):</span> The earth was already soft, not needing to be pulverized.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But he is making a crevice (Guma, which is Meleches Boneh)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As R. Aba taught that making a Guma where he does not need one is Patur (it is Kilkul, not Tikun).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE ASHES OF A KIRAH ARE CONSIDERED MUCHAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does this statement relate to the discussion of the Mishnah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The Tana is raising the new matter, that the ashes of a Kirah are not Muktzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Rav):</span> Only ashes made before Yom Tov are not Muktzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>New ashes are also permitted if they are still hot enough to harden an egg and they may be used for Kisuy ha'Dam (for which they were not designated).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is supported by a Beraisa, which adds that a mound of earth intended for later spreading (as a flooring) is also considered Muchan for Kisuy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Even a small undesignated mound may be used for anything, including Kisuy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra citing the elder):</span> This is provided that he designated its place.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah must not subscribe to R. Yehudah's permission, since it does not permit Kisuy on a Koy.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If that bothers you, then ask why the Mishnah does not allow Kirah ashes or a Deker!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Clearly, we are speaking where he does not have any dirt available.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here, too, he does not have a mound!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then why does the Mishnah speak of a Koy (whose Kisuy is a Safek) if its Din could be taught by a Chayah (which is a Vadai)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana is teaching the form of a "not only."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A Chayah must not be slaughtered if dirt is not available.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Even a Koy, whose Kisuy is only a Safek (and might be permitted owing to Simchas Yom Tov), must not be slaughtered on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Seifah (by telling us that he must not do Kisuy on the blood of a Koy) implies that he <i>had</i> a way of doing Kisuy, then why <i>not</i> do the Kisuy!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The Mishnah is teaching us that the ashes of a Kirah are Muchan for Kisuy Vadai, not for Kisuy Safek (and the Tana therefore speaks of Koy).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should a person (who expects to use his earth for any purpose) not be able to use it for Dam Safek!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he is making a Guma.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that is true by a Vadai, as well!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is no Isur of Guma (like R. Aba, above).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then Koy should also be permitted!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are afraid by the Koy that he will perform Kesishah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That should prohibit a Vadai, as well!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is less reason to prohibit a Vadai.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Most times the dirt does not need to be broken.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Even if it is broken, the Aseh of Kisuy overrides the Lav of Yom Tov (which would not hold if the Aseh is a Safek as by Koy).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ASEH DOCHEH LO SA'ASEH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Aseh is only Docheh Lo Sa'aseh when it is b'Idna (he performs the Mitzvah when he violates the Lav) whereas he breaks the clump of dirt before the Kisuy!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is speaking where he breaks it simultaneous with the Kisuy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Yom Tov (which is both a Lav and an Aseh) should not be overridden by an Aseh!?</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>HACHANAH FOR A SAFEK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Chazal were not concerned (when prohibiting Kisuy on the Koy) over Kesishah, but they understood that a person only did Hachanah for a Vadai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rava is consistent with his position regarding the limitations of designation.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He taught that earth which was designated for an event which might not occur (a Safek, such as Kisuy Tzo'a) may be used for Shechitah, whereas earth designated for a Vadai (such as Shechitah) may not be used for the Safek use.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Naharblai taught that if the occurrence of the Safek is nearly certain, then the designation for one applies to the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>In Eretz Yisrael they argued whether a Koy is equated with Tzo'a, or if Koy is more certain a need than Tzo'a (and thus earth designated for Tzo'a could not be used for Kisuy Dam Koy).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>We may prove from the above citation that Rava holds that Koy is doubtful and equivalent to Tzo'a.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>ALTERNATE EXPLANATION FOR THE ISUR OF KISUY HA'DAM OF A KOY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rami bar R. Yeiva):</span> We do not permit Kisuy Dam Koy on Yom Tov lest people come to permit its Chelev (like that of a Chayah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That should then apply every day, as well!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sprinkling earth on the Dam during Chol could be interpreted as for cleaning up, not for Kisuy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then what would be the Din if one slaughtered a Koy during Chol in a place where the sprinkling could not be interpreted as cleaning up (as in a trash heap)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Additional Question:</span> Why do we instruct the Shochet to cover the Dam Koy after the Shechitah, given our concern that we might come to permit its Chelev!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, during Chol people will understand that Chazal were Machmir regarding Kisuy, but they would not make that assumption if they witness Kisuy on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>OTHER INSTANCES OF PROHIBITED KISUY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(R. Zeira):If the blood of a Beheimah were to become mixed with that of a Chayah or Of, it is Asur to do Kisuy (like the Dam of a Koy).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b. Yosiniah):</span> That prohibition only applies if one scooping of earth will not suffice for the entire mixture of blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it not obvious that if Kisuy can be done on all the blood at once that it is permitted!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have prohibited one Dekirah lest the person come to permit two Dekiros.</p></div>
