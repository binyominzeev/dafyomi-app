<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Doing Kisuy ha'Dam on Yom Tov for a bird slaughtered on Erev Yom Tov is not permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>However, separating Chalah on Yom Tov from dough kneaded on Erev Yom Tov is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Avuha d'Shmuel):</span> Separating Chalah on Yom Tov, even, from dough kneaded on Erev Yom Tov, is not permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Shmuel argue with his father (Avuha d'Shmuel)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel maintains that separating Chalah is not a Tikun for the food and is thus not included in the prohibition against separating Terumos and Ma'aseros on Shabbos and Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is because he permits eating bread (in Chutz la'Aretz) and then separating Terumah afterwards.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, Shmuel agrees that if one declared part of the bread as Chalah before eating it, it is considered Chalah and may not be eaten by non-Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is therefore included in the prohibition.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He agrees with his father that Chalah may not be separated on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: MOVING A LADDER ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> The ladder of a bird coop may not be brought from one coop to another (but it may be leaned from one window to another in the same coop).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> The ladder may even be moved from one coop to another.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE ARGUMENT CONCERNING MOVING A LADDER (FIRST VERSION)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanan b. Ami):</span> The argument applies only in Reshus ha'Rabim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> One who sees him moving his bird coop ladder with suspect him of tarring his roof.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> The ladder's specific appearance as that of a bird coop ladder reveals his true purpose.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>In Reshus ha'Yachid, however, everyone agrees that it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But anything which the Chachamim prohibited because of "Mar'is ha'Ayin" is prohibited even in the innermost rooms (R. Yehudah citing Rav)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That principle is the subject of a Machlokes Tana'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> One may spread wet clothes in the sun to dry on Shabbos, but not where people will see.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar & R. Shimon):</span> It is prohibited (even where people will not see).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE ARGUMENT CONCERNING MOVING A LADDER (SECOND VERSION)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanan b. Ami):</span> The argument applies only in Reshus ha'Yachid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> It is prohibited, because of the principle (of R. Yehudah citing Rav) that prohibitions of "Mar'is ha'Ayin" apply even in the innermost rooms.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> It is permitted (because Beis Hillel does not hold of the principle of "Mar'is ha'Ayin" in the innermost rooms).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>In Reshus ha'Rabim, however, everyone agrees that it is prohibited (because of "Mar'is ha'Ayin").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [According to the way R. Chanan b. Ami explains the Mishnah,] is that to say that R. Yehudah in the name of Rav is only in accordance with Beis Shamai?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [How to explain the Mishnah] is the subject of a Machlokes Tana'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> One may spread wet clothes in the sun to dry on Shabbos, just not where people will see.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar & R. Shimon):</span> It is prohibited (even where people will not see).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Chanan b. Ami understands the Mishnah like the Tana Kama, who does not apply prohibitions of "Mar'is ha'Ayin" to the innermost rooms, and thus explains that Beis Hillel prohibits moving a ladder in Reshus ha'Rabim, but permits it in Reshus ha'Yachid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yehudah in the name of Rav understands the Mishnah like R. Elazar & R. Shimon, who hold of the principle of "Mar'is ha'Ayin" in the innermost rooms, and thus explain that Beis Hillel permits moving a ladder in Reshus ha'Rabim and therefore permits as well in Reshus ha'Yachid.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>A BERAISA DIFFERS WITH THE MISHNAH'S VERSION OF THE ARGUMENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that the ladder of a bird coop may be brought from one coop to another.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>They only argue concerning returning the ladder to its place (Beis Shamai holds it may not, and Beis Hillel holds it may be returned).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> This applies to a ladder of a bird coop, but all agree that a ladder of an upper story is prohibited.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Dosa):</span> It may be leaned from one window to another in the same coop.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Acherim citing R. Dosa):</span> It may even be dragged (if leaning does not reach) from one window to another (but not lifted).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>R. CHIYA'S SONS' ERROR (FIRST VERSION)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Upon returning from checking their fields, the sons of R. Chiya informed their father that they had ruled in a case involving a ladder of an upper story, which they permitted to be brought to a bird coop on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Chiya told them that they were wrong and they must rescind their ruling.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>His sons thought that since R. Yehudah in the Beraisa [states that everyone] prohibits moving a ladder of an upper story, that shows that the Tana Kama [holds that Beis Hillel] permits it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They erred in that R. Yehudah in the Beraisa is <i>explaining</i> the opinion of the Tana Kama, not arguing with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This can be demonstrated from the additional phrase in the words of the Tana Kama, who state that a ladder may be brought "from a bird coop to a bird coop," and not simply that it may be brought "to a bird coop."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This implies that only a ladder of a bird coop may be used, but not a ladder of an upper story.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did the sons of R. Chiya think when they read those words?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They explain those words to mean that it is permitted to bring a ladder (even one of an upper story) to several bird coops, and not just to one bird coop (and had the Tana Kama meant to limit the allowance to a ladder of a bird coop, he would have said "a ladder of a bird coop)."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>R. CHIYA'S SONS' ERROR (SECOND VERSION)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Upon returning from checking their fields, the sons of R. Chiya informed their father that they had ruled in a case involving a ladder of an upper story, which they permitted to be leaned from one window to another window of one bird coop on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Chiya told them that they were wrong and they must rescind their ruling.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>His sons thought that R. Dosa in the Beraisa permits that which R. Yehudah prohibits (moving a ladder of an upper story from one window to another window of a bird coop -- R. Yehudah prohibits it completely, R. Dosa permits leaning it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They erred in that R. Dosa in the Beraisa is prohibiting that which the Tana Kama permits (carrying a ladder of a bird coop to another coop -- Tana Kama permits carrying it, R. Dosa permits only leaning it).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>BEIS HILLEL AND BEIS SHAMAI ON SIMCHAS YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah implies that Beis Shamai (who do not permit moving the ladder) are Machmir and Beis Hillel are Meikil regarding Simchas Yom Tov while the previous Mishnah (regarding Kisuy ha'Dam) shows the opposite.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The positions in our Mishnah must be reversed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Other possibilities would make it unnecessary to reverse the positions!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps Beis Shamai is consistent in their Chumra and the leniency in the previous Mishnah is owing to his having prepared the Deker before Yom Tov!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Perhaps Beis Hillel is consistent and the leniency regarding the ladder is only due to the ladder being obviously for bird coops, not for roof work.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The contradiction <i>could</i> be raised, however, from the later Mishnah in which Beis Shamai is Machmir (regarding the requirement to handle the birds in order to designate them for use on Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Reverse the positions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there are other possibilities!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai may be lenient by Kisuy only because he has a Deker Na'utz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel may be lenient to allow verbal designation of the birds only because the Isur is only Muktzah, not Kesishah.</p></div>
