<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: MEASURING ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> One may ask one's friend to fill his utensil with a liquid, but he may not designate a measure.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> If the utensil is a measuring cup, it should not be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Aba Shaul b. Batnis would fill his measuring utensils before Yom Tov and give them to the buyers on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Aba Shaul):</span> He would do so on Chol ha'Moed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> He would do so at all times in order to insure complete measures of the oil.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MEASURING CUPS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is meant by Aval Lo b'Midah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> One may not use a Kli designated for measuring, but one may use a Kli which is no more than a spare while R. Yehudah forbids the use of <i>any</i> measuring vessel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that set R. Yehudah l'Chumra regarding Simchas Yom Tov (and Rabanan l'Kula), the opposite of our Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To resolve R. Yehudah we must distinguish between a Kli which was not used for weighing (permitted) versus a measuring Kli where R. Yehudah is strict.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We resolve Rabanan by distinguishing between normal weekday activity (requesting an amount) and exceptional activity (requesting a filled vessel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> That he may not mention a measure by name, but he may use a measuring cup (R. Yehudah agrees that one may use a Kli ha'Omed leMidah, he only argues to prohibit a Kli ha'Meyuchad leMidah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But their positions contradict?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answers:</span> As above.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ABA SHAUL BEN BATNIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>He would also do so on the Moed to free up the daytime for learning and answering questions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He collected 300 barrels of wine from Birurei ha'Midos while his colleagues collected 300 barrels of oil from Mitzuy ha'Midos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>They brought the 300 barrels to the treasurers of Hekdesh who initially indicated that what they were doing was not necessary, and when they persisted the treasurers told them that Safek Gezel should benefit the community at large.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are such needs?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chisda):</span> Water cisterns.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Chisda took Rabana Ukva for a walk and taught him:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may not measure barley for his animal on Yom Tov (but rather he may dig a measuring cup into the barley and take it out full).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One who cooks for another may measure spices on Yom Tov in order that excess spices should not cause the food to burn.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah b. Aba citing Rav):</span> A woman may measure flour for her dough on Yom Tov to encourage her to give Chalah (one twenty-fourth) generously.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is still forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Shmuel is cited (in a Tana d'vei Shmuel) as ruling leniently!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Shmuel himself taught the Halachah l'Ma'aseh.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>RE-SIFTING FLOUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> One is not permitted to re-sift flour.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papayos and R. Yehudah b. Beseira):</span> It is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>All agree that re-sifting flour is permitted if a stone or a splinter of wood fell into the flour on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa expert taught that in such a case the stones or splinters may be removed by hand (but not by re-sifting)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Ravina objected on the grounds that removing them by hand moreso resembles Bereirah and it is preferable to re-sift the flour, which does not resemble a Melachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rava b. R. Huna Zuta taught publicly that re-sifting flour is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Nachman relayed to him that this was already well known (there were already many sieves at work in Neherda'a, re-sifting flour).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yosef taught his wife that no Shinuy was needed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Ashi's wife re-sifted flour with a Shinuy and he deferred to her practice seeing as she was the daughter of (the Halachically meticulous) Rani b. Chama she must have seen it being done so in his house.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH: REQUESTING ITEMS BY NUMBER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may ask a store-keeper for a certain number of eggs and nuts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One does so in one's own home (and thus it is not exclusively a business practice).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE BERAISA CONTRIBUTES OTHER EXAMPLES OF PERMITTED REQUESTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Other requests may be made (as listed) provided that one does not include the amount required (Sechum Midah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>(R. Shimon b. Elazar) He may not mention the price (Sechum Mekach).</p></div>
