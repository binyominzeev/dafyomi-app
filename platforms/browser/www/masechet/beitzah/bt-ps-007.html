<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ANOTHER FRAUDULENT SALE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Ami invalidated the sale where the buyer had sought fertilized eggs and the seller supplied unfertilized eggs (which cannot reproduce).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That seems obvious!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have obligated the seller only to compensate the buyer for the lower value of the unfertilized eggs under the claim that the buyer could have been understood as requesting (richer) eggs for eating, not eggs for reproducing.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>INTERPRETING RAV'S ENIGMATIC STATEMENT ABOUT EGGS (resumed)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav's statement (that an egg is completed upon exit) is alluding to the teaching of R. Yochanan that once an egg partially emerges it is permitted, even if it withdrew into the chicken and was only laid on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Alternately, Rav's statement is disputing R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>COMPLETED EGGS FOUND IN A SLAUGHTERED CHICKEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> These eggs may be eaten with milk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yakov):</span> If sinews connect the eggs, they are viewed as meat and may not be eaten with milk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who taught the statement that one who eats from the clusters of eggs (Shalal) in the chicken is Tahor (not considered to have swallowed meat)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> It could not be R. Yakov, since that would be inconsistent with his ruling that eggs connected with sinews are considered meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Perhaps Chazal only were stringent regarding the Isur of Basar b'Chalav but not regarding Tum'ah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should they not have decreed regarding Tum'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Such a Gezeirah would unduly increase the quantity of Tum'ah d'Rabanan in the world (causing an unnecessary loss to Taharos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> Perhaps the eggs to which R. Yakov referred are the Eshkol (which the Beraisa forbids) and the Shalal are nearly completed eggs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Following this approach we construct the above steps as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who taught that one who eats Eshkol of eggs is Tamei?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> It is R. Yakov who taught...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Perhaps Eshkol does not refer to the eggs, but to the Eshkol itself!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What would be the news that the Eshkol itself creates Tum'ah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might not have ruled them Tamei, like other generally non-eaten parts of the animal.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>OFFSPRING ARE BORN WHEN THE PARENTS COHABIT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Day and/or night, offspring are born at the time of day when the parents cohabit (as enumerated).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Halachic difference does it make that roosters cohabit and are born by day?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may use this information to permit an egg which is found before Alos on Yom Tov (it must have been laid before Shekiah on Erev Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could R. Mari have ruled this way given that the person <i>checked</i> the nest before Yom Tov!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may assume that he didn't check thoroughly.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The egg had emerged and withdrawn, and could then have been re-laid at night (relying on R. Yochanan that once the majority has emerged the egg is considered laid).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yosi b. Shaul citing Rav ruled that once he checked, an egg found in the pre-dawn of Yom Tov is prohibited!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav was speaking about an unfertilized egg, where no cohabitation was involved (which could be laid at night).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then how could R. Mari be certain and permit the egg, why not suspect that it was unfertilized!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case was where a male was present.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that does not prove that the egg was produced from their union!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A tradition teaches that chickens will not lay unfertilized eggs if a male is present.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> At what distance is he considered present?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Gamda citing Rav):</span> So long as his voice can be heard by day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>R. Mari permitted an egg based on the presence of a male 60 houses away.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>An intervening river nullifies the effect of a rooster.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>A bridge nullifies the effect of a river.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p>A very thin bridge does not count.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then Rav should prohibit the egg (which could have been laid day or night) even if one had <i>not</i> checked before Yom Tov!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had he not checked we would (rely on the majority and) permit the egg as having been laid by day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then we should assume that it had emerged and withdrawn and permit it even when he did check (like R. Yochanan)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan's case (the majority of an egg emerging and the withdrawing) is unlikely.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is their rationale?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The fact that each is mentioned separately.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will Beis Hillel understand the separate references?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From each I would not have inferred the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Se'or is stronger than Chametz and we might have been lenient by Chametz had only Se'or appeared.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chametz is edible and I might have been lenient regarding the non-edible Se'or.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will Beis Shamai do with R. Zeira's insight that Se'or and Chametz are the same?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All agree that they are the same regarding the amount eaten, but not regarding the amount requiring destruction (Beis Hillel does and Beis Shamai does not learn Bi'ur from Achilah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This Machlokes regarding seeing Chametz is supported by R. Yosi b. Chanina and confirmed by the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>ONE WHO SLAUGHTERS ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reishah and the Seifah provide contradictory implications regarding Beis Shamai.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>HaShochet infers that slaughtering is only b'Di'eved on Yom Tov, but l'Chatchilah, without earth, one should not slaughter on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>By saying that one should not slaughter, Beis Hillel leads us to believe that Beis Shamai permits one to slaughter even l'Chatchilah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Hillel mean to argue and teach that b'Di'eved one should not fulfill the Mitzvah of Kisuy, but that all agree that one should not slaughter l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Seifah implies that only there Beis Hillel spoke about b'Di'eved, not earlier!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The Mishnah is indeed l'Chatchilah (not as implied by ha'Shochet), teaching one who is ruling the Halachah to tell the person asking:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> to slaughter, dig and cover;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> not to slaughter without ready earth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> The would-be Shochet is told (according to Beis Shamai) to dig before the Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Are R. Yosef and Rabah arguing over the teaching of R. Zeira citing Rav?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira citing Rav):</span> One must place earth below and above the blood (proof text as analyzed).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosef would seem to subscribe to this requirement and earth must be dug prior to the Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rabah would seem to not subscribe to this requirement and he may dig after the Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> All agree to R. Zeira's Din, and the Machlokes between us is whether one may slaughter without the earth under the blood already in place.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> We are afraid to let a person dig the lower earth, lest he then decide not to slaughter.</p></div>
