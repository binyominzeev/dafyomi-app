<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>APPLYING R. YOCHANAN'S ANSWER TO OTHER CONTRADICTIONS IN THE POSITIONS OF BEIS HILLEL AND BEIS SHAMAI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A contradiction could be raised from their positions regarding the permissibility of using the Ali as a meat cutting board.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai prohibits (Kli Sh'Melachto l'Isur)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel permits (Tzorech Gufo).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This demonstrates the Chumra of Beis Shamai regarding Simchas Yom Tov, in contradistinction to our Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Reverse their positions regarding the Ali.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there are alternative explanations!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai could be relying on Deker Na'utz for their Kula in our Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel might view the Ali as a K'li.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A contradiction might be raised from their positions regarding spreading out (m'Abed) or raising (Muktzah) the hides.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Reverse their positions regarding stepping on the hides.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there are other explanations!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai could be relying on Deker Na'utz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel might be lenient here because the hide has a Yom Tov purpose.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A contradiction might be raised from their positions regarding removing the doors of the stores (where Beis Shamai prohibits their removal and Beis Hillel even permits their being replaced).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Reverse their positions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there are other explanations (Beis Hillel may not recognize Binyan and Stirah by Kelim)!?</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: DESIGNATING BIRDS FOR USE ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> One must have handled the birds before Yom Tov in order to designate them for use on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> It is sufficient to stand and state which birds are going to be taken.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DEFINING THE MACHLOKES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanan b. Ami):</span> The Machlokes only applies to the first offspring.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>These are normally left in the coop.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Shamai requires additional signs of designation to avoid Tiltul Muktzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Not so by subsequent sets of offspring, where they would agree that stating which birds will be taken would suffice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Beis Hillel require specific designation at all (let his selection on Yom Tov indicate retroactively his intent Erev Yom Tov)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Hillel does not hold of Bereirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find him holding Bereirah in the Mishnah regarding Tumas Pesachim (where the designation could be made even after the person died)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Mishnah was explained by Rabah (and by R. Oshiya) as referring only to the future status of the openings from that point onward, not retroactively.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Beis Hillel meant retroactive Tum'ah and Taharah, but a general designation by the birds is not sufficient to prevent him from changing his mind after handling a bird (resulting in Tiltul Muktzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then how is stating his intent (without handling the specific birds) sufficient!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He may make his verbal designation when he recognizes the birds before Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If, however, he is attempting to rely on his selection on Yom Tov, we would not permit it given our concern that he will handle Muktzah while making his selection.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Alternately, we are concerned that he will be disappointed with all of the available birds and (if he is not bound by his previous designation) he will go without Simchah on Yom Tov altogether.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: WHEN MIGHT THE BIRDS BE OTHER THAN THE DESIGNATED ONES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If the designated birds are black and the ones he finds are white (or the reverse), or if he designated two and finds three, they are all prohibited from use.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he designated three and finds two, they are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If they were originally within the nest and are now on the shelf in front of the coop, they are prohibited.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If, however, no other birds were around the coop before Yom Tov, then these birds are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>ASSUMPTIONS OF THE FIRST CASE OF THE MISHNAH (ROV VS. KAROV)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That case seems obvious (they are surely not the same birds if they are a different color)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have permitted the birds when he designated black birds in one nest and white birds in the other, under the assumption that they traded places (rather we give precedence to Rov over Karov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this Mishnah a support for R. Chanina who gives precedence to Rov over Karov!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It need not be, as the Mishnah may be explained (as Abaye does) where the nest has a shelf in front of it, making all (non-designated) birds just as Karov (and surely the Rov).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>DESIGNATING TWO AND FINDING THREE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Isur is based on the following Ma Nafshach:</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If these birds are all new, they are Asurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one of them is new, then it is not Batel since it is a Davar she'Yesh Lo Matirin.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>DESIGNATING THREE AND FINDING TWO</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> On what basis are these permitted?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We assume that two remained and one flew away.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this Mishnah side with Rebbi (in his argument with Rabanan, and thus against the Halachah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> One who finds 200 in a box where he placed 100 of Ma'aser must view them as a mixture of Chulin and Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> The entire 200 is Chulin (since Ma'aser funds are normally kept segregated).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> If he found 100 after leaving 200 he presumes them to be half of his Ma'aser funds.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> They are all Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>In our case, the Rabanan would, apparently, view the two remaining birds as not the same as the originally designated trio!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Rabanan could concur with our Mishnah given the teaching of R. Yochanan and R. Elazar that money is less likely to be out of its place than birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did we need to force this distinction between money and birds, if in the scenario of "two money-sacks" there is no dispute between Rebbi and Rabanan?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is a Machlokes between R. Yochanan and R. Elazar as to the case in which Rebbi and Rabanan argue.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(One view):</span> They only argue when the 200 were in two sacks of 100 each, but they would agree that it is all Chulin if they were in one sack.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(The other view):</span> They argue only when the 200 was in one sack, but if it were split then all agree that this is half of the original Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The distinction between birds (which hop) and money (which does not) is needed only according to the first view (to explain why Rabanan view both sacks as having been taken, but view only one bird as having left).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But according to the second view, the distinction is clear!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> When speaking of the 200 in one sack, they meant two sacks which were tied together, and the parallel case in our Mishnah is where the birds were tied together, as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Birds, given their motion, untie from one another.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Coin sacks, on the other hand, do not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> The tie between coin sacks also is prone to come undone (and one might inadvertently take one sack and leave the other).</p></div>
