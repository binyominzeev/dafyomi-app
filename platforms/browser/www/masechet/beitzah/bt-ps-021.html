<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SLAUGHTERING AN ANIMAL OWNED BY PARTNERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Avia):</span> May an animal owned by a Jewish and non-Jewish partner be slaughtered on Yom Tov?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Huna):</span> It is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Avia):</span> Why then are Nedarim and Nedavos prohibited owing to the part which goes LaShem!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Huna):</span> A raven flew overhead (he deflected the question).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah, R. Huna's son):</span> Given the esteem in which you hold R. Avia, why did you send him away in this way?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Huna):</span> I could not have done otherwise given my weakened state and the intricate nature of the question.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What, indeed, is the distinction between an animal owned by partners and Nedarim/Nedavos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The part owned by the non-Jew must also be slaughtered in order for the Jew to eat meat; while the meat of Nedarim/Nedavos is all from Shulchan Gavohah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BAKING A DOUGH OF PARTNERS ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> While an animal owned by a Jewish and non- Jewish partner may be slaughtered as above, such a dough would not be permitted, since it can be divided.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chana b. Chanilai):</span> But the Mishnah teaches that an Isas Kelavim (when consumed, in part by the shepherd) may be baked on Yom Tov, even though it may be divided (between the shepherd and the dogs).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Isas Kelavim may be eaten in its entirety given (Ho'il) that Neveilah can be offered to the dogs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Chisda rules that one who bakes on Yom Tov for Chol incurs Malkos, since he does not hold of Ho'il!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The dough is only viewed as being accessible by the shepherd if he actually has meat to substitute for the dough.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May we bake dough which Jews are obligated to prepare for the King's troops?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Huna):</span> If the troops will allow a portion to be given to a Jewish child, then all the breads may be baked on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches (through the incident of Shimon ha'Teimani and R. Yehudah b. Bava) that one violates Lachem if he slaughters meat for non-Jews, even though it could be given to the Jews' dogs!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Machlokes Tanaim as to whether Lachem precludes preparing for dogs (R. Yosi ha'Gelili) or non- Jews (R. Akiva).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> On what basis does R. Akiva include dogs in Lachem but exclude non-Jews?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Dogs are Lachem since they depend on their owner for food (unlike non-Jews).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> How, according to R. Yosi ha'Gelili, are we permitted to feed date-seeds to the animals (they should be Muktzah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> They are not Muktzah since they could be used as kindling.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what if they are moist?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They could still be used in a large fire.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about on Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They may be moved via a loaf of bread (as Shmuel taught that one may use bread for such purposes).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE REMAINING DROPS IN THE CUP OF A NON-JEW</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Huna (above, 2.g.) is arguing with R. Yehoshua b. Levi who forbade having a non-Jew partake of our Yom Tov meal lest the Jew prepare additional food for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Acha b. Yakov):</span> It is not permitted on Shabbos, either, because the residual wine in the cup is (Ma'us and thus) Muktzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the same should be true of our cups!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The drops in our cups are fit for the fowl.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same should be true of the non-Jews' cup?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Their wine is Asur b'Hana'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the drops should be movable via the cup (as Rava taught regarding the shovel of coals)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The pieces of wood in Rava's case are not asur b'Hana'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Acha m'Difti):</span> The drops should not be worse than a Geref Shel Re'i (which may be removed)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> But surely we would not make such a Geref on purpose (as would occur by inviting the non- Jew to partake of our meal).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We may invite a non-Jew on Shabbos but not on Yom Tov lest we cook additional food for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Mereimar and Mar Zutra would inform the non-Jewish guests who happened upon their homes that they are welcome to the meal "as is" but that no special preparation would be made for them.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: COOKING FOR NON-FOOD PURPOSES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> The water being warmed for washing one's feet must be fit for drinking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> Even non-potable water may be heated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One is permitted to make a fire and to warm himself thereby.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE PERMISSION OF MAKING A FIRE FOR WARMING ONESELF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the permitted fire the opinion of both Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel or is it taught as the opinion of Beis Hillel alone (and Beis Shamai would forbid it)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa teaches that Beis Shamai forbids.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE PRACTICES OF R. GAMLIEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Gamliel ruled stringently in accordance with three opinions of Beis Shamai:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may not be Matmin on Yom Tov for the upcoming Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One may not straighten a fallen Menorah on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One may not prepare a thick dough (only a thin batter).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Gamliel):</span> Our family would only make the thin batter, and not a thick dough.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> Your family ruled stringently for themselves and yet were lenient (permitting the thick dough) for others.</p></div>
