<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TEVILAS KLI ON EREV YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> It is not permitted to immerse a Kli (which became Tamei that day) on Erev Yom Tov during Bein ha'Shemashos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon Shezuri):</span> The same holds for any other day owing to the fact that a Kli needs nightfall after Tevilah before it can be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the Tana Kama (who seems to permit Tevilas Bein ha'Shemashos on a Yom Chol) not hold that a Kli requires He'erev Shemesh?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava citing the students of Rav):</span> The Machlokes revolves around relying on the implications of his actions (in a case where the person is running with the Kli during Bein ha'Shemashos to do Tevilah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana Kama permits on a weekday because his running demonstrates his preparedness to stop if he does not have He'erev Shemesh (but we restrict his Yom Tov activity lest he toil for naught).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon Shezuri prohibits and does not attribute his running to anything but his work pattern.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava, his own view):</span> While all concur that one's actions reveal his intent, they argue whether his demonstrated (through his question) lack of knowledge in another area (the Shiur of Tum'ah, which is not explicit) causes us to assume his lack of familiarity with He'erev Shemesh (which is in the Pasuk) as well.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>UNNECESSARY TEVILOS ARE PERMITTED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Tevilah from Gav to Gav?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One immerses his Kelim for use with wine or oil after they were already immersed for oil or wine (this Tevilah is unnecessary and thus permitted on Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Tevilah from one Chaburah to another?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Re-immersing his Kelim after doing so to eat with one Chaburah, in anticipation of eating with a different Chaburah (again, an unnecessary Tevilah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: OLOS AND SHELAMIM ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> One may bring Shelamim, without Semichah, on Yom Tov, but not Olos (which are not eaten).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> They are both brought, with Semichah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE SPECIFIC POINT OF THE MACHLOKES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> (There is no dispute that Shalmei Chagigah are brought and that Nedarim and Nedavos are not brought) the argument is whether there is Semichah by Shalmei Chagigah and whether Olos Rei'ah are to be brought.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai interprets the word Chagosem to permit Chagigah, not Olos Rei'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel interprets the word LaShem in that Pasuk to allow anything brought to Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Ada b. Ahavah affirms that Nedarim and Nedavos are not brought on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Shimon b. Elazar taught that there is agreement that non-Yom Tov Olos may not be brought and Yom Tov Shelamim are brought and they argue only about bringing Yom Tov Olos and non-Yom Tov Shelamim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa should be emended and taught in accordance with Ula.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosef):</span> Why do you insist that there can only be one position of Tanaim; let the matter be a Machlokes Tanaim, where this Tana disagrees with Ula (and allows Nedarim and Nedavos), but another Tana supports him (not permitting Nedarim and Nedavos)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> Semichah is done on Yom Tov Shelamim before Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> Semichah is done on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>All agree that Nedarim and Nedavos are not brought on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>IN SEARCH OF THE SAME MACHLOKES ELSEWHERE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The following Tanaim are similarly arguing over whether Nedarim and Nedavos are brought on Yom Tov:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> A Todah (which is Nedarim and Nedavos) may only be brought on (Chol ha'Moed) Sukos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> If a Korban may not be brought on Pesach it cannot be brought on (Shavuos or) Sukos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> A Todah may not only be brought on Sukos, but one fulfills Simchah thereby.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We analyze the Tana Kama's position in search of the reported Machlokes regarding Nedarim and Nedavos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana Kama's statement that a Todah may not be brought on Pesach because it is Chametz is obvious!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ada bar R. Yitzchak):</span> We are prohibiting bringing the Todah even on Erev Pesach (when Chametz will have to be burnt before the Korban would have to be consumed) in order to protect it from having to be burnt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Tana Kama's second statement, that the Todah cannot be brought on Shavuos because of Yom Tov establishes him as the first position, forbidding Nedarim and Nedavos on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>His third statement, that the Todah may be brought on Sukos must be speaking of Chol ha'Moed (since he just taught that it may not be brought on Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We analyze R. Shimon's position:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon appears to be prohibiting Nedarim and Nedavos even on Chol ha'Moed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If we are allowed to chop wood on Chol ha'Moed for Yom Tov needs, then certainly we are permitted to offer Nedarim and Nedavos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The discussion between Tana Kama and R. Shimon is about the timing of Bal T'acher (not about Nedarim and Nedavos on Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Tana Kama holds that the Lav is violated after three consecutive Regalim, counting from the time he made the Neder.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Shimon holds that the three Regalim in their order must pass for the person to be in violation of the Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>We analyze the position of R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He allows the Todah to be brought on Sukos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he allows it on Chol ha'Moed, then his position is the same as the Tana Kama!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He allows it on Yom Tov, and he is the second opinion in the Machlokes which R. Yosef referred to above.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But why did he single out Sukos as being permitted for bringing the Todah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To affirm his position in the Bal T'Acher discussion that Sukos alone causes the Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> Sukos is mentioned in the Pasuk which is already dealing with Sukos to teach that it is the last Regel in the sequence of three Regalim which must pass to violate the Lav (c.3.ii. above).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> Sukos alone can cause the violation (if the vow was taken just before Sukos, he would only have Sukos to fulfil his vow).</p></div>
