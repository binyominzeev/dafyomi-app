<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TRAPPING (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa teaches that one may not trap Chayos nor Ofos in a Bibar (contradicting the Mishnah regarding both Chayos and Ofos)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Chayos the two Beraisos differ regarding the positions of R. Yehudah (who only forbids birds being trapped into a tower and deer into a house, but not into a Bibar) and Rabanan (who prohibit even into a Bibar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there is still a contradiction regarding Ofos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It speaks of different types of Bibarin, one roofed and one unroofed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But both agree that one may trap a bird into a house, which should be viewed as a covered Bibar!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar R. Huna):</span> The prohibition is speaking of an undomesticated bird (Dror), as taught in the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There should be no contradiction within Chayos, either, given that one Beraisa may be speaking of a larger or smaller Bibar!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What would constitute a small or large Bibar?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> A small Bibar is where the animal may be caught with one stride.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> The presence of nooks (into which the animal may escape) makes it a large Bibar.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>R. SHIMON B. GAMLIEL LOOKS AT THE SIZE OF THE BIBAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef citing R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon b. Gamliel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Are we to infer from this "ruling" that there is a dissenting opinion?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> Why should you inquire about a dissenting opinion once you know the Halachah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> One must not learn like a fool!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AN ANIMAL WHICH IS NOT YET TRAPPED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is an animal not yet trapped?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef citing R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> If the person calls for a trap to trap the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> But we find that people call for traps when seeking certain fowl, yet the Beraisa teaches that one who traps these is Patur!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar R. Huna citing Shmuel):</span> These come back to their pens at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa speaks of pigeons which return to their place at night and yet one is Chayav for trapping them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we must say one is Patur if they come back to their pens at night <i>and</i> they depend on the owner for their food, but not if they come back but do not depend on the owner for food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Mari):</span> The prohibited birds fly away while the permitted ones do not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But all the pigeons fly up to their nests!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Some fly to their nests, while some fly away even from their nests (making it more difficult to catch them).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TAKING ANIMALS FROM THE TRAPS - MUCHAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may not take an animal from a trap on Yom Tov, unless certain that the animal was trapped before Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A Gentile brought fish to R. Gamliel who ruled them permitted (but that he did not wish to take them from this Gentile).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>SAFEK MUCHAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The cited incident contradicts the Reisha!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must insert the Halachah that Safek Muchan is a Machlokes, and the incident demonstrates R. Gamliel's lenient position regarding Safek Muchan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Gamliel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Others learn Shmuel's ruling as applied to the Machlokes between R. Gamliel (who permits Safek Muchan) and R. Yehoshua (who does not permit) and the ruling is in favor of R. Yehoshua.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Others learn Shmuel's ruling as applied to the discussion of taking animals from a trap:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> One may slaughter animals in a Bibar with water but not from a net or trap.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Elazar):</span> If he found the trap disturbed on Erev Yom Tov he may take the animal, since it surely was trapped before Yom Tov; whereas if he found it disturbed on Yom Tov he may not take it, as it was surely trapped on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But this is self contradictory, since in the first case we may take it only if we are <i>certain</i> that it was trapped before Yom Tov, yet in the second case it may be taken unless we are certain it was trapped <i>on</i> Yom Tov!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The statement means to prohibit where we are in doubt as to when it was trapped (i.e. a doubt must be viewed as though it were certainly trapped on Yom Tov whose Halachah is...).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>On this Shmuel ruled like R. Shimon b. Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>R. GAMLIEL PERMITS THE FISH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are they permitted for?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> They may be received.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Levi):</span> They may be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> My attendance in the Beis Medrash allowed me to know of Rebbi's retraction of the Heter to eat it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa permits one to receive moist fish and fresh fruit from a Gentile (while they may be received, how can these be eaten, seeing as they were just trapped or picked)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> According to your assumption, they cannot be handled either (so that we must be speaking of reddish fish and pickled fruit)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are these called fresh?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because they appear as though they are fresh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> It is not permitted to receive from a Gentile anything which may have been picked that day (i.e. these items are still attached in the fields), and they are permitted after Yom Tov (Rishon) only after Kedei she'Ya'aseh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If they are not available in the fields they are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>If they came in from outside the Techum they are prohibited, but only to the Jew for whom they were brought.</p></div>
