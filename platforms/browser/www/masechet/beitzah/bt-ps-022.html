<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>INSULATING A HEATED POT ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If an Eruv Tavshilin was made, why does Beis Shamai prohibit insulating a heated pot?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If an Eruv Tavshilin was not made, why does Beis Hillel permit it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Huna):</span> An Eruv Tavshilin was not made, but the Rabanan permitted cooking the bare minimum (R Huna is consistent with his position elsewhere).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> One who did not make an Eruv may bake one loaf, cook one dish, and kindle a single flame.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> One may even roast a small fish.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A Beraisa reflects both opinions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> An Eruv Tavshilin was made, but Hatmanah is nevertheless prohibited since it is obviously being done for Shabbos (and thus is not covered by the Eruv).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> But Chananiah teaches that one who made an Eruv Tavshilin with Hatmanah may be Matmin on Yom Tov for Shabbos (even though it is obviously for Shabbos)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Our Mishnah is rather speaking where he made an Eruv with Bishul or Afiah but not Hatmanah (and our Mishnah follows the view of Chananiah and Beis Shamai regarding the requirement that the Eruv be specific).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE PROHIBITION OF STANDING UP THE (FALLEN) MENORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Isur is involved?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chinena b. Bisna):</span> We are speaking of a Menorah whose couplings came apart when it fell, and the assembly looks like Boneh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai prohibits this assembly since they hold that Boneh applies to Kelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel permits this assembly since Boneh only applies to Karka, not to Kelim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MAV'IR AND MECHABEH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Ula's servant tipped a candle, distancing the oil from the wick, which would extinguish the candle.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehudah):</span> But the Beraisa teaches that one who adds oil is Chayav for Mav'ir and one who removes oil is Chayav for Mechabeh!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> I was unaware of my servant's activity.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> It is permitted to remove the charcoal on the end of the wick on Yom Tov (Kanva).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Aba Marta):</span> Is one permitted to extinguish a flame on Yom Tov to provide the darkness required for conjugal relations?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is not a Tzorech ha'Yom since he may use another home.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> And what if no other home is available?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He may construct a Mechitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What if a Mechitzah is not possible?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He may cover the flame with a Kli.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What if no Kli is available?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mechabeh is forbidden even if it is Tzorech ha'Yom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that Tzorech ha'Yom <i>does</i> permit Kibuy (extinguishing the flame so that there is less smoke)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> That Beraisa is the view of R. Yehudah, who permits Melachos l'Tzorech ha'Yom, while I was speaking in the view of Rabanan (which is l'Halachah) who only permit Melachos for Ochel Nefesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye, before he learned from Rabah that Melachos which are not for Ochel Nefesh are not permitted):</span> Is it permitted to put out a fire on Yom Tov?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>When the situation is life-threatening there is no question that Kibuy is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The question relates to a situation of monetary loss.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> It is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> But the Beraisa that for a great need one is permitted to be Mechabeh!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa is the view of R. Yehudah...</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MEDICINAL PAINTING OF THE EYE ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Ashi):</span> Is it permitted to apply the medicinal paint around one's eye on Yom Tov?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We assume that none of the dangerous conditions listed are present and the condition is abating.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One wishes the treatment in order to fully open his eye.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> It is prohibited.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa...?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa is R. Yehudah...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Ameimar permits applying the paint by a non-Jew on Shabbos when there is no danger (alternately, he had his own eye painted by a non-Jew on Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Ashi):</span> The bases for permitting such an act are premised on the Jew not assisting the non-Jew in the procedure, whereas you are helping it along by opening and shutting your eye!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> Assisting (where the act could have been done by the principle person alone) is not significant (as I told R. Zevid who asked the same question).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Ameimar permitted the painting on the second day of Rosh Hashanah (when Melachah is prohibited d'Rabanan, even by a Jew).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Ashi):</span> But Rava only taught a leniency on the second day of Rosh Hashanah when the honor of a deceased is at stake!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> I rule in accordance with those who include Beitzah among the leniencies.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> And why might you assume stringency?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Out of concern that Elul was truly 30 days and the "true" Rosh Hashanah is on the second day!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But R. Chinena b. Kehana taught that since the days of Ezra, Elul never had 30 days.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>BAKING WITH A THICK OR THIN DOUGH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> We may not bake a Pas Avah on Pesach (presumably, out of concern for Chimutz).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> It is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How thick is Pas Avah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Huna):</span> A Tefach (as the Lechem ha'Panim were a Tefach thick and was still considered Matzah, not Chametz).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosef):</span> But here are five reasons (listed) why the Lechem ha'Panim could be permitted while being a Tefach thick which would not apply to any other case!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah b. Aba citing his Rebbi [Rav] or it was Rav citing Rebbi):</span> The Pas Avah which Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai argue over is a large quantity at once.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a large quantity called "thick?"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because it is "thick" when kneaded.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> That is how they referred to a large quantity of bread in the place of that Tana.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the issue involved is the excessive effort on Yom Tov, then why does the Tana speak of Pas Avah on Pesach (as opposed to any other Yom Tov)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It only happens that this Tana was speaking about the Halachos of Pesach (as the Beraisa affirms that the Machlokes of Pas Avah applies on any Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>MISHNAH: R. GAMLIEL'S LENIENCIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may sweep the dining room (without concern for leveling the crevices in the floor).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One may place incense to be burned on the coals (even though it is not for Ochel Nefesh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One may roast the Gedi whole on Pesach night (without concern that it may look like the Korban Pesach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Chachamim prohibit each of the above.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>INCENSE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> They only argue about incense for perfuming a garment, not for bringing fragrance into a room.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But from the Beraisa (based on the first cases of the Mishnah) we see (from the challenge of Chachamim to R. Eliezer b. Tzadok) that R. Gamliel <i>permits</i> Kibud and Gimur on Yom Tov and Chachamim prohibit it (not like R. Asi's assertion)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must learn the comment of R. Asi as teaching that they only argue about Gimur for aroma but agree that perfuming a garment is prohibited.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>SMOKING FRUITS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one place Levonah on coals to smoke fruit?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah b. Aba citing Rav):</span> It is prohibited (the act extinguishes the coals for a cause which is not Shaveh l'chol Nefesh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Answer (Shmuel) It is permitted (the smoking is Shaveh l'chol Nefesh but for the fact that many cannot afford the Levonah to do so).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna, explaining Rav):</span> It is prohibited due to Mechabeh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Nachman):</span> Why not point to the Mav'ir of the Levonah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mechabeh happens first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The problems only begin when using coals, but placing Levonah on a hot vessel is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> That, too, is prohibited due to Molid.</p></div>
