<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE PROHIBITION OF USING A SCALE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(R. Yehudah) One may weigh meat against a vessel whose weight he knows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>(Chachamim) One may not pay any attention to a scale at all.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>VARIOUS HALACHOS REGARDING SELLING MEAT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is intended by "at all?"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> One may not use the scale even if only to guard food from mice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Idi b. Avin):</span> The prohibition only applies if the scale is hanging on a peg used for weighing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> An experienced butcher may not weigh a piece of meat against a weight in his other hand nor may he use water displacement.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya b. Ashi):</span> One may not fashion a handle in a piece of meat (while Ravina permits a handle which is poked with his finger, not formed with a knife).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> One may make a marking in the meat (as Raba bar R. Huna did) to ensure that the meat is not switched.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MANAH K'NEGED MANAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Chiya and R. Shimon b. Rebbi would divide meat between them by weighing a Manah against a Manah (on the scales).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But this does not fit with the view of either R. Yehudah (who only permits weighing against a known utensil) nor the Rabanan (who forbid using scales altogether)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They followed the view of R. Yehoshua (who permits weighing a Manah against a Manah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehoshua since an anonymous Mishnah in Bechoros rules like him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah in Bechoros):</span> The proceeds of Pesulei ha'Mukdashin go to Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One may weigh a Manah against a Manah when selling a Bechor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Perhaps the Mishnah in Bechoros and R. Yehoshua do not hold of one another!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehoshua's Heter of weighing a Manah against a Manah on Yom Tov might not apply to Kodoshim where we must contend with the denigration of Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Chachamim's Heter by Bechor may be restricted to a sale (which is not normally done with Maneh k'neged Maneh) but would not apply to a division between partners (which is).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is odd that R. Chiya and R. Shimon were making an accurate division altogether, given that they were not in the least fussy if one received more than the other!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> The incident should be reported by changing one of the names of the pair (as suggested).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: KNIVES ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may not use a grindstone to sharpen a knife on Yom Tov.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> A grindstone is prohibited but a wooden grinder is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> [First Lashon, qualifying the first part of R. Huna's statement] One may even sharpen the knife provided one uses a wooden sharpener while a grindstone is permitted only in order to remove the fat from the knife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> [Second Lashon, applying to the end of R. Huna's words] A wooden grinder will be permitted only to remove the fat and a stone would be entirely prohibited.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> [Third Lashon, applying to the Reisha of our Mishnah] The Heter in the Seifa of rubbing one knife against another even extends to sharpening it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> [Fourth Lashon, applying to the Seifa of our Mishnah] The Isur in the Reisha even extends to rubbing a knife on a grindstone in order to remove the fat from the knife.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE TANA OF OUR MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of our Mishnah (who forbids the use of a grindstone)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chisda):</span> It is not R. Yehudah (who permits whatever is needed for Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava of R. Chisda):</span> May you be quoted as saying that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chisda):</span> May I only be cited as saying such nice things.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nechemyah bar R. Yosef):</span> Rava conducted himself like R. Yehudah, but did not rule so publicly.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabanan):</span> It is prohibited.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> A Chacham may examine his own knife and lend it to the Shochet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> A dulled knife may be sharpened on Yom Tov, provided that it still cuts (but with difficulty).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>THE MACHLOKES BETWEEN THE RABANAN AND R. YEHUDAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda or R. Yosef):</span> The dented knife, the broken spit and the plaster-filled oven are affected by the Machlokes R. Yehudah (who permits even Machshirin) and Rabanan (who do not).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Each (R. Yehudah and Rabanan) derives his Halachah from words in the Pasuk, and learns other Halachos from the sources mentioned by the other.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>A SPIT-ROD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> A bent (but unbroken) spit may not be straightened on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is that not obvious?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have permitted it when he does not need an implement to straighten it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> A spit is Muktzah after being used for roasting.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ada b. Ahavah citing R. Malkiyo):</span> One is permitted to quickly drag it into a corner, without actually holding it properly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya b. Ashi citing R. Huna):</span> That is only permitted if a keZayis of meat remains on it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Even if a keZayis does not remain (it may be removed like a dangerous thorn in the street, which one may remove to protect people).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>CLARIFYING THE AUTHORSHIP OF R. MALKIYO AND R. MALKIYA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chinena bar R. Ika):</span> The author of Shfod, Shefachos and Gumos is R. Malkiyo while Beluris, Eifer Makleh and Gevinah was taught by R. Malkiya.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> Whatever deals with a Mishnah or Beraisa, is R. Malkiya, whatever is a Machlokes Amoraim, is R. Malkiyo (and a Siman is given to recall this).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The difference between them is Shefachos, which is a Mishnah.</p></div>
