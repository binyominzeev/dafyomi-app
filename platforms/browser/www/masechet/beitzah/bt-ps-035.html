<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SUPPORTING R. NACHMAN'S TEACHING FROM THE TANA'IM (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we can demonstrate that, according to R. Eliezer, speech alone is <i>not</i> Kove'a!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer holds that whatever may be returned to the storage bin is not Kavu'a.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One may dip olives in salt (an act which is Kove'a) yet still snack them one at a time (and they are not Nikba for Ma'aseros).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If one takes ten olives from a Ma'atan, the Tana Kama (in Ma'aseros) obligates separating Ma'aseros while R. Eliezer distinguishes between when the Ma'atan is Tahor or not.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the Ma'atan from which he removed the olives was Tahor then he is obligated.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If it was Tamei then he is Patur from Ma'aseros.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why the distinction?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are dealing with a Tamei person (who cannot return the olives to a Ma'atan which is Tahor, but may return them to a Ma'atan Tamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Thus, even the <i>action</i> of removing the olives is not Kove'a according to R. Eliezer; is there even a question about mere speech!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah is dealing with a Muktzah Tahor and a Tamei person, such that he cannot return them, and they are Nikbah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But they are already "returned" in our Mishnah (since he only spoke regarding them; he did not take any out at all and, seemingly, our Mishnah cannot regard speech as a Kove'a, and the factor which creates Kevi'us in our Mishnah must be Shabbos, thus supporting R. Nachman)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Simi b. Ashi):</span> R. Nachman cannot be supported by our Mishnah because that is the unique, position of R. Eliezer that removing Terumah from food is Kove'a (all the more so Shabbos, whose meals are Chashuv [v'Karasa laShabos Oneg]).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Chachamim (in the cited Mishnah hold that Terumah is not Kove'a.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rava asked his original question of R. Nachman according to the Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO FIND SUPPORT FOR R. NACHMAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Seifa of our Mishnah (where the Chachamim permit him to mark the fruit in the Muktzah during Shemitah) implies that, in other years of the cycle, the fruit would be forbidden, presumably because Shabbos is Kove'a, like R. Nachman!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>No, it is not Shabbos which is Kove'a according to the Chachamim, but the fact that he both designated and marked the fruit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then why speak of Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach that Tevel is Muchan on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Eliezer seems to contradict himself!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In Terumos, R. Eliezer (against R. Yehoshua) holds that if someone enters a Chatzer eating a cluster of grapes, he may continue to eat and the same applies to someone who is eating a cluster of grapes and Shabbos enters.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Yet earlier we understood R. Eliezer to teach that Shabbos is Kove'a for Ma'aseros!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah in Terumos must be understood as explained by R. Nasan (that he must exit the Chatzer and wait until after Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>R. YOCHANAN DIFFERS WITH R. NACHMAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> Shabbos, Terumah, Chatzer and Mekach each are Kove'a only that which is ready to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He specified Shabbos, in order to differ with Hillel; he mentioned Chatzer to disagree with R. Ya'akov and Terumah to disagree with R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Hillel forbade fruit that was put out to dry and Shabbos arrived.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">35b----------------------------------------35b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Ya'akov forbade the family of someone who put out fruit to dry in his Chatzer to eat of it without separating Ma'aseros.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Eliezer forbade someone who separated Terumah before the Gemar Melachah to eat from it, even casually.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He specified Mekach conforming with the Beraisa which is lenient regarding the figs of an Am ha'Aretz if figs are generally pressed (and fresh figs are thus not at Gemar Melachah), thus teaching us three Halachos:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Mekach is only Kove'a after Gemar Melachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The majority of Amei ha'Aretz tend to separate Ma'aseros.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>The obligation to separate D'mai from the produce of an Am ha'Aretz extends even to something that has not yet reached the stage when it is ready to eat (since the Tana says Me'asran D'mai (which implies a leniency), and not just Me'asran).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He specified Mekach to (side with R. Yehudah and) argue with the Tana Kama in Ma'aseros who says that if two friends exchange fruit, they are both obligated to separate Ma'aseros, irrespective of whether they both intended to eat the fruit, to put it out to dry (which renders it not ready to eat) or if one of them intends to eat it, and the other, to put it out to dry.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that only if the person who exchanged fruit intends to eat it must separate Ma'aseros, but not if he intends to put it out to dry (Mekach is only Kove'a once it is ready to eat).</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE THRESHOLD OF PERMITTED EXERTION ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may throw grain down through a skylight (but not through a window) to the floor below on Yom Tov (not on Shabbos) to protect it from the coming rain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If rain threatens to spoil one's fruit, jars of wine or oil, one may cover them with overturned vessels.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If water is dripping into one's house one is permitted to place a vessel underneath the leak (even on Shabbos) in order to keep one's house clean.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE WORDING OF THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yehudah and R. Nasan argue whether the first word of our Mishnah is Mashilin or Mashchilin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> There is a Pasuk to support one and a reference in a Mishnah to support the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman b. Yitzchak):</span> Other wordings are also correct, and each mean casting something down as we find support in various Mishnayos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE VOLUME OF GRAIN HE MAY PUSH THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> At what point will the pushing constitute undue Tirchah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira citing R. Asi):</span> Until (the amount referred to in Shabbos) four or five boxes of straw (which the Mishnah permits clearing either out of deference to the guests or because of Bitul Beis ha'Midrash).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But perhaps the limit there is higher owing to the good reasons cited for the permission!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the higher limit is due to Shabbos (where we are confident that no Zilzul will result) but would not apply to Yom Tov!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps that is a <i>lower</i> limit since no monetary loss is involved, but a higher limit would apply where the potential loss of grain is at stake!?</p></div>
