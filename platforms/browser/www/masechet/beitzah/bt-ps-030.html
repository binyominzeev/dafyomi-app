<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: PROPER CONDUCT ON YOM TOV (CARRYING QUANTITIES AND MUKTZAH)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may not transport jars of wine by putting them all into a basket or a box.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rather, one may carry a few jars in the prescribed fashion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One may not transport a box of straw slung over one's shoulder.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>He may transport it as described.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>One begins taking fuel from piles of straw rather than from the wood in storage (in the Muktzah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ALTERING (SHINUY) FOR YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When change is not possible, articles may be transported in the usual manner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rava instituted various alterations in the methods of transporting goods on Yom Tov (as listed), to the extent that alteration is possible without an increase in the labor involved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanan b. Rava):</span> How do we allow women to draw and subsequently carry, the water in the regular jars, without making a Shinuy?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> Each suggested alteration has drawbacks (as listed) leaving us with no available alteration.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MUTAV SHE'YIHEYU SHOGEGIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava b. R. Chanin):</span> Why do we overlook the violations of the Mishnah's prohibition against clapping, etc.?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The same problem should then apply to our overlooking those who sit at the opening of a Mavoy, and the answer to both is Hanach Lahem...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The principle of Mutav she'Yiheyu Shogegin does not apply to a d'Oraisa, where we must rebuke the Shogegin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The principle applies to a d'Oraisa, as well, as we see from our silence regarding Tosefes Yom ha'Kipurim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MUKTZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Kehana):</span> The instruction in the Mishnah to begin from the straw (being stored for animals) seems to indicate that taking from long-term storage does not engender a problem of Muktzah, and must be the opinion of R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa of the Mishnah prohibits the wood in the Muktzah, implying that the Tana is concerned for Muktzah (and must be R. Yehudah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even R. Shimon would agree that this wood is Muktzah (because of Chisaron Kis since wood suited for construction would not normally be used as firewood).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Alternate rendering of R. Kehana's teaching):</span> The prohibition of taking the wood in the Muktzah which points to the Mishnah being R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Reisha points to R. Shimon?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even R. Yehudah would agree that this straw is not Muktzah (since it is rotten and only usable as firewood).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But rotten straw is usable as mortar!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This straw has thorns.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH: TAKING APART AN OHEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may not undo the roof of an Ohel (such as the Sechach of an old Sukah) for firewood on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We may only take wood which is nearby.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE WOOD WHICH IS NEARBY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The nearby (presumably lying on top of the Sechach) wood should be prohibited just as is the Sechach (Stiras Ohel)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah is speaking of wood that is leaning against (but not attached to) the wall of the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Answer (R. Menashya) The Seifa permits (the still tied up) bundles of wood, which are on the Sukah, but are not Batel to the Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could R. Shimon permit taking Sechach which was placed conditionally on the Sukah, given the prohibition of Stiras Ohel!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman b. Yitzchak):</span> The Beraisa speaks of a Sukah that collapsed on Yom Tov and thus (acc. to R. Shimon) is not Muktzah, like the oil which remains from the Shabbos candles.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But a person anticipates the candle going out, but surely did not anticipate the day when the Sukah will collapse!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman b. Yitzchak):</span> It was threatening to collapse from before Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>THE SUKAH IS PROHIBITED ON SUKOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could a condition help, given that the Sukah is Asur b'Hana'ah all seven days (two sources)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Menashia b. Rava):</span> The reference to Sechach placed with a condition is not speaking on Sukos (when the Sechach would surely be Asur, as taught), but of a condition made before another Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that a condition <i>would</i> work to permit parts of the Sukah even on Sukos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye and Rava):</span> A condition may only be made regarding the decorations of the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should the Sukah be more stringent than an Esrog which <i>is</i> subject to his condition (Rav holds that it may be used on its day and eaten while R. Asi permits it on the next day)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mitzvah of Esrog (unlike the Sukah) is interrupted by nighttime and thus each day is viewed as a separate Mitzvah.</p></div>
