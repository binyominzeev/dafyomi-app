<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WALLED CITIES FROM THE DAYS OF YEHOSHUA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> Lud, Ono, and Gei Hacharashim were surrounded by a wall from the days of Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Two of) these were built later, by Alpa'el!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Alpa'el's sons were Eiver and Mesha'am and Shmar; he built Ono and Lud and its villages."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Another verse says that Asa built them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (R. Elazar):</span> These were built in the days of Yehoshua, destroyed in the war against Binyamin, and rebuilt by Alpa'el. They fell again, and Asa fixed them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> "Let us build <i>these</i> cities" shows that they already were cities.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE OBLIGATION OF <i>KERI'AS HA'MEGILAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> Women must read the Megilah, because they were also in the miracle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> When Purim falls on Shabbos, we publicly expound the Megilah on that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious, the same applies to any Yom Tov!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Moshe enacted that we should expound Hilchos Pesach, Shavu'os and Sukos, each on its day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He needs to teach about Purim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Rabah says that the decree not to <i>read</i> the Megilah on Shabbos was lest one carry a Megilah in a Reshus ha'Rabim.) One might have thought that we should not expound it for the same reason. He teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> One must read the Megilah at night and <i>Lishnosah</i> during the day. We learn this from "I call to you by day ... and night."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> <i>Lishnosah</i> means to learn the Mishnayos of Megilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yirmeyah):</span> No, it means to repeat (the reading).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (R. Chelbo):</span> One must read the Megilah at night and in the day. We learn from "So my soul will sing to you and not be silent."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>VILLAGES READ EARLY ON THE DAY OF GATHERING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Villages read on the day of assembly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Chachamim made a leniency for villagers, in order that they should (be free to) supply food and water to the cities (on Purim).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The enactment was not to help the cities!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When the 14th falls on Monday, villages and cities read on that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the enactment was to help cities, the villages should read the previous Thursday!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim did not institute to read on the 10th.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> When the 14th falls on Thursday, villages read on that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the enactment is to help cities, the villages should read the previous Monday (the 11th)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not push aside a day of assembly to read on a different day of assembly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> The enactment only applies in places where villagers enter on days of assembly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the enactment is to help cities, it should apply everywhere!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> The enactment is <i>because</i> villagers supply food and water to the cities.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE DAYS ON WHICH THE <i>MEGILAH</i> IS READ</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah begin by listing the days of the month in order, and then switch to list the days of the week?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it listed in order how the Megilah may be read on the 11th, 12th, etc. the order would be haphazard, and people would err.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Our Mishnah is like Rebbi or R. Yosi, as we will explain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When the 14th falls on Friday, villages and cities read on Thursday, and walled cities read on Friday;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rebbi says, cities are not uprooted (from their usual day); they and walled cities read on Friday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The first Tana learns from "Every year" that every year, cities read before walled cities.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not say that every year cities read on the 14th?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is impossible (since we are more concerned that they read before walled cities).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rebbi learns that every year, cities are not pushed off from the 14th.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not say that every year cities read before walled cities?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is impossible (since we are more concerned that they read on the 14th).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When the 14th falls on Friday, villages and walled cities read on Thursday; cities read on Friday;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Yosi says, walled cities do not read before cities; rather, both read on Friday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana learns that "Every year" cities read on the 14th, and on a different day than walled cities.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not say that every year walled cities do not read before the open cities?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is not possible (since he is more concerned that they read on different days).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yosi learns that every year, walled cities do not read before the open cities.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not say that every year they read on different days?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is not possible (since he is more concerned that walled cities not read before the open cities).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere, Rebbi taught that cities read early on the day of assembly!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When the 14th falls on Shabbos, villages read on Thursday, cities on Friday, and walled cities on Sunday;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says that since cities are pushed off, they are pushed back to Thursday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, once they are being pushed off, they are pushed back to Thursday. When the 14th falls on Friday, there is no need to push them off.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is the following teaching?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> When the 14th falls on Shabbos, all are pushed off to Thursday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span>  This cannot be. Certainly, walled cities read on Sunday!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> He means, all that are pushed off are pushed off to Thursday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> All agree that the Megilah is not read on Shabbos. What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> All must hear the Megilah, but some are not skilled to read it. Perhaps such a person will carry it four Amos in a Reshus ha'Rabim to learn from one who knows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not blow the Shofar or take the Lulav on Shabbos because of a similar concern.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> The poor look forward to the Megilah reading (Matanos l'Evyonim are given on the day we read; they may not be given on Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Even though villages read early, we collect and give Matanos l'Evyonim on the day they read.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(v)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rather, it should say <i>because</i> they read early, we collect and give on that day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(w)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Because villages read early, we collect and give Matanos l'Evyonim on that day, since the poor look forward to them.</p>
