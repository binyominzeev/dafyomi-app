<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>MITZVOS</i> THAT MAY BE DONE ANY TIME DURING THE NIGHT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The whole night is Kosher for reaping the Omer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>It was taught that reaping the Omer and Sefiras ha'Omer are at night. The Omer is offered during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We learn about Haktarah of Chelev and limbs from "The entire night until the morning."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The rule is, a daytime Mitzvah is Kosher the entire day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This comes to include arranging spoons (of frankincense that accompany Lechem ha'Panim) on the Shulchan and removing them. This is like R. Yosi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Even if the old Lechem ha'Panim was removed in the morning and the new Lechem was not arranged until close to evening, it is not a problem.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We require "V'Nosata Al ha'Shulchan Lechem Panim Lefanai <i>Tamid</i>"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This forbids leaving the Shulchan without bread overnight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Every nighttime Mitzvah is Kosher the entire night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This comes to include eating Korban Pesach. It is unlike R. Elazar ben Azaryah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa -R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> A Gezeirah Shavah "ba'Laylah ha'Zeh-ba'Laylah ha'Zeh" to Makos Bechoros teaches that Pesach may be eaten only until midnight.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'KOREI ES HA'MEGILAH</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MISHNAH: WE STAND FOR KERI'AS HA'TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may stand or sit while reading the Megilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One is Yotzei whether one or two read it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One needs to bless on it only where that is the custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>On Monday, Thursday, and Shabbos afternoon, exactly three read from the Torah. There is no Haftorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>On Rosh Chodesh and Chol ha'Moed exactly four read; there is no Haftorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The ones who read first and last bless before and after reading, respectively.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This is the general rule. Any day with Musaf, and it is not Yom Tov, four read;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>On Yom Tov five read; others may be added. There is a Haftorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>On Yom Kipur at least six read, and a Haftorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>On Shabbos at least seven read, and a Haftorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The ones who read first and last bless before and after reading, respectively.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> (One may read the Megilah standing or sitting -) this does not apply to Torah (we must stand while reading it b'Tzibur)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> We learn from "Stand here with me". Had the Torah not written this, it would be forbidden to say this. It was as if also Hash-m stood!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This also teaches that the Rebbi should not sit on a bed while teaching Talmidim sitting on the ground (rather, they should be equal).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> From the days of Moshe until R. Gamliel, people stood while learning Torah. After R. Gamliel died, people became weak, and people learned while sitting. (Yehoshua used to arrange the benches where Moshe taught (Bamidbar Rabah 21:14). Perhaps we can explain that people sat while reviewing, or when learning harsh matters, like Rav or Rava below);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The honor of Torah ceased when R. Gamliel died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> It says, "Va'Eshev (I sat) on the mountain", and it says, "I stood on the mountain"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (Rav):</span> Moshe learned while standing, and reviewed his learning while sitting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2 (R. Chanina):</span> Moshe neither sat nor stood. Rather, he was bent over.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> "Va'Eshev" does not mean 'I sat', rather, 'I delayed'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #4 (Rava):</span> He learned gentle matters while standing, and harsh matters while sitting.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>READING SIMULTANEOUSLY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One person reads the Torah, and one translates. Two may not (simultaneously) translate (or read, for they will not be heard);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One person reads from the Nevi'im, and two may translate. (We are not so concerned that it be heard, since Nevi'im do not teach Halachos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Ten people may read (or translate - Rashi deletes this from the text) Hallel or the Megilah at the same time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are these different?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since they are dear to people, they concentrate and can hear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Where the custom is to bless, one blesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This refers to the Berachah after reading; before, it is a Mitzvah to bless;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One blesses Over (before) performing any Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that 'Over' means before?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> "Va'Yaratz Achima'atz va'Ya'avor Es ha'Kushi".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> "V'Hu Avar Lifneihem".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "Va'Ya'avor Malkam Lifneihem va'Shem b'Rosham".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Berachos are made?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Sheshes blessed 'Mem-Nun-Ches' (Al Mikra <i>M</i>egilah, she'Asah <i>N</i>isim and Shehe'<i>Ch</i>eyanu) before reading.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>After reading, we bless 'the One who wages our conflict, judges our case, takes our vengeance, .... and repays all our enemies. Baruch Atah Hash-m, who pays up Yisrael from all their enemies.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We end 'ha'Kel ha'Moshi'a.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> We do not favor one opinion over the other; rather, we say both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Monday, Thursday and Shabbos afternoon three people read.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To what do these three correspond?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> They correspond to Kohanim, Leviyim and Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Simi taught that we do not read less than 10 verses. To what do they correspond?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> They correspond to 10 Batlanim (people that do not work and are always in the Beis ha'Keneses).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> They correspond to Aseres ha'Dibros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Levi):</span> They correspond to the 10 Hilulim (praises) in Psalms.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Yochanan):</span> They correspond to the 10 declarations of creation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Va'Yomer Hash-m" only nine times!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Bereishis" is also a declaration.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Whichever of the three people reads four verses is praised (more than the others who read three each).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We find a preference for the first regarding the three boxes of Shekalim of Terumas ha'Lishkah. They are labeled so we will know which is first, for the Mitzvah is to buy Korbanos Tzibur from the first box.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We find a preference for the middle regarding the branches of the Menorah:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "El Mul Penei ha'Menorah Ya'iru Shiv'as ha'Neros" teaches that the six lamps of the branches are tilted towards the Ner Ma'aravi (the middle lamp), and the Ner Ma'aravi is tilted towards the Shechinah (in the west).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This shows that the middle is preferable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>There is a preference for the last because we ascend in Kedushah, and do not descend.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A case occurred in which the first person read four verses, and Rav Papa praised him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not detract nor increase from the number of people that read.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The first person blesses before reading; the last person blesses after reading.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span>Nowadays everyone blesses before and after Keri'as ha'Torah. We are afraid lest a person enter (or leave) in the middle, and he will think that we do not bless before (or after).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE <i>KRI'AH</i> ON ROSH CHODESH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Rosh Chodesh and Chol ha'Moed there are four Olim (people called to read).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ula bar Rav):</span> How do we split the Kri'ah for Rosh Chodesh among the four?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first eight verses are a Parshah (a segment of the Torah delineated by spaces. In printed Chumashim a Samech or Pei denotes the end of a Parshah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The first two Olim cannot read three verses each, for this would leave two verses in the Parshah, and we do not do this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Each will read four.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, how will the last two Olim read the remaining seven verses, which consist of a Parshah of two verses and a Parshah of five?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first (of the last two Olim) cannot read the Parshah of two and one verse from the next Parshah, for we do not begin less than three verses of a Parshah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he will read the Parshah of two and three from the next Parshah, only two will remain for the last person!</p>
