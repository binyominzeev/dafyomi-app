<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ATTRIBUTES OF <i>CHACHAMIM</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Freida attributed his long life to these merits:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>No one ever came to the Beis Medrash before him; he never blessed (at a meal) before a Kohen; he never ate from an animal before the Zero'a, Lechayim v'Kevah were separated (to be given to a Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Eating from an animal before the Matanos are separated is (forbidden) like eating Tevel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Halachah does not follow R. Yitzchak.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it praiseworthy that he never blessed before a Kohen?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a Chacham allows an ignoramus Kohen, even a Kohen Gadol, to bless before him, he is worthy of death.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It says "Kol Mesan'ai Ohavu Maves" - we read this 'Masni'ai' (those who make people hate 'me' (Torah)).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Freida never blessed before a Kohen Chacham (even if he was a greater Chacham than the Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Nechunya ben Hakanah attributed his long life to the following merits:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He refused to get honor from his colleague's disgrace, similar to Rav Huna;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rav Chana bar Chanilai offered to carry Rav Huna's shovel. Rav Huna said 'unless you normally carry your own shovel, I refuse.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He would not sleep before forgiving one who had cursed him. This is like Mar Zutra. Before Mar Zutra went to sleep he would forgive all who pained him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He was easygoing with his money. This is like Iyov, who used to give a Perutah of his money to a grocer. (Bava Basra 15b says that when a regular person owes a worker half a Perutah (the smallest coin is a Perutah), they go to a grocer and share something that costs a Perutah. Iyov would give the full Perutah. Perhaps Iyov did not want his generosity to 'deprive' the grocer, so he would give the grocer a Perutah in such a case.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Akiva asked R. Nechunya ha'Gadol why he lived so long (i.e. in what merits). R. Nechunya's servants thought that R. Akiva was unhappy that he lived so long. They hit him, and he ran up a tree.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Akiva):</span> Why does it say "Es ha'Keves <i>Echad</i>"? "Ha'Keves" (singular) already teaches that there is only one!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Nechunya realized that R. Akiva was a Chacham; he told his servants not to bother him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nechunya):</span> This teaches that it should be the best in the herd.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Nechunya attributed his long life to the following merits:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>I never received gifts; I never repaid the pain someone gave me; I was open with my money.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Not receiving gifts is like R. Elazar, who would not accept gifts or invitations from the Nasi's house, because "Sonei Matanos Yichyeh";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Zeira would not accept gifts, but he accepted invitations from the Nasi's house. He reasoned that his coming honors them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Not returning pain is like Rava taught, that if one overlooks what others do to him, all his transgressions are overlooked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah attributed his long life to the fact that he never looked at an evil person.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One may not look at an evil person.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Looking at a Rasha weakens eyes. Yitzchak became blind because he had looked at Esav.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yitzchak taught that Avimelech's curse was the cause!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both caused it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We learn from "Seis Pnei Rasha Lo Tov".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>When R. Yehoshua ben Korchah was about to die, Rebbi requested a Berachah:</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> You should live to half my age.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Should I not live to your entire age?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Should your sons be shepherds?! (If you live so long, sons will never become Nasi.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Avuha bar Ihi or Minyamin bar Ihi praised himself for never looking at a Kusi. The other praised himself for never becoming a partner with a Kusi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>R. Zeira attributed his long life to the following merits:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He never was demanding in his house; he never walked in front of someone greater than himself; he didn't think in Torah where there was a bad smell; he didn't walk four Amos without Torah and Tefilin; he never slept in a Beis Medrash, not fixed nor haphazardly; he didn't rejoice at the stumbling of a colleague; he never called someone by his nickname or family nickname.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PROPER CONDUCT IN A BEIS HA'KENESES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> In a destroyed Beis ha'Keneses we may not eulogize, twine ropes, set traps, spread fruit on the roof to dry, or make it a shortcut.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"I will make desolate your holy places" - even when they are desolate, they are Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If weeds grow in it, we do not cut them, to cause grief (that it is desolate).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> We do not conduct ourselves frivolously in Batei Kenesiyos. We do not eat, drink, adorn ourselves, or stroll in them;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>We do not enter a Beis ha'Keneses to avoid heat or rain; we do not eulogize an individual in a Beis ha'Keneses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>We may learn in a Beis ha'Keneses, and give mass eulogies (e.g. of a Chacham);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, this applies when they are settled. When they are desolate we abandon them, and let weeds grow to cause grief.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The Beraisa connotes that R. Yehudah argues, but) the first Tana didn't mention weeds!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated, it means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We sweep and wash the floor, so weeds will not grow;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, this applies when they are settled. When they are desolate we let weeds grow and do not cut them, to cause grief.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Batei Kenesiyos in Bavel are made on condition (that we may use them when they will be desolate). Nevertheless, we do not act in them frivolously, i.e. to make calculations;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We leave a corpse overnight in a Beis ha'Keneses in which calculations are made.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely there is no obligation to do so!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Clarification:</span> It means that (Hash-m will punish for this, and) a Mes Mitzvah will be left there overnight.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not adorn ourselves (in a Beis ha'Keneses)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Chachamim are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> It (a Beis Medrash) is called 'the house of Rabanan'. This shows that they may use it like their home (in all ways).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Rava was teaching Ravina and Rav Acha bar Masnah. A torrential rain came; they entered a Beis ha'Keneses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They did not enter to avoid the rain, rather, for the sake of learning, which requires clarity.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha Brei d'Rava):</span> If one must enter a Beis ha'Keneses to call someone:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he is a Chacham, he should say a Halachah. If he just knows Mishnah, he should say a Mishnah; if he knows just Tanach, he should say a verse; if not, he should ask a child to read the verse he is learning, or delay for a short time.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>EULOGIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may give mass eulogies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is an example of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is a eulogy that would be given for someone from the house of Rav Sheshes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> It is a eulogy that would be given for someone from the house of Rav Chisda.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rafram eulogized his daughter-in-law in a Beis ha'Keneses. He reasoned that everyone will come for his honor or hers. R. Zeira eulogized a Chacham in a Beis ha'Keneses for the same reason.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Reish Lakish eulogized a man who sat in the 24th row of Talmidim and learned Halachos. He said 'Eretz Yisrael has lost a great man.' (This is like the Maharsha. Rashba - he learned Halachos, and Reish Lakish gave a great eulogy to 24 rows of people. Rashi says that he <i>taught</i> Mishnayos to 24 rows of Talmidim. According to this, perhaps he was greater than the man Rav Nachman refused to eulogize; if so, the Gemara's conclusion (See the difference... ) is not so clear.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Rav Nachman refused to eulogize a man who learned (Rashi - taught) Mishnah, Medrash and Tosefta, because 'He is empty' (he never learned how to resolve difficulties in the Mishnah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>See the difference between the mighty ones of Eretz Yisrael and the Chasidim of Bavel (Reish Lakish gave a lavish praise for a Talmid, whereas Rav Nachman refused to eulogize someone who was more learned)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who uses the crown (of Torah) will perish.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> This is one who is served by one who learns Halachos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> One may use someone who learns four (Sedorim of the Mishnah which apply in Bavel), but not someone who teaches them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>A man was carrying Reish Lakish through water. When Reish Lakish heard that the man learned the four Sedorim, he refused to be carried.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">The man:</span> I want to serve you!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> If so, I will teach you something. R. Zeira taught that Benos Yisrael are stringent on themselves to wait seven clean days (before Tevilah) after seeing even a drop of blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei Eliyahu):</span> One who learns Halachos every day has a share in the world to come;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "Halichos Olam Lo" - we read this Halachos.</p></div>
