<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HOW MANY PEOPLE MUST ATTEND A FUNERAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We stop learning Torah to accompany a Mes or a bride. R. Yehudah bar Ilai would do so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This does not apply if enough people already accompany him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the proper amount?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Shmuel bar Inya):</span> We need 12,000 men and 6,000 Shofar blowers. Some say that the 6,000 are included in the 12,000.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> We need enough to make a wall from the city to the cemetery.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Sheshes):</span> The taking of Torah should be like Matan Torah, in front of 600,000.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This applies to one who learned. There is no limit to the proper amount for one who taught.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BATEI KENESIYOS IN BAVEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Yisrael is so dear to Hash-m that wherever we are exiled, the Shechinah accompanies us:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In Mitzrayim - "I was revealed to your father's house in Mitzrayim";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In Bavel - "For your sake I was sent to Bavel."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Hash-m will return with us in the future redemption. It says "Hash-m <i>Yashuv</i> (will return with) your captivity", not 'Heshiv (He will return us)'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where in Bavel is the Shechinah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It alternates between the Batei Kenesiyos of Hutzal and Shaf v'Yatziv.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> When I am within a Parsah (a 72 minute walk), I go to pray there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Shmuel's father and Levi were in the Beis ha'Keneses of Shaf v'Yatziv in Nehardai. The Shechinah came. They heard a noise and left.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>A similar episode occurred to Rav Sheshes (who was blind); he did not leave. Angels came and frightened him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes (to Hash-m):</span> Who should be pushed aside, one who is shamed (me), or one who is not shamed?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Hash-m told the angels to leave him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "I will be to them a small Mikdash" refers to Batei Kenesiyos and Batei Medrashos in Bavel;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> It refers to Rav's house in Bavel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Hash-m, You were a dwelling place for us" refers to Batei Kenesiyos and Batei Medrashos in Bavel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> I used to learn at home and pray in a Beis ha'Keneses. After I was struck by David's words, "Hash-m, I love Your dwelling" I also learn in a Beis ha'Keneses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ha'Kapar):</span> In the future, Batei Kenesiyos and Batei Medrashos of Bavel will be fixed in Eretz Yisrael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn from "Like Tavor among the mountains and Karmel on the sea will come". These mountains came once to learn (at the time of Matan) Torah, and they were fixed in Eretz Yisrael. People learn and spread Torah in Batei Kenesiyos and Batei Medrashos of Bavel, all the more so they will be fixed in Eretz Yisrael!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Bar Kapara):</span> "Lamah Teratzdun Harim Gavnunim" - a Bas Kol told the other mountains 'why Tirtzu Din (do you want a judgment) with Har Sinai' (to see on which Torah should be given)? You are blemished compared to Sinai (which is the lowest)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Gavnunim" is like "Giben" (a Mum),</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> This shows that haughtiness is a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not use a Beis ha'Keneses for a shortcut.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> If there used to be a path there, it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> If one entered for a different reason, he may make it a shortcut.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> If one entered to pray, he may make it a shortcut;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn from "One who enters (the Mikdash) in the north to bow will leave in the south."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If weeds grow we do not cut them, to cause grief.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> We may not cut them and feed them (to animals), but we may cut them and leave them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also the Mishnah forbids only cutting them to feed them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not act frivolously in a cemetery:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We do not graze animals there, or route an irrigation ditch through it. We do not gather weeds in it; if one gathered, they are burned there, for the honor of the deceased.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is 'for the honor of the deceased'?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot be burning the weeds, for this does not honor them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to the Reisha, we do not act frivolously there.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN WE READ PARSHAS SHEKALIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When Rosh Chodesh Adar falls on Shabbos, we read Parshas Shekalim. If it falls during the week, we read it the previous Shabbos, and the next Shabbos has no special Parshah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The second, third and fourth Shabbosos we read Parshiyos Zachor, Parah Adumah and ha'Chodesh. The fifth Shabbos we resume the normal order.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We interrupt (the normal order) for all of the following - Rosh Chodesh, Chanukah, Purim, Ta'aneisim, Ma'amados, and Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> We announce about Shekalim and Kil'ayim on Rosh Chodesh Adar.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand regarding Kil'ayim, for this is when it sprouts;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Why is this the time to announce about Shekalim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Tavi):</span> "Zos Olas Chodesh b'Chodsho" - bring Korbanos from new money. (A Gezeirah Shavah teaches that this refers to Nisan.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since new money is needed for Nisan, we read the Parshah on the first of Adar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> These Mishnayos are unlike R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We begin learning Hilchos Pesach 30 days before Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, we begin two weeks before.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They can even be like R. Shimon ben Gamliel. (Moneychangers') tables are set up on the 15th outside the Mikdash, and on the 25th in the Mikdash (to enable people to give half-Shekalim). We read two weeks before the tables are set up.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHAT IS PARSHAS SHEKALIM?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Parshas Shekalim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It is "Tzav... (the Tamid offering)";</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> It is "Ki Sisa (the Mitzvah to give half-Shekelim)."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav, why is it called Parshas Shekalim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like R. Tavi taught ("Zos Olas Chodesh b'Chodsho" is in Parshas "Tzav... ").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav, we understand why we read "Tzav", for it alludes to (bringing Shekalim for) Korbanos; like R. Tavi taught.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to Shmuel, how does Parshas Shekalim relate to (Shekalim for) Korbanos? "Ki Sisa" discusses Shekalim given for the Adanim (sockets of the Mishkan) not for the Korbanos themselves)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like a Beraisa that Rav Yosef taught. Three collections were made. One was for Korbanos, one for the Adanim, and one for Bedek ha'Bayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>According to Rav, why does the Mishnah mention Rosh Chodesh Adar on Shabbos? Whenever Rosh Chodesh falls on Shabbos, we read Tzav!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> On another Shabbos Rosh Chodesh, six read from the weekly Parshah and one in Tzav. On Rosh Chodesh Adar, all read in Tzav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that we interrupt from reading the usual weekly Parshah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>How can we answer for the opinion that we read the weekly Parshah and a special Haftorah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This Rosh Chodesh, three read from the weekly Parshah and four read from Tzav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> When Rosh Chodesh Adar is on Shabbos, we read Parshas Shekalim, and Yehoyada ha'Kohen for the Haftorah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Haftorah discusses "Kesef Nafshos Erko" - this is like Ki Sisa (which discusses "Kofer Nafsho");</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, if Parshas Shekalim is Tzav, how does the Haftorah relate to it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like R. Tavi (Tzav alludes to bringing Shekalim for Korbanos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Rosh Chodesh Adar is in the week before or after (we normally read) Parshas Shekalim, we read it and repeat it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We read Ki Sisa about this time, but Tzav is read much later!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses Eretz Yisrael, where they read the Torah over the course of three years (they reach Tzav in Adar of the third year).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> When Rosh Chodesh Adar falls on Shabbos, we read Ki Sisa. The Haftorah is Yehoyada ha'Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE KRI'AH FOR ROSH CHODESH TEVES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> When Rosh Chodesh Adar falls on Shabbos, we take out three Sefrei Torah, in which we read the weekly Parshah, Musaf of Rosh Chodesh, and Parshas Shekalim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>When Rosh Chodesh Teves falls on Shabbos, we take out three Sefrei Torah, in which we read the weekly Parshah, Musaf Rosh Chodesh; and Chanukas ha'Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>He needed to say both teachings:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had he only taught the latter, one might have thought that the Halachah follows Rav, and only two Sefrei Torah are needed when Rosh Chodesh Adar is on Shabbos since the reading for Rosh Chodesh is in Tzav).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he need to teach the second? The first would have sufficed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Admission:</span> Indeed, he did not teach the second. It was deduced from the first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> When Rosh Chodesh Teves falls on a weekday, three read the Parshah of Rosh Chodesh, and one reads Chanukas ha'Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi of Chaifa):</span> Three read from Chanukas ha'Mizbe'ach, and one reads Rosh Chodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Mani):</span> Presumably, R. Yitzchak Nafcha is correct. Rosh Chodesh is preferred,since it comes more frequently.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> Presumably, Rav Dimi is correct. There is a fourth Aliyah because it is Rosh Chodesh, therefore, he should read about Rosh Chodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> Rosh Chodesh is not primary.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> Chanukah is not primary.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>The Halachah follows Rabah.</p></div>
