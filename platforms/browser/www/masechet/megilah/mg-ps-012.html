<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISCALCULATIONS OF THE SEVENTY YEARS OF EXILE (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Also Daniel miscalculated! "Ani Daniel <i>Binosi</i> bi'Sforim" connotes that he had erred.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> The 70 years are "Melos l'Bavel"; it also says "l'Charvos Yerushalayim Shiv'im"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The first verse (counts from the conquest of Yehoyakim and) alludes to a sanction to begin rebuilding the Mikdash (from Koresh; he later retracted. They started again 70 years from the Churban, and this was completed);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn (the former) from "Koresh, king of Persia, said '... Hash-m appointed me to build for Him a house in Yerushalayim.'"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> "So said Hash-m to his Mashi'ach, to Koresh" -   Koresh was not Mashi'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Hash-m was complaining about Koresh to Mashi'ach. I said that <i>he</i> should build My house and gather My exiles, but he said 'who will go up among you, will go' (he did not go himself).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ACHASHVEROSH'S PARTY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Cheil Paras u'Madai", but another verse puts Madai first, "L'Malchei Madai u'Faras"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They agreed that if the kings will be from Paras, the officers will be from Madai, and vice versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> "In showing the wealth, the honor of his kingdom" teaches that he wore Bigdei Kehunah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says here "Tif'eres", like it says regarding Bigdei Kehunah, for honor and glory.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rav and Shmuel argue about "When these days finished":</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One says that he was a clever king. First he endeared subjects from far away, for he can always appease those close by;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The other says that he was foolish. First he should have endeared subjects of his region, so they would support him if the others rebel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Talmidei R. Shimon):</span> Why were <i>the haters of</i> (this is a euphemism) Yisrael of that generation worthy to be destroyed?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon bar Yochai:</span> Answer yourselves!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Talmidim):</span> It was because they benefited from the Rasha's (Achashverosh's) meal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Shimon):</span> If so, the decree should have been against only the Yisraelim in Shushan, not in the whole world!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Talmidim:</span> How do you answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Shimon bar Yochai):</span> It was because they bowed to Nevuchadnetzar's image. (Tosfos (Avodah Zarah 3a DH she'Lo) says that it was not Avodah Zarah. Nevertheless, they should not have bowed.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Talmidim):</span> (If so, how did they merit to be saved miraculously?) Did Hash-m show partiality?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon):</span> They did not really serve it, they just appeared to do so. Similarly, Hash-m only appeared to decree their destruction - "Ki Lo Anah mi'Libi."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Rav and Shmuel argue about "In the courtyard, the garden, the orchard of the king":</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One says that everyone was placed in one of these places, according to his prestige;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The other says that Achashverosh put everyone in the courtyard, but they did not fit. He put them all in the garden, but they did not fit. Finally, he put them in the orchard, and they fit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He put them in the courtyard and made two openings; one was to the garden, and one was to the orchard.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "<i>Chur</i>, Karpas u'Techeiles" - it was Chari Chari (needlepoint, full of holes).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He spread white (Chiver) silk for them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> Karpas is Karim of Pasim (striped pillows).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Beds of gold and silver" - everyone was seated on a bed of gold or silver, according to his prestige.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Nechemyah):</span> That would cause jealousy! Rather, the beds were of silver and the legs were of gold.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ACHASHVEROSH'S PARTY (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> "Bahat" are stones for which people MisCHoTet (obtain after great exertion and expense);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like "Avnei MisNoSesos", which come through great Nisyonos (difficulties).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Dar v'Sochares" - Dari Dari (there were rows and rows of the stones Sechor (around)).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> There is a precious stone in the port cities, called Darah; he set it in the middle of the meal, and it illuminated for them like noon (Sihara).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> He proclaimed Deror (freedom from taxes) for all Sochrim (merchants).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "Mi'Kelim <i>Shonim</i>"? It should say 'Meshunim'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A voice from Heaven said 'the Rishonim (Belshatzar and his company) were destroyed because of Kelim, and you are Shonim (repeating their mistake)!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "V'Yein Malchus <i>Rav</i>" - each person was given wine Rav (older) than himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "The drinking was <i>k'Das</i>"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chanan):</span> It was like the Torah says, i.e. the eating exceeded the drinking (just like an animal and the flour offered with it exceed the wine offered with it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Without compulsion" - everyone was given wine of his country (he is used to it, he can control how drunk he gets).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Ki'Rtzon Ish va'Ish " - the desire of Mordechai and Haman (they served the wine).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mordechai is called "Ish Yehudi"; Haman is called "Ish Tzar v'Oyev".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Also Vashti made a party for the women in the palace" - it should have been in the women's house!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Both of them (she and Achashverosh) intended for sin (that people should see her beauty).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like people say, he is in big gourds, and his wife in small gourds.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE KILLING OF VASHTI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "On the seventh day, when the king's heart was merry with wine" - was it not merry with wine until now?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The seventh day was Shabbos, when Yisrael eat and drink and begin with Divrei Torah and praises, whereas idolaters eat and drink and begin with obscenities.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Likewise, at the Rasha's party some said that Persian women are beautiful, and others said that Median women are beautiful.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Achashverosh:</span> My Keli (wife) is neither, rather, Babylonian. Would you like to see her?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">The others:</span> Yes, but she must be naked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Hash-m treats people Midah k'Neged Midah. We learn from here that Vashti the Resha'ah used to strip Jewish women of their clothing and make them work on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"... Achashverosh remembered what she did and what was decreed upon her" - just like she did was decreed upon her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned that Vashti intended for sin; why didn't she come?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> This teaches that she became leprous.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> Gavri'el came and made a tail on her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "The king was very angry" - why was he so angry?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> She sent to him 'Stable boy of my father! My father would drink as much as [the bigger drinker among] 1000 people and not get drunk, but wine gets you drunk!' (Chasam Sofer - she said this in Babylonian, the servants who relayed the message did not understand it. This was why Achashverosh decreed that a woman must speak the language of her husband.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>"The king said to the Chachamim" refers to Rabanan; "who know the times" - they know how to make leap years and to fix Rosh Chodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Achashverosh asked Rabanan to judge her. They reasoned:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we tell him to kill her, tomorrow he will sober up and blame us for convicting her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We cannot tell him to pardon her, for she disgraced the king!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> After the Churban we were exiled from our land, and we lost the counsel needed for capital cases. Go ask (Amon and - Tosfos deletes this from the text) Mo'av, who sit on their land like wine sitting on its dregs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Mo'av has been tranquil from his youth... he did not go into exile, therefore he still has his reason... "</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>EXPOUNDING NAMES IN THE MEGILAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> "Veha'<i>Karov</i> Elav Karshena Shesar..." - this entire verse alludes to Korbanos (the angels mentioned Yisrael's merits so that Hash-m would avenge Vashti and make Esther queen):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Karshena" - did they (Nochrim) offer in front of you KaRim Benei SHaNah (yearling lambs), like Yisrael?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Shesar" - did they offer to You "SHtei ToRim (two birds)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Admasa" - did they build for You an altar of Adamah (earth)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"Tarshish" - did they serve in front of You with Bigdei Kehunah, which contain "Tarshish v'Shoham v'Yashfe (gems on the Choshen)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>"Meres" - did they Memares (mix) blood (to prevent it from hardening) in front of You?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>"Marsena" - did they Memares (knead) Menachos in front of You?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>"Memuchan" - did they Mechin (prepare) a Shulchan in front of You?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Memuchan" is Haman. He is called Memuchan because he was Muchan (prepared) for punishment.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> (Memuchan was the last and lowest of the advisors, yet he spoke first;) this shows that the commoner jumps to the top.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "That each man should rule in his house" - if not for the first letters (which established the king to be a fool), there would not have remained any remnant of (the haters of) Yisrael (people would have rushed to carry out Haman's letters immediately, before the designated day).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>People said that the first letters are unnecessary, for even a bald man is the officer in his house! (Maharsha - Rashi merely says that also a weaver (a lowly profession) rules in his house. Rashi agree that 'Karachah' is a bald man.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Every sharp one acts wisely" refers to David. He sought "<i>a</i> virgin" (only one; therefore everyone eagerly brought his daughter, hoping that she will be picked);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"A fool spreads folly" refers to Achashverosh. "The king appointed overseers" (he will gather many girls and have relations with all of them, but only one will become queen), so people hid their daughters.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Ish Yehudi Hayah ... Ish Yemini" - if the verse comes to give his lineage, it should trace the entire lineage until Binyamin! Why does it only list three?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> It lists only ancestors whose names apply to Mordechai:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Ben Ya'ir" - he (Mordechai) was Me'ir (illuminated) the eyes of Yisrael with his prayer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Ben Shim'i" - Hash-m Shama (heard) his prayer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Ben Kish" - he was Mekish (knocked) on the gates of mercy, and they opened for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> He is called "Yehudi", i.e. from Yehudah; he is also called Yemini, i.e. from Binyamin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Mordechai was crowned with impeccable Torah conduct (Aruch. Maharsha - the verse gives the lineage of both of his parents, like Rabah bar Rav Huna explains immediately. According to this, Rabah bar Rav Huna is not a separate answer).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> His father was from Binyamin and his mother was from Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rabanan):</span> The Shevatim competed over taking credit for his birth:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Yehudah took credit, for David (from Yehudah) did not kill Shim'i ben Gera (even though Shim'i was Chayav Misah for cursing David; this enabled Mordechai to descend from Shim'i;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Binyamin took credit, since Mordechai descends from Binyamin.</p></div>
   </div>
