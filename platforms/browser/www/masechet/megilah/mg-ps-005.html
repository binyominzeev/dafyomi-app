<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>HALACHOS</i> OF READING EARLY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even when villages read early, the festive meal is on the 14th.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> When the Megilah is read in the proper time, an individual may read it. It may be read early only in a Minyan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> A Minyan is always required l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A case occurred and Rav was stringent like Rav Asi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> When Purim falls on Shabbos, Friday is the time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If it falls on Shabbos, Shabbos is the time!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He must mean that Keri'as ha'Megilah not in its time is like reading it in its time, i.e. an individual may read! (Above he required a Minyan when reading early.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No; rather, Rav teaches that we read on Friday, unlike Rebbi who says that we read on Thursday.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH <i>MITZVOS</i> MAY BE DONE EARLY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there are less than 10 Batlanim in a city, it is considered a village.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Megilah may be read early, but not later.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The following may be delayed but not advanced:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><i>Eitzei Kohanim</i> (when certain families would donate wood for the Mizbe'ach);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(The fast of) Tish'ah b'Av;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><i>Chagigah</i> (the Shelamim that one must offer on each festival);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><i>Hakhel</i> (reading the Torah in the presence of all of Israel on the second day of Sukos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Even though the Megilah may be read on an earlier day, eulogies and fasting are permitted on that day. One may fulfill Matanos l'Evyonim on that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> In a place where villagers do not enter on Mondays and Thursdays, the Megilah is read only on the proper day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> The 10 Batlanim are people that are always in the Beis ha'Keneses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Megilah may be read early but not later.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why may we not read later?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> "One will not pass over."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> "The months of the year" teaches that a year is always composed of full months, without extra days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> "A month of days" teaches that a month is always composed of full days, without extra hours.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>The following may be delayed but not advanced - Eitzei Kohanim<i>...</i></p><i>
</i><p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>We do not advance Tish'ah b'Av because we do not advance punishments;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Chagigah and Hakhel (and Eitzei Kohanim) are not advanced because we cannot fulfill a Mitzvah before its time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chagigah and the entire time of Chagigah are delayed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand when Chagigah is delayed, i.e. when it (Yom Tov) falls on Shabbos, we bring Chagigah the next day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, what is 'the time of Chagigah'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Oshaya):</span> The Beraisa means, we delay Chagigah when it is on Shabbos; we delay Olas Re'iyah even on Yom Tov which is the time of Chagigah (i.e. it is not Shabbos). The Beraisa is like Beis Shamai:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> We may bring Shelamim on Yom Tov, but we may not do Semichah; we may not bring Olos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel permit Shelamim and Olos and to do Semichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Beraisa teaches that we may delay the Chagigah the entire time of Chagigah, but no longer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one did not bring the Chagigah on the first day he may bring it any time during the festival, even the last day of Yom Tov. After this, he has no obligation to bring it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> Chagigah may be delayed its entire time, even on Shavu'os, which is only one day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Hillel agree to Beis Shamai that when Shavu'os falls on Shabbos, the next day is (l'Chatchilah) the day of Shechitah (for Chagigah and Olas Re'iyah. They may be brought until six days after Shavu'os.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS <i>MELACHAH</i> PERMITTED ON PURIM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> Rebbi planted a tree on Purim and openly bathed on the 17th of Tamuz. He tried to uproot Tish'ah b'Av, but the other Chachamim disagreed.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> He tried to uproot Tish'ah b'Av only in a year when it fell on Shabbos and it was already pushed off to the next day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> "Two are better than one" (you saved me from a mistake)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could Rebbi plant on Purim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> "(The days of Purim are for) Simchah" forbids eulogies; "Mishteh" forbids fasting; "Yom Tov" forbids Melachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rebbi celebrated Purim on the 14th; he planted on the 15th.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rebbi lived in Teverya, which was surrounded by a wall from the time of Yehoshua!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rebbi planted on the 14th; he celebrated Purim on the 15th.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was Rebbi really sure that Teverya was surrounded by a wall from the time of Yehoshua (and therefore he planted on the 14th)? Chizkiyah read the Megilah in Teverya on both days, because he was unsure if it had a wall from the days of Yehoshua!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chizkiyah was unsure, but Rebbi was sure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if he was sure, work is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Megilas Ta'anis (a Beraisa which lists days of celebration)):</span> The 14th and 15th are days of Purim on which we may not eulogize.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> (Since we already know this from Megilas Esther, surely) this teaches that the Isurim apply on both days, regardless of which day one celebrates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava teaches about eulogies and fasting, but not Melachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav cursed a man for planting flax on Purim, and the flax didn't grow!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case was, he planted on the day he celebrates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rabah brei d'Rava):</span> We can even say that Rebbi planted on the day he celebrates. Yisrael never accepted to refrain from work on Purim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">.	Support:</span> The Megilah records that Mordecai wanted to enact Yom Tov, but when it records Yisrael's acceptance of Purim, it omits this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did Rav curse the man?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In Rav's area, people had a custom not to work (one may not act leniently in front of them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> There was no such custom in Rebbi's area.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> There was such a custom in Rebbi's area; Rebbi planted a tree of Simchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the (four series of) Ta'aneisim (due to lack of rain) finished and rain did not come, we decrease business, building, planting, engagements and weddings.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Only building and planting of Simchah is prohibited, such as a house in which to marry off one's son or a king's orchard. (These are permitted on Purim.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CRITERIA FOR BEING CONSIDERED A WALLED CITY.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Chizkiyah was unsure whether or not Teverya had a wall from the time of Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A verse says that Chamas, Rekes and Kineres were walled cities at that time; we hold that Rekes is Teverya!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One 'wall' of Teverya is the sea; Chizkiyah was unsure if this suffices.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Certainly this is not considered a wall!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "That has a wall" excludes a row of houses which serves as a wall; "around" excludes Teverya, whose wall is the sea.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses redeeming a house sold in a walled city. Chizkiyah was unsure regarding the Megilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps the distinction between open and walled cities is whether or not they are exposed (Teverya is exposed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps the distinction is whether or not the city is protected (Teverya is protected).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rav Asi read the Megilah on both days in Hutzal. He did not know if it was walled from the days of Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Asi):</span> Hutzal had a wall from the days of Yehoshua.</p>
