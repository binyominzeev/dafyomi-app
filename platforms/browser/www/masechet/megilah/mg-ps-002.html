<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: DAYS FOR KERI'AS HA'MEGILAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Megilah is never read before the 11th or after the 15th of Adar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>(People in) villages read on the day of assembly (the last Monday or Thursday before or on the 14th).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>(Open) cities read on the 14th, unless the 14th falls on Shabbos, in which case they read on Thursday.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Walled cities read on the 15th, except when the 15th falls on Shabbos, in which case they read on Friday.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR THESE DAYS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that villages (must) read early?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> They need not read early - we shall learn that Chachamim were lenient to <i>allow</i> villages to read early, so they will be free to supply food and water to the cities on Purim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Clarification of Question:</span> If Anshei Keneses ha'Gedolah decreed that all must read on the 14th or 15th, how could later Chachamim uproot this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Beis Din can overturn the decree of a previous Beis Din only if it is greater in Chachmah and number (of Talmidim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Anshei Keneses ha'Gedolah themselves enacted all these days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this? (The Megilah mentions only the 14th and 15th.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Shemen bar Aba):</span> We learn from "Lekayem Es Yemei ha'Purim ha'Eleh <i>bi'Zmaneihem</i>" - many times were enacted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is needed to teach about the 14th and 15th!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said Zeman - rather, it says Zemaneihem to teach that there are additional times.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need this to learn than one who should read on the 14th may not read on the 15th, or vice-versa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said Zemanam, we would have learned only one extra law; "bi'Zmaneihem" teaches two additional laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that even more days are allowed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The extra days are like the primary days, i.e. there are two.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that 12 and 13 are the extra days!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak):</span> Surely we do not need a source to allow the 13th, it this was the day of assembly! (Rashi - Yisrael took vengeance from their enemies; R. Tam - they gathered to fast and pray.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we include the 16th and 17th!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Lo Ya'avor" (do not pass over the times for reading).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "Ka'Yomim Asher Nachu Vahem" teaches about the 11th and 12th.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>Questions and Answers (m) through (p) are repeated verbatim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Shmuel learn from "bi'Zmaneihem"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shemen holds that since it says "bi'Zmaneihem", as opposed to Zemanam or Zeman, this warrants learning two extra laws - R. Shmuel disagrees.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Shemen learn from "Ka'Yomim..."?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He says that those words teach that the Mitzvah applies on these days  in all generations.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AUTHORSHIP OF THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Our Stam Mishnah is like R. Akiva, but Chachamim say that we may read only on the 14th and 15th.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1- R. Yehudah):</span> The extra days are allowed only when the years and months are decided properly (by the Sanhedrin, and messengers inform people which day was made Rosh Chodesh) and Benei Yisrael are in Eretz Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva does not qualify when the extra days are allowed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If so, R. Yehudah must hold like Chachamim - and he permits extra days! (We may not say that he is a third opinion, for we cannot posit a three-way argument among Tana'im unless this is inescapable.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Akiva, but Chachamim say that nowadays, when people look to the day of the reading (to know when Pesach will be), we only read in the primary time. (Pesach is 29 or 30 days after Purim in walled and open cities, respectively.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa #1 - R. Yehudah):</span> The extra days are allowed only when the years are proper and Benei Yisrael are in Eretz Yisrael, not nowadays when people look to the day of the reading. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rav Ashi established Beraisa #1 to be like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah to avoid a contradiction:</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Ashi):</span> Elsewhere, R. Yehudah allows villages to read early even nowadays!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Yehudah):</span> Villagers may read early only in places where they enter the cities on Mondays and Thursdays.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This applies even nowadays!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution (Rav Ashi):</span> The Tana of Beraisa #1 is R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A difficulty does not justify saying that a different Tana taught the Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Ashi had heard that some attribute Beraisa #1 to R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WALLED-CITIES READ ON THE 15TH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The verse says that open cities celebrate the 14th; we infer that walled cities celebrate the 15th.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps walled cities do not celebrate at all!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Surely, all Yisraelim should celebrate!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Achashverosh's kingdom was from Hodu until Kush (i.e. the entire world, and all the Yisraelim in it accepted the enactment of Purim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps walled cities must celebrate both - it says "to make the day of the 14th... v'Es (and) the day of the 15th... "!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Es" separates them; these (open cities) celebrate the 14th, and these (walled cities) celebrate the 15th.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps walled cities may celebrate either day!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Bi'Zmaneihem" - each has its own separate time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps walled cities celebrate the 13th!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Shushan (they made the 15th a Yom Tov - Esther 9:20).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verses teach on which day to make a Mishteh and Yom Tov - what is the source that this is the proper day to read the Megilah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "The days are remembered and made" - we equate remembering (reading) with making a festive meal and Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>AUTHORSHIP OF THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Our Mishnah is unlike the following Tana:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> Cities surrounded by a wall from the time of Achashverosh read on the 15th.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Shushan, which was surrounded by a wall from the time of Achashverosh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason of the Tana of our Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from a Gezeirah Shavah "Prazi-Prazi" from the cities of Sichon and Og, which were surrounded from the time of Yehoshua.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah did not learn like our Tana because he had no tradition for the Gezeirah Shavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't our Tana learn like R. Yehoshua ben Korchah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We said that he learns from a Gezeirah Shavah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Clarification of question:</span> According to our Tana, Shushan should celebrate the 14th (we have no source that it was surrounded from the time of Yehoshua)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shushan is special, since the miracle was there. (They were give another day to kill their enemies, and rested on the 15th.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to our Tana, we understand "Medinah u'Mdinah" - this distinguishes    between walled cities from the time of Yehoshua bin Nun and those surrounded by a wall afterwards; "v'Ir va'Ir" distinguishes between Shushan and all other cities not surrounded by a wall from that time;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah can similarly use "Medinah u'Mdinah" to distinguish between cities surrounded from the time of Achashverosh and  those surrounded afterwards;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But what can he learn from "v'Ir va'Ir"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Likewise, our Tana should not need to learn from "Medinah u'Mdinah", since he has a Gezeirah Shavah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> Both Tana'im must expound the extra words to teach the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Any place close to a walled city or that can see a walled city has the law of a walled city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered close?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> It is as far as from Chamsan to Teverya, one Mil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he simply say one Mil?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span>  He wanted to teach the size of a Mil.</p></div>
