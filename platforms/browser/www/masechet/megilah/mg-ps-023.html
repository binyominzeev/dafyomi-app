<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>YOM KIPUR AND SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Five read on Yom Tov, and six on Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike both of the coming Tana'im!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> Five read on Yom Tov, six on Yom Kipur, and seven on Shabbos. We may not detract nor add to these.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Akiva says, seven read on Yom Kipur and six on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Our Mishnah allows adding readers, unlike R. Yishmael. The number of readers is unlike R. Akiva!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The following Tana taught our Mishnah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Five read on Yom Tov, six on Yom Kipur, and seven on Shabbos. We may add to these, but we may not detract.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is unlike R. Yishmael's opinion in our Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about the opinion of R. Yishmael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> On Yom Tov we come late to the Beis ha'Keneses and leave early. On Yom Kipur we come early and leave late. On Shabbos, we come early and leave early.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like R. Akiva, who says that more read on Yom Kipur than on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It can be like R. Yishmael. The prayers of Yom Kipur are longer. <span class="note">(<span>Note:</span> nowadays Tefilas Yom Kipur is much longer due to the many Piyutim we say. In the days of the Tana'im, it was only slightly longer due to Viduy and Avodah.)</span></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do the three, five and seven Olim (on Monday, Thursday and Shabbos afternoon, Yom Tov, and Shabbos, respectively) correspond to?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak bar Nachmani or R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> They correspond to the numbers of words in the three verses of Birkas Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of R. Yitzchak and R. Shimon):</span> They correspond to the three who guard the gates (or Kelim) of the Mikdash, the five who (regularly) see the king, and the seven who see him (i.e. including the two scribes - Tosfos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Rav Yosef taught like Answer #1. Abaye asked why he didn't teach this earlier.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> I didn't realize that you needed to know. Did you ever ask me anything that I didn't answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Yakov Minah):</span> What do the six of Yom Kipur correspond to?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They correspond to the six who stood to the right of Ezra and to his left.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse lists seven to his left!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Zecharyah is Meshulam. He is called Meshulam because he was Mishlam (complete) in his deeds.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHOM MAY BE COUNTED AMONG THE SEVEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All count towards the seven, even a child or woman, but Chachamim said that a woman should not read for it is dishonorable to the Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Maftir count towards the seven?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rav Huna and Rav Yirmeyah bar Aba argued about this. One said yes, and one said no.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One opinion says yes, for he reads;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The other opinion says no, like Ula taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> The Maftir first reads in the Torah only to show honor to the Torah (above the Nevi'im). Therefore, he does not count towards the seven.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The Maftir must read at least 21 verses in the Navi, corresponding to the seven who read in the Torah. If the Maftir is not among the seven, a total of eight read, and 24 verses should be required!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Maftir reads the Torah only to honor the Torah, he need not read corresponding to himself.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> We read a Haftorah "Oloseichem Safu" (for Parshas Tzav) with less than 21 verses!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is permitted because the subject is completed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even when the subject is not completed, we do not require 21!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Many times, Rav Shmuel bar Aba read in front of R. Yochanan, and was told to stop after 10 verses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Halachah is different where there is a translator;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Tachlifa bar Shmuel):</span> We read 21 only where there is no translator. Where there is a translator, we read less.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THINGS THAT REQUIRE A MINYAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following require at least 10 men:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>To be Pores Al Shema (to say Kaddish, Borechu, and the first Berachah before Keri'as Shema);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chazaras ha'Shatz (the Shali'ach Tzibur's repetition of Shemoneh Esre);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Birkas Kohanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Keri'as ha'Torah (b'Tzibur);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Haftorah in the Navi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Ma'amad u'Moshav (interruptions during a funeral procession);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>Birkas Avelim (to console mourners);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>A reception line to greet mourners;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>Birkas Chasanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p>'Zimun' with Hash-m's name;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p>Pidyon (redemption) of land or of people.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>For this last case, one of the 10 must be a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> We learn (the first five subjects in the Mishnah) from "V'Nikdashti b'Soch Benei Yisrael", that matters of Kedushah require 10.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Toch-Toch" from Adas Korach; it says there "mi'Toch ha'Edah". We learn "Edah-Edah" from "la'Edah ha'Ra'ah ha'Zos", which refers to the evil Meraglim; there were 10 of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ma'amad u'Moshav requires 10.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because we say 'stop, dear ones', and it is improper to say this to less than 10.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Birkas Avelim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is what is said in the street;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Birkas Avelim requires 10, and mourners do not count towards the 10. Birkas Chasanim requires 10, and the Chasan counts towards the 10.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Zimun with Hash-m's name requires 10.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because we say 'Nevarech lEi'lokeinu', and it is improper to say this amidst less than 10.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Pidyon of land is learned from the 10 times it says "Kohen" in the Parshah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Whenever there are two Mi'utim for the same matter, they come to include (i.e. the last nine need not be Kohanim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should require five Kohanim! (The first "Kohen" requires a Kohen, the second "Kohen" allows a Yisrael. The third "Kohen" requires a Kohen...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Pidyon of man is like of land.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Pidyon applies to man? Man cannot become Hekdesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> One vowed to give to Hekdesh his own value, so he must be evaluated.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who vows his value to Hekdesh is evaluated like a slave.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Slaves are equated to land, therefore 10 are needed.</p></div>
