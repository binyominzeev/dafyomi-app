<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IDENTIFICATION OF CERTAIN CITIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Yochanan identified three cities:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chamas is Teverya. It is called Chamas because of its Chamim (hot springs).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rekes is Tzipori. It is called Rekes because it is elevated, like Riksa (the bank) of a river is above the river.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Kineres is Ginosar. It is called Kineres because its fruit is as sweet as the voice of Kinarei (lyres).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Everyone must agree that Rekes is Teverya!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When someone dies here (in Bavel), they eulogize there (in Teverya) 'He was great in Shishak (Bavel) and famous in Rekes';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When the coffin is sent for burial in Teverya, they eulogize 'Lovers of Yisrael, dwellers of Rekes, go out and receive those killed in the valley!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When R. Zeira died, he was eulogized (in Teverya) 'The land of Shinar (Bavel) conceived and gave birth; Eretz ha'Tzevi (Eretz Yisrael) raised her (Bavel's) delight; 'woe to her' says Rekes, for she has lost her precious vessel!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rava argues with R. Yochanan about two matters:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Rava holds that) Chamas is Chamei (the hot springs of) Gerar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Rava holds that) Rekes is Teverya. It is called Rekes because even the Reikanim (empty people) in it are full of Mitzvos like a pomegranate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah argues:</span> The real name of the city is Rekes; it is called Teverya because it sits b'Tiburah (in the middle) of Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Its name is Rekes; it is called Teverya because Tovah Re'iyasah, its view is good.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Ze'ira):</span> Kitron is Tzipori; it is called Tzipori because it sits at the top of the mountain like a bird.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Kitron cannot be Tzipori, for Kitron is in Zevulun!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Zevulun did not expel the inhabitants of Kitron and Nahalol."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Zevulun Am Charef Nafsho Lamus" - they complained to Hash-m, "Naftoli is on the high fields, the other Shevatim received fields and vineyards, and I received mountains and hills! They received land, and I received seas and rivers!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m answers:</span> All of them will need you for the Chilazon (a fish from which Techeiles, which is needed for Tzitzis, is obtained).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> (Regarding Zevulun's portion it says) "... u'Sfunei Temunei Chol"- Sefunei refers to the Chilazon; Temunei refers to Tiryas (a fish, perhaps what we call tuna); Chol refers to Zechuchis Levanah (a precious crystal).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Zevulun:</span> Who will tell me (if people steal the Chilazon)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> "Sham Yizbechu Zivchei Tzedek" - anyone who steals it will not succeed in his business.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If Kitron is Tzipori, why did Zevulun complain? Tzipori is excellent!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Tzipori is not flowing with milk and honey.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Reish Lakish saw an area 16 Mil by 16 Mil flowing with milk and honey in Tzipori.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the other Shevatim received more such land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> All the land flowing with milk and honey in Eretz Yisrael equals a strip 22 Parsa'os by 6 Parsa'os of 'milk and honey' land (Tzipori has 16 square Parsa'os, which is more than one part in nine of the total)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In any case, Zevulun preferred fields and vineyards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> "v'Naftoli Al Merumei Sadeh".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> "Ekron will be uprooted" refers to Kisari of Edom, which is amidst the sand. It was a dagger to harm Yisrael in the days of the Yevanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the Chashmona'im overpowered the Yevanim, they called it Achidas Migdal Shir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> (Regarding Tzur, the eminent city of Edom, it says) "I will remove his bloods from his mouth and his abominations from between his teeth" - this is Beis Bamya and Beis Galya (their primary idolatries); "and also he will remain to Elokeinu" - these are the Batei Kenesiyos and Batai Medrashos in Edom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>"And it will be like a school in Yehudah, and Ekron will be like Yevusi (Yerushalayim)" - these are the meeting places, in which leaders of Yehudah will publicly teach Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Leshem is Pamyas (the source of the Yarden River); "Ekron will be uprooted" refers to Kisari of Edom, which was the matriarch of kings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say that it is where they raise kings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Others say that it is where kings are appointed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>YISRAEL AND EDOM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Yerushalayim and Kisari cannot both be desolate, nor can both be settled. If one is settled, the other is desolate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> "I will fill the destroyed" - if one is full, the other is destroyed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> We learn from "A nation will overpower the (other) nation."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Yuchan Rasha Bal Lamad Tzedek" - Yitzchak asked Hash-m to be gracious to Esav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> He is evil!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yitzchak:</span> Is there no one  to advocate for him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> "b'Eretz Nechochos Ye'avel" (he will destroy Yerushalayim in the future).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Yitzchak:</span> If so, he should not see the greatness of Hash-m!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Hash-m, do not grant the desires of a Rasha" - Yakov said this regarding Esav.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Do not let him carry out his plot" refers to Germamya of Edom. If they would be released, they would destroy the entire world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama bar Chanina):</span> Germamya has 300 crowned princes, and 365 provinces in Edom. Every day, they confront one another, and kill one of them, and they are busy appointing a new king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Do not believe one who says that he toiled in Torah and did not find (success), nor one who says that he found without toiling.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he says that he toiled and found, believe him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In business all is possible with help from Heaven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Even in Torah, the guarantee is only that anyone who toils will become sharp. He is not guaranteed the Divine help needed to remember the teachings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Al Tischar ba'Mre'im" - if a Rasha is enjoying good fortune, do not confront him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Yachilu Derachav b'Chol Es" - he will constantly succeed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Marom Mishpatecha mi'Negdo" - he will win in his case (Your judgments are removed from him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Kol Tzorerav Yafi'ach ba'Hem" - he will easily defeat his enemies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that we may confront Resha'im in this world - "Those that abandon the Torah praise a Rasha; those that guard the Torah will confront him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Dostoi bar Maton):</span> We may confront Resha'im in this world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Al Tischar ba'Mre'im v'Al Tekanei b'Osei Avlah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One who fears because he has sinned explains the verse to forbid confronting Resha'im. Really, it forbids to desire to be like them or to go in their ways.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> "Al Yekanei Libcha ba'Chata'im".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> One should confront a Rasha in spiritual matters, but not in worldly matters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Both discuss worldly matters; only an absolute Tzadik may confront a Rasha.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Huna):</span> "... B'Vala Rasha Tzadik Mimenu" - a Rasha may swallow one more righteous than himself, but not an absolute Tzadik.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Normally, one may confront a Rasha, but not when he (the Rasha) is enjoying good fortune.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Italya of Yavan is a great city of Rome; it is 300 Parsa'os by 300 Parsa'os;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It has 365 markets, like the number of days in the year. The smallest market is of fowl vendors, which is 16 Mil by 16 Mil.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Each day, the king eats in a market. Whoever lives there (even if not born there), or was born there (even if he does not live there) is fed from the king's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It has 3000 bathhouses, and 500 windows spew smoke outside the wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>It is surrounded by the sea on one side, one side is hills and mountains, one side is an iron barrier, and one side is fine rocks.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHICH <i>HALACHOS</i> APPLY IN EACH ADAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Mishnah:</span> If the Megilah was read in Adar Rishon, and the year was declared a leap year, we read it again in Adar Sheni;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The only differences between Adar Rishon and Sheni are Keri'as ha'Megilah and Matanos l'Evyonim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Adar Rishon and Sheni are the same regarding the four special (Maftir) portions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah is not like any of the three Tana'im of the coming Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the Megilah was read in Adar Rishon, and the year was declared a leap year, we read it again in Adar Sheni. All Mitzvos which apply in Adar Sheni apply in Adar Rishon, except for Keri'as ha'Megilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Yosi says, we do not read it in Adar Sheni, because all Mitzvos that apply in the second apply in the first;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, we also read in Adar Sheni, since all Mitzvos that apply in the second don't apply in the first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Eulogies and fasting are forbidden on the 14th and 15th of both months.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the first Tana and R. Shimon ben Gamliel?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> They argue about the four Parshiyos. The first Tana says that if they were read in Adar Rishon, one need not repeat them; R. Shimon ben Gamliel requires repeating them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The Mishnah is unlike the first Tana, who says that even Matanos l'Evyonim do not apply in Adar Rishon. It is not like R. Eliezer bar R. Yosi, who says that the Megilah may be read in Adar Rishon. It is not like R. Shimon ben Gamliel, who says that even the Parshiyos must be repeated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Really, the Mishnah is like the first Tana. When he says 'except for Keri'as ha'Megilah', he includes Matanos l'Evyonim, since these depend on the reading.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel. It means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The only difference between the 14th of Adar Rishon and Sheni is Keri'as ha'Megilah and Matanos l'Evyonim. They are the same regarding eulogies and fasting; the Mishnah does not discuss the Parshiyos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Eliezer and R. Shimon both learned from the same verse, "In every year and year."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer says, every year we celebrate in the month next to Shevat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, every year we celebrate in the month adjacent to Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We understand R. Eliezer's reason - we do not pass over Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Tavi):</span> It is better to put redemptions close to each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> He learns from "Lekayem Es Igeres ha'Purim ha'Zos <i>ha'Shenis</i>".</p>
