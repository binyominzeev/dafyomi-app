<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>VOWS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only differences between one who is Mudar [forbidden due to a vow] from benefit from Reuven and one who is Mudar not to eat from him are that the former may not walk on Reuven's property or borrow vessels not used for food (which are not normally rented), whereas the latter is permitted (in a place where such Kelim are not rented).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> Neither may borrow vessels used for food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't he walk on Reuven's property? People do not mind!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Eliezer, who forbids Vitur (benefits that people give freely) to one who vowed not to benefit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only difference between Nedarim and Nedavos (vows to bring Korbanos) is that there is Acharayos for Nedarim (one must bring a substitute if the animal cannot be offered) but not for Nedavos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> They are the same regarding 'Bal Te'acher' (the Lav against delaying bringing a Korban).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Neder is when a person says 'Alai' (it is upon me to bring an) Olah; 'this is an Olah' is a Nedavah. If (an animal Hukdash to fulfill) a Neder is stolen, lost or dies, the person must bring another animal; regarding a Nedavah he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> We learn from "V'Nirtza Lo Lechaper <i>Alav.</i>" There is Acharayos only for what is (incumbent) <i>upon</i> a person.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is this learned from the verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Avdimi):</span> Once he says 'Alai', it is as if he bore it on his shoulders.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HALACHOS OF A ZAV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Mishnah:</span> The only difference between a Zav (a man who had emissions from his Ever) who saw two emissions and one who saw three is that the latter must bring a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> They are the same to be Metamei Mishkav and Moshav (vessels special for sitting or lying on), and the need to count seven clean days (i.e. without emissions) to become Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Simai):</span> The Torah calls a Zav Tamei after two sightings, and again after three sightings. We infer that after two sightings he is Tamei, and after three he brings a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps two sightings make him Tamei, but he is exempt from a Korban, and three sightings obligate a Korban, but he is Tahor!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is illogical, for before he sees three he sees two, and he is already Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps after two sightings he brings a Korban, but he is Tahor, and after three sighting he is Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> "The Kohen will atone for him... <i>mi</i>'Zovo (from his emission)" - some Zavim bring Korbanos (those who saw three times), and others (who saw only twice) do not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one who saw twice brings, but one who saw three times does not!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One who saw three times already saw twice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>We need both the teaching of R. Simai and "mi'Zovo":</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Without "mi'Zovo", we would have thought like suggestion (g);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Without R. Simai's teaching, we would not know how many sightings obligate a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If mi'Zovo teaches this, what do we learn from "V'Chi Yithar ha'Zav <i>mi</i>'Zovo"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "V'Chi Yithar ha'Zav" - when his emissions will cease;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"<i>Mi</i>'Zovo" - not from his emissions and Tzara'as (he need not become Tahor from his Tzara'as before counting the days to become Tahor from Zivah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(The adjacency of) "mi'Zovo v'Siper" teaches that a Zav who saw two emissions needs to count seven clean days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know this without a verse!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since he is Metamei Mishkav and Moshav, he certainly (has full Tum'as Zav and) needs seven clean days!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom disproves this assertion. She is Metamei Mishkav and Moshav, but doesn't need seven clean days! Therefore, we need the verse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Here (k:2), mi'Zovo includes a two-emission Zav, but above (h) it excludes a two-emission Zav!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Here this is not needed to exclude, for there is no (other) source to require seven clean days;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We can't learn from Tum'as Mishkav and Moshav, like we said above (m).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps mi'Zovo teaches that he need not become Tahor from his Tzara'as first!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If only that was to be learned, the Torah would have said only "V'Chi Yithar <i>ha'Zav</i>" (ha'Zav would be extra to teach this);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mi'Zovo is extra, to teach that after two sightings, seven clean days are required.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>METZORA MUSGAR  AND MUCHLAT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only differences between a Metzora Musgar (quarantined) and Muchlat (absolute) are tearing clothing and letting his hair grow:</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The only differences between Taharah of a Musgar and a Muchlat are birds and shaving.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> They are the same regarding being sent (from the city) and Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Musgar is exempt from tearing clothing and letting his hair grow?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak):</span> We learn from "V'Tiharo ha'Kohen... <i>v'Taher</i>". The Torah avoids the future (va'Yetaher), to teach that from the onset he was Tahor (exempt) from tearing clothing and letting his hair grow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> It also says "v'Taher" regarding a Zav - regarding what could we say that he was always Tahor?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, there it must mean that now he is Tahor from being Metamei Klei Cheres through moving them. Even if he will see another emission, he is not retroactively Metamei (Klei Cheres that he moved in the meantime, even though he is retroactively Metamei Mishkav u'Moshav and people),</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Also regarding a Metzora, perhaps it teaches that even if the Tzara'as will return, he is not Metamei retroactively through Bi'ah (entering a house).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We learn from "Veha'Tzaru'a Asher <i>Bo</i> ha'Nega" - tearing clothing and letting hair grow only apply to one whose Tzara'as depends on his body (a Muchlat; who is Tamei until the Tzara'as goes away).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It excludes a Musgar, for his Tum'ah depends on days (he can become Tahor after seven days as long as there is no Siman Tum'ah, even if his Tzara'as is still there).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, you should similarly expound "Kol Yemei Asher ha'Nega <i>Vo</i>" to exempt a Musgar from being sent outside the city!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is true!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> The only differences between a Musgar and a Muchlat are tearing clothing and letting his hair grow;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They are the same regarding being sent (from the city) and Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "<i>Kol</i> Yemei is extra to teach that also a Musgar is sent from the city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Musgar does not need birds and shaving to become Tahor?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> "... Nirpa Nega ha'Tzara'as... " - birds and shaving are only needed for one whose Taharah depends on healing of the Tzara'as (this excludes a Musgar, whose Taharah depends on days).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>LANGUAGES IN WHICH SEFORIM, TEFILIN AND MEZUZOS MAY BE WRITTEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only way in which Seforim differ from Tefilin and Mezuzos is that Seforim may be written in any language, but Tefilin and Mezuzos may be written only in Ashuris (Hebrew).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says that the only other language for Seforim is Yevanis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> All of them must be sewn with sinews, and they are Metamei hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Kisvei ha'Kodesh are not Metamei hands if any of the following apply:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mikra (text that should be in Hebrew) was written in Targum (Arameic);''</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Targum was written in Hebrew;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The letters were written Ivri (a different style of writing Hebrew letters).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>They are Metamei hands only if they are written Ashuris (our character set for Hebrew), in a Sefer, and with ink. (Our Mishnah allows any language for Seforim!)</p></div>
