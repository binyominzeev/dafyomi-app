<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>READING IN THE TORAH AND NEVI'IM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not read less than three verses in the Torah. One may not read a second verse until the translator translates the first verse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One may read three verses of Navi at a time, before they are translated. If they are in different Parshiyos, they are read individually.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We may skip while reading in Nevi'im, but not in Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>One may skip only a small amount so that he can roll the Sefer to the new place before the translator finishes translating.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Asi):</span> The three verses correspond to Torah, Nevi'im, and Kesuvim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Mishnah connotes that three consecutive verses can be in three Parshiyos. We find this in Yeshayahu (52:3-5) "Chinam Nimkartem... Mitzrayim Yarad Ami... Ki Lukach Ami". (Ritva - these are not literally three Parshiyos, but they are three different matters.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may skip in the Nevi'im, but not in Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> The Kohen Gadol skips when reading the Torah on Yom Kipur!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (Abaye):</span> He may skip within the time it takes the translator to translate, but no more.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Mishnah said that this is how much one may skip in Nevi'im. This implies that such skipping in Torah is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #2 (Abaye):</span> We may skip in Torah only within one subject.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> We can skip in Torah within one subject. In Navi we may skip to a second subject. In both cases, we may not skip longer than it takes the translator to translate.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may not skip from one Navi to another. This is permitted within Trei Asar (the 12 minor) Nevi'im, but only in forward order.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHO LEADS THE CONGREGATION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The one who usually reads Maftir is Pores Al Shema, Over Lifnei ha'Teivah (repeats Shemoneh Esre out loud), and gives Birkas Kohanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he is a child, his father or Rebbi is Over Lifnei ha'Teivah in his stead.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A child may read the Torah and translate, but he may not be Pores Al Shema, be Over Lifnei ha'Teivah, or give Birkas Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>One whose clothing is torn may be Pores Al Shema or translate, but he may not read in the Torah, be Over Lifnei ha'Teivah, or give Birkas Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>A blind person may be Pores Al Shema or translate;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if he never saw the luminaries he may not be Pores Al Shema.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Why is the Maftir Over Lifnei ha'Teivah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> This is to honor him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar Simi):</span> It is to avoid fights.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In a place where the Shali'ach Tzibur is not paid, honor still applies, but people would not fight to be Over Lifnei ha'Teivah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he is a child, his father or Rebbi goes in his place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the concern is fights, there was no need to enact this, for a child will not fight!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> If the concern is honor, we need not enact to honor a child!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that we want to honor the father or Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Similarly, we are concerned that his father or Rebbi will fight!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ula bar Rav):</span> May a child with torn clothing read the Torah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Why don't you ask about an unclothed person?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely it is forbidden for it is a disgrace to the Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Likewise, a child with torn clothing is a disgrace to the Tzibur!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> One who never saw the luminaries may not be Pores Al Shema.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rabanan (to R. Yehudah)):</span> Many were able to expound about the Merkavah (Hash-m's chariot), even though they never saw it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> That depends on understanding, but to bless on the luminaries one must benefit from them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim hold like R. Yosi:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> I never understood "V'Hayisa Memashesh b'Tzaharayim ka'Asher Yemashesh ha'Iver ba'Afelah" - it makes no difference whether a blind person is in light or in darkness!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Once, I encountered a blind person walking with a torch. He explained that the torch helps others to warn him about pits and thorns.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MUMIM THAT DISQUALIFY A KOHEN FROM BIRKAS KOHANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Kohen who has Mumim on his hands may not Duchan;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah forbids even if his hands are dyed, because people look at him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Mumim on hands, feet and face disqualify a Kohen from Berachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi, and Beraisa):</span> One with white patches on his hands may not bless.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One whose hands are bent (in or to the side) may not bless.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> If one is from a place where people do not speak clearly, he may not Duchan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one is from a place where people pronounce 'Aleph' like 'Ayin' or vice-versa, he may not be Over Lifnei ha'Teivah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chiya (to R. Shimon bar Rebbi):</span> If you were a Levi, your deep voice would disqualify you.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi (to R. Shimon):</span> Tell R. Chiya (who pronounces 'Ches' like 'Hei') that when he reads "V'Chikisi la'Shem" (it sounds like 'v'Hikisi', I hit), he blasphemes!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> One whose eyes drip tears may not bless.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Such a person blessed in Rav Huna's area!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People were used to him. A Beraisa explicitly permits blessing in such a case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Someone blind in one eye may not bless.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Such a person blessed in R. Yochanan's area!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People were used to him. A Beraisa explicitly says that in such a case, he may bless.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Yehudah agrees that if most people in the city work with dye, dyed hands do not disqualify a Kohen from blessing.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF HERESY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who says that he will not be Over Lifnei ha'Teivah in colored clothing or sandals may not be Over Lifnei ha'Teivah even if he changes clothing or removes his sandals;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One who wears round Tefilin is not Yotzei, and it is dangerous (if there is a decree against Tefilin at the time; alternatively, he could bang his head).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>It is the way of heretics to wear Tefilin on the forehead or on the palm. It is the way of outsiders to cover it with gold and put it on the sleeve.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Question):</span> Why may he not be Over Lifnei ha'Teivah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned lest he is a heretic.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is not Yotzei with round Tefilin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah teaches like a Beraisa, which cites a tradition from Sinai that Tefilin must be square.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One must ensure that they remain square when sewing them (the diagonal must be seven fifths as long as the side).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps the Mishnah disqualifies nut-shaped Tefilin (but even round Tefilin are Kosher).</p></div>
