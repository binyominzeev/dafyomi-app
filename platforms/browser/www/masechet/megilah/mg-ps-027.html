<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE KEDUSHAH OF BATEI KENESIYOS AND BATEI MEDRASHOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papi citing Rava):</span> One may convert a Beis ha'Keneses into a Beis Medrash, but not vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Rava said just the contrary!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha):</span> Presumably, Rav Papi is correct, for R. Yehoshua ben Levi permits to convert a Beis ha'Keneses into a Beis Medrash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Bar Kapara):</span> (Nevuzaradan burned) "Beis Hash-m" - the Beis ha'Mikdash; "Beis ha'Melech" - the king's palace; "v'Es Kol Batei Yerushalayim" - all houses of Yerushalayim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi or R. Yochanan):</span> [He burned also] "V'Es Kol Beis Gadol" - where we cultivate Torah (a Beis Medrash) - "Yagdil Torah v'Yadir";</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of R. Yehoshua ben Levi and R. Yochanan):</span> It refers to where we cultivate Tefilah (a Beis ha'Keneses) - "Ha'Gedolos Asher Asah Elisha";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Elisha performed his wonders through prayer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Since R. Yehoshua ben Levi permits to convert a Beis ha'Keneses into a Beis Medrash, he must hold that it (Beis Gadol) is a Beis Medrash.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MAY WE TRANSFER TO THE SAME KEDUSHAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May we sell an old Sefer Torah to buy a new one?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since we do not raise the Kedushah, it is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or perhaps, since there is no higher Kedushah, it is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah forbids to sell a Sefer Torah to buy Seforim. This implies that we may sell it to buy a Sefer Torah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is b'Di'eved (if it was already sold). The question is whether or not we may sell l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> We may wrap a Sefer Torah with covers of Chumashim, and we may wrap Chumashim with covers of Nevi'im or Kesuvim. We may not wrap Nevi'im or Kesuvim with covers of Chumashim, nor Chumashim with covers of a Sefer Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Reisha implies that we may not wrap a Sefer Torah with the cover of a different Sefer Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Seifa implies that we may!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The inferences contradict one another. We cannot resolve our question from this Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> We may put a Sefer Torah on a Sefer Torah or on Chumashim (the same or a lower Kedushah); we may not put a Sefer on a Sefer of higher Kedushah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like we may put one Sefer Torah on another, so too we may sell one to buy another.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from there, for when Seforim are written together in one parchment that is rolled, perforce Seforim rest on Seforim. Therefore we always allow Seforim to rest on Seforim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Rabah bar bar Chanah forbids to sell an old Sefer Torah to buy a new one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, the concern is that he will neglect to buy a new one. Our question is when the new one is ready (to be sold, and he needs only to give the money).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5:</span> R. Yochanan permits to sell a Sefer Torah only to learn Torah or to marry a woman. This shows that one may sell Torah for Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps one may sell for Talmud Torah or to get married (and fulfill Peru u'Revu), because learning brings to fulfilling Mitzvos, and "(The world) was created to be settled (with people)", but one may not sell to buy a Sefer Torah. (The question is left unresolved.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not sell a Sefer Torah even though he doesn't need it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, even if one lacks what to eat and sells a Sefer Torah or his daughter (to be a slave), he will see no Berachah from the money!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>LEFTOVER MONEY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The same applies to excess money (it may not be used for a lower Kedushah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This refers to excess money from a sale, but if they collected money (to buy something Kodesh), the extra money has no restrictions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If a condition was made, it may be used even for a Duchsusya (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This cannot discuss a sale, for a condition would not help for the excess!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It must discuss a collection. This shows that without a condition, the extra money has Kedushah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it was a sale. If the seven overseers of the city made a condition, the extra money may be used for Duchsusya.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye (to a Chacham who used to recite Mishnayos in front of Rav Sheshes):</span> Did you hear Rav Sheshes explain what is Duchsusya?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">The Chacham:</span> He said that it is a horseman to run errands for the city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> If a Talmid does not understand what he heard, he should ask one who is frequently  by Chachamim, for surely he heard the explanation from a great Chacham.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan, and a Beraisa):</span> If people of a city went to a different city, and they imposed on them to give an amount to Tzedakah, they must give (deposit it with the Gabai). When they return, they take back (from the Gabai) the money and give it to the poor of their city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An individual does not take back his Tzedakah. It goes to the poor of the city he went to. (Me'iri - some say that less than 10 is considered an individual.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Rav Huna declared a Ta'anis. People of Rav Chana bar Chanilai's city came. Tzedakah was imposed on them, and they gave. When they were leaving, they wanted to take the money to the poor of their city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Rav Huna refused;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This (they take back their Tzedakah) is when there is no Chacham appointed over the communal needs. When there is a Chacham, all is done as he sees fit.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>All the more so here Rav Huna decides, because the poor of both cities rely on him!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SELLING A BEIS HA'KENESES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> We may not sell a public Beis ha'Keneses to an individual, since this lessens its Kedushah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> It is permitted. If it was forbidden, one could not sell even from a large city to a small city!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Question):</span> How does R. Meir answer the Chachamim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He says that a Beis ha'Keneses of a small city also has Kedushah, but that of an individual does not;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Chachamim say, if we are concerned for the decrease in Kedushah, we should also be concerned from a big city to a small city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> We may sell a Beis ha'Keneses only on condition that it can be bought back;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Chachamim say, it may be sold permanently, except for 4 things, i.e. to be a bathhouse, tannery, Mikveh, or Beis ha'Mayim (laundry, or a place to urinate).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, we sell it to be a courtyard. The buyer then does like he wants.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Question):</span> According to R. Meir, there is a problem of usury (if it is bought back, the buyer lived there without paying rent. This is interest on his money!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> R. Meir holds like R. Yehudah, who permits a sale that might result in usury:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven sold his field to his creditor Shimon:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is permitted only if Reuven eats the fruits, but not if Shimon eats them;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehudah says that Shimon may eat the fruits; R. Elazar ben Azaryah sanctioned such a sale.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No, the case was, Reuven ate the fruit.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They argue about whether a sale that might result in usury is allowed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> No, all forbid a sale that might result in usury;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> They argue about whether we permit such a sale on condition to return the interest if the field will be bought back. (R. Meir holds like R. Yehudah, who permits.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may urinate within four Amos of where he prayed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> We already know this from the Mishnah! R. Yehudah permits one who buys a Beis ha'Keneses to do as he pleases, and Chachamim forbid making it a Beis ha'Mayim only because it used to be a fixed place of prayer!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> All permit to urinate four Amos away from a place of prayer that was not fixed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> One who prayed must distance four Amos before urinating. One who urinated must distance four Amos before praying.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Granted, the Seifa is like a Mishnah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not pray within four Amos of urine or excrement.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> Why must one distance four Amos from a place of prayer? If so, one may not urinate in any street of our city (travelers have prayed)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the (entire) Beraisa discusses waiting the time needed to walk four Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand the Seifa; one waits to ensure that all drops are absorbed (in his garment - Ran) before praying.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, why must one wait after praying before urinating?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The words of prayer are still on his lips for this period of time.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>ATTRIBUTES OF CHACHAMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Zakai attributed his long life to the following merits:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He never urinated within four Amos of praying; he never made a nickname for someone; he never missed making Kidush on wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Once, his elderly mother sold her kerchief to buy for him wine for Kidush.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When she died, she left him 300 barrels of wine. When he died, he left 3000 to his children.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rav Huna gave his belt for a security to obtain wine for Kidush.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When Rav heard this, he blessed him that he should be covered with silk.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This was fulfilled. Rav was upset that at the time Rav Huna had not returned the Berachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Elazar ben Shamu'a attributed his long life to these merits:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He never used a Beis ha'Keneses to be a shortcut; he never appeared to walk on the heads of Talmidim; he never said Birkas Kohanim without blessing first.</p></div>
