<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE MALE PROPHETS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa listed eight Nevi'im Kohanim. Regarding some we do not find that they themselves prophesized, only that their sons were Nevi'im. What is the source that the fathers were also Nevi'im?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ula taught that the father of a Navi was also a Navi if and only if the father's name mentioned with his son's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If his city is mentioned, he was from that city; if not, he was from Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When a man and his ancestors are mentioned:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the deeds of one are praised, this applies to all listed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Devar Hash-m Asher Hayah El Tzefanyah ben Kushi ben Gedalyah" - this shows that he and his father (and grandfather) were Tzadikim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the deeds of one are degraded, this applies to all listed.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Yishmael ben Nesanyah ben Elishama" - he and his fathers were Resha'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Malachi is Mordechai. He is called Malachi because he was second to the Melech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Baruch ben Neriyah, Serayah ben Ma'asiyah, Daniel, Mordechai-Bilshan, Chagi, Zecharyah and Malachi, all prophecized in the second year of Daryavesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Nachman is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Yehoshua ben Korchah says, Malachi is Ezra;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Chachamim say, Malachi is his name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> R. Yehoshua's opinion is better, since it says in Malachi "Bogdah Yehudah... u'Vo'al Vas Ben Nechar";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ezra separated Benei Yisrael from their Nochri wives - "Shechanyah... said to Ezra... we put foreign women in our homes" (and Ezra made Yisrael swear to expel them).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE FOUR BEAUTIFUL WOMEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There were four exceedingly beautiful women in the world - Sarah, Avigayil, Rachav and Esther.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The opinion that says that Esther was green substitutes Vashti for Esther.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Immorality (of one level or another) resulted from the following - Rachav's name, Ya'el's voice (it seduced Sisera), Avigayil's mention (that David should marry her), and Michal bas Sha'ul through being seen (Maharsha - this is why she was reluctant to go outside to rebuke David).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Anyone who says Rachav, Rachav immediately has an emission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> I can say it and it won't affect me!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak:</span> I refer to people who knew (Tosfos Ta'anis 5a - had relations with her) and recognized her.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ESTHER GOES TO THE KING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "And Mordechai knew everything that happened" - i.e. that Haman exceeded Achashverosh (regarding his evil plans for Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The higher king overpowered the lower king (this is a euphemism for the opposite).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> <i>Va'Tischalchal</i> ha'Malkah" - what does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> She became a Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> She needed to move her bowels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Hasach" is Daniel. He is called Hasach because Chatchuhu (they cut him) from his greatness (which he had under the previous kings);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He is called Hasach because all royal matters Nichtachin (are executed) through him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Lada'as Al Mah Zeh v'Al Mah Zeh" - she suggested that perhaps Yisrael transgressed the five Chumashim, in which it says "Mi'Zeh umi'Zeh Hem Kesuvim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>"They told the words of Esther to Mordechai" - Hasach did not tell him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that one should not report back when his mission fails (Esther refused to go to the king).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> "Asher Lo cha'Das" - until now, she was forced to be with the king. This time, she would go willingly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>"V'Cha'asher Avadti Avadti" - just like I was lost from my father's house (orphaned), I am lost to you (as a wife, for now I go willingly to Achashverosh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Va'Ya'avor Mordechai" - He'evir (he passed) the first day of Pesach in a Ta'anis (like Esther decreed, even though the Torah commands to eat Matzah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Avar (he crossed) a stream (to gather Jews to fast).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "Ba'Yom ha'Shelishi Va'Tilbash Esther Malchus"? It should say 'Bigdei Malchus'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> Rather, Ru'ach ha'Kodesh clothed her. It says here "Va'Tilbash", like it says "V'Ru'ach Lavshah Es Amasai."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>DERASHOS</i> OF REBBI ELAZAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Berachah of a commoner should not be light in your eyes. Two leaders of their generations were blessed by commoners, and the Berachos were fulfilled, i.e. David and Daniel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Aronah blessed David - "Aravna said to the king (you should find favor with Hash-m)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Daryavesh blessed Daniel - "Elokecha... will save you (from the lions)"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The curse of a commoner should not be light in your eyes. Avimelech cursed Sarah (he was upset that he needed to pay and return her) "this is to you a covering of the eyes", and it was fulfilled in her seed - "When Yitzchak grew old, his eyes weakened."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Hash-m's ways are unlike the ways of people. A person sets a pot (on an oven), then fills it with water. Hash-m fills it with water and then sets it down, to fulfill "The sound of His giving much water in Shamayim (and he brings up (full) clouds from the ends of the land)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Whoever repeats something in the name of the one who said it brings redemption to the world - "Esther told the king in the name of Mordechai."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> When a Tzadik dies, he is lost to his generation (but he himself is elevated to the world to come). This is like a man who lost a jewel. Wherever it is, it is a jewel; it is lost only to the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> When Haman saw Mordechai sitting in the gate of the king, he said "V'Chol Zeh Einenu Shaveh Li";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Mordechai came with his Pruzbul (wealth), and Haman came with his Pruzbuti (poverty. Yalkut Esther, brought in Etz Yosef - previously, Haman had no food and had to sell himself to be Mordechai's slave. Mordechai told him that anything a slave acquires belongs to his master.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Mordechai called him 'a slave that was sold for bread.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>"And all this is not worth to me" teaches that all his treasures were carved on his heart, and when he saw Mordechai sitting in the gate of the king, he said "And all this is not worth to me."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "On that day Hash-m will be l'Ateres Tzevi ..." - He will be a crown on the head of every Tzadik.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>"L'Ateres Tzevi ul'Tzefiras Tif'arah" - this is for those who do Tzivyono (His will) ul'Metzapin Tif'arto (and look forward to His glory).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is for everyone!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "L'Sheir Amo (to the remnant of his nation)", to one who makes himself like Shirayim (leftovers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>"And to a spirit of judgment" - this is one who judges his Yetzer (desires).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>"And to one who sits on the judgment" is one who judges a case to its ultimate truth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>"Ul'Gevurah" is one who overcomes his Yetzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>"Meshivei Milchamah" - they (answer and) debate in the war of Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>"To the gate" are Chachamim who come early (when they open the gates of) Batei Kenesiyos and Batei Medrash and leave (when they lock the gates).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Midas ha'Din:</span> How are these different than these? (Etz Yosef - since the Tzadikim did not rebuke the Resha'im, they are no better! According to the Medrash, the following answer distinguishes between Yisraelim who learned and those who did not.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> Yisrael engaged in Torah, the other nations did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Midas ha'Din:</span> These also stumbled in wine and beer, and were judged for Gehenom. (According to the text in Sanhedrin 111b, Hash-m said this; unworthy judges were duly punished.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Paku" connotes Gehenom - "This should not be for you l'Fuka (a pitfall)".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Peliliyah" connotes judges - "V'Nosan bi'Flilim".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>ESTHER COMES TO THE KING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> "Esther stood in the inner courtyard of the king's house"- when she reached the place where the idols are kept, Ru'ach ha'Kodesh departed from her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>"Keli Keli Lamah Azavtani" - do You judge Shogeg like Mezid, and Ones like Ratzon? (I am coerced to come here for the sake of Yisrael!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Is it because I called Achashverosh a dog ("Save my soul from a sword, from a dog")?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>She retracted, and called him a lion - "Save me from the mouth of the lion."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> When the king saw Esther, three angels came. One raised her neck, one stretched a string of Chesed over her, and one stretched the scepter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> The scepter was two Amos, and it stretched to 12. Some say that it stretched to  16, and some say to 24.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It stretched to 60.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Similarly, Paro's daughter's hand stretched [60 Amos] to reach Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, the teeth of the wicked elongate [60 Amos] - "The teeth of the wicked Shibarta (you broke)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> We read this Shirvavta (you increased).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Ufran):</span> It stretched to 200.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Achashverosh offered to Esther "Up to Chetzi (half) the kingdom", but not the whole kingdom, nor something that is Chotzetz (divides) the kingdom, i.e. building the Mikdash (which is in the middle of the world).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>WHY DID ESTHER INVITE HAMAN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Why did Esther invite Haman?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Eliezer):</span> She set Pachim (traps) for him - "Yehi Shulchanam Lifneihem l'Fach".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehoshua):</span> "If your enemy is hungry, feed him bread. (... You scoop coals on his head)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Meir):</span> This was so he would not take counsel and rebel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Yehudah):</span> It was so they shouldn't know that she is a Yisraelis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (R. Nechemyah):</span> It was so Yisrael should not say 'we have a sister in the palace' and slacken from prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (R. Yosi):</span> It was so Haman should be always available to her (to make him stumble).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #7 (R. Shimon ben Menasiya):</span> She thought, perhaps Hash-m will feel (my disgrace that I need to flatter a Rasha) and do a miracle for us.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #8 (R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> She planned to get herself and Haman killed. (The custom was to cancel a decree if one of the authors died.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #9 (R. Gamliel):</span> Achashverosh is wishy-washy (if he agrees to kill Haman and does not do so immediately, he might change his mind).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Gamliel):</span> We need the (coming) answer of R. Eliezer ha'Moda'i (it is the best).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #10 (R. Eliezer ha'Moda'i):</span> She wanted that the king and ministers will envy Haman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #11 (Rabah):</span> "Pride precedes a fall."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #12 (Abaye and Rava):</span> "I will set their feasts with poison" (the wicked are punished through their feasts. Maharsha - she wanted Haman and Achashverosh to be punished. This is unlike R. Eliezer (b), who explains that she only sought to make Haman fall.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Eliyahu told Rabah bar Avuha that she invited him for all these reasons.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">7)</span>THE DOWNFALL OF HAMAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Haman told them of his honor, wealth, and many sons" - he had 30 sons. Ten died, 10 were hung, and 10 begged for bread;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> Seventy begged for bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Aba):</span> In all, he had 208, like the Gematriya of "v'Rov".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Gematriya is 214!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> "V'Rov" is written lacking a Vov, so the Gematriya is 208.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum):</span> "That night, the <i>king's</i> sleep was disturbed" refers to Hash-m. (At the beginning of the Gra's Perush on the Megilah, he says that whenever it says "the king" without "Achashverosh", it hints to Hash-m. Perhaps R. Tanchum teaches that here, the simple meaning refers to Hash-m. Kad ha'Kemach - this is just a metaphor, for Hash-m does not sleep.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> Achashverosh's sleep was disturbed; also the angels were up (provoking him to reward Mordechai, or requesting mercy);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span>  Achashverosh was up. He wondered, why is Esther inviting Haman? Perhaps they are plotting to kill me! If so, why didn't anyone tell me? Perhaps I neglected to reward someone for a favor, therefore, no one is telling me! Immediately, the king asked to bring the chronicles.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>"Va'Yihyu Nikra'im" - they were being read by themselves! (The servant who asked to read them did not want to mention that Mordechai saved the king's life.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yimatzei Chasuv" (this connotes that <i>now</i> it was found written) - it should have said 'Kesav'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span>  Shimshai (a scribe who hated Yisrael) erased (what Mordechai did), and Gavri'el rewrote it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> If mortal writing for the merit of Yisrael is not erased, all the more so writing of Heaven is not erased!</p>
