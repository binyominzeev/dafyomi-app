<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN PRIVATE <i>BAMOS</i> ARE ALLOWED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yitzchak):</span> I heard that we may offer Korbanos in Beis Chonyo (a place of Avodah in Mitzrayim) nowadays.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that Beis Chonyo is not a house of idolatry. He also holds that the initial Kedushah of Yerushalayim was not permanent, so Bamos are permitted after the Churban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He learns from "You have not yet come to the Menuchah (rest) and to the Nachalah (inheritance)". Menuchah and Nachalah refer to Shilo and Yerushalayim, respectively.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This equates Shilo and Yerushalayim. Just like Bamos were permitted after Shilo, they were permitted after Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Did you say that?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak:</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> I swear that he did say it, and I learned it from him! He retracted because of Rav Mari's question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Mari - Mishnah):</span> Bamos were permitted after Shilo, but not after Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Mishnah):</span> Once the Mikdash was built in Yerushalayim, Bamos were prohibited and were never permitted again. This was the "Nachalah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to both questions):</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not Kedushas Yerushalayim still applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> I heard that when they were building the Mikdash, they made curtains for (the areas that will be enclosed by) the Heichal and the Azarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Heichal walls were built outside its curtains; the Azarah walls were built inside its curtains.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> I heard that we may offer Korbanos even without a Temple, and eat Kodshei Kodoshim even without curtains, and eat Kodshim Kalim and Maaser Sheni, even though there is no wall (around Yerushalayim), because Kedushas Yerushalayim was permanent.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Eliezer holds that (curtains were needed because) the Kedushah ceased!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Ravina):</span> Perhaps both hold that the Kedushah was permanent. Each Tana said what he heard.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, how does R. Eliezer explain why there were curtains?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were merely for Tzni'us (places of Kedushah should not be so exposed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The following Tana'im argue about whether or not the Kedushah ended. (A Mishnah (Erchin 32a) lists walled cities - old Ketzarah of Tzipori... )</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> Chachamim listed cities that the returning exiles (from Bavel) were Mekadesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The first Kedushah ceased when the Kedushah of Eretz Yisrael ceased (after the first Churban).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This shows that R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi holds that the first Kedushah ceased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> The cities listed are not the only walled cities. Moshe conquered "Shishim Ir... Mamleches Og... Betzuros Chomah!" The Mishnah lists only the cities that the returning exiles found and were Mekadesh.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> The Seifa (of this Beraisa, brought below) says that they did not need to be Mekadesh them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, we list cities known to have had a wall;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If there is a tradition about another city that it had a wall when Yehoshua entered Eretz Yisrael, the Mitzvos of walled cities (one who sells a house has a year to redeem it, a Metzora cannot stay there) also applies to it, because the first Kedushah was permanent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This contradicts what R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi said in the above Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Tana'im argue about his opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Tana of the Tosefta is really R. <i>Eliezer</i> bar Yosi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer bar Yosi):</span> "Asher Lo Chomah" - ("Lo" is written with an Aleph, to include) even if it does not have a wall now, if it once had one!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>VA'YEHI</i> CONNOTES PAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> We have a tradition from Anshei Keneses ha'Gedolah that 'va'Yehi' (and it was) always denotes pain"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Yehi bi'Ymei Achashverosh" there was Haman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Va'Yehi bi'Ymei Shefot ha'Shoftim" there was a famine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Va'Yehi that man began to multiply" - "Hash-m saw that great is the evil of man."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Va'Yehi when they traveled from the east" - "Let us build a city."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"Va'Yehi in the days of Amrafel they made war."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>"Va'Yehi Yehoshua biYricho" - "His sword drawn in his hand."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>"Va'Yehi Hash-m Im Yehoshua" - "Benei Yisrael transgressed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>"Va'Yehi Ish me'Ramasayim" - Chanah was barren.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>"Va'Yehi when Shmuel grew old" - "His sons did not go in his ways."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>"Va'Yehi David was succeeding in all his ways and Hash-m was with him" - "Sha'ul put his eye on David".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>"Va'Yehi when the king sat in his house" - "But you will not build the Beis ha'Mikdash."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says, "Va'Yehi on the eighth day (of Chanukas ha'Mishkan)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> That day there was a Simchah in front of Hash-m like the day Heaven and earth were created.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In both places it says "va'Yehi."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Nadav and Avihu died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yehi in the 480th year (the Beis ha'Mikdash was completed)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yehi when Yakov saw Rachel"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yehi evening and it was morning, one day"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is also the second day, the third day, and more!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> "Va'Yehi" is sometimes good, and sometimes painful. "Va'Yehi bi'Ymei is always pain. In five places it says "Va'Yehi bi'Ymei":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Yehi bi'Ymei Achashverosh", "Va'Yehi bi'Ymei Shefot ha'Shoftim", "Va'Yehi bi'Ymei Amrafel", "Va'Yehi bi'Ymei Achaz", and "Va'Yehi bi'Ymei Yehoyakim."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TRADITIONS OF R. LEVI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> We have a tradition that Amotz and Amatzyah are brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches like Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani, that a Kalah who is modest in her father-in-law's house merits that kings and Nevi'im will descend from her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from Tamar - "Yehudah saw her and thought that she was a harlot because she covered her face".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Normally a harlot does not cover her face!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, because she <i>had</i> covered her face in his house he didn't recognize her now, and she merited that kings and Nevi'im would descend from her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Kings descended from her, i.e. (all kings of Beis) David;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Nevi'im descended from her, like R. Levi taught, that Amotz was the brother of Amatzyah (a king of Beis David), and it says "Chazon Yeshayahu ben Amotz". (Since Yeshayahu's lineage is traced to his father, this shows that also his father was a Navi - Megilah 15a.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Levi:</span> We have a tradition that the Aron did not take up any space!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Support - Beraisa):</span> There were 10 Amos from Moshe's Aron (until the wall) in each direction;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "V'Lifnei ha'Devir Esrim Amah." (Turei Even deletes the verse of the Cheruvim from the text, for it has no relevance to what we are proving.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>There was no space for the Aron! This shows that it stood miraculously.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PRELUDES TO <i>MEGILAS ESTHER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>When R. Yonason would expound the Megilah, he would begin "And I will rise upon them ... and I will cut off from Bavel Shem v'Sheir v'Nin v'Neched";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Shem" is the writing, "Sheir" is the language, "Nin" is the kingship, and "Neched" (grandchild) is Vashti.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Shmuel bar Nachmani would begin to expound with "In place of ha'Na'atzutz will rise b'Rosh; in place of Sarpad will rise Hadas";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Na'atzutz' is Haman ha'Rasha, who made himself an idol;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Idolatry is called Na'atzutz - "In all the Na'atzutzim and in all the barren trees."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'Rosh' is Mordechai, who is called the first of the spices (used for Shemen ha'Mishchah) - "Kach Lecha Besamim Rosh Mar Deror... ";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Targum of "Mar Deror" is Mari Dachi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"SaRPaD" is Vashti ha'Resha'ah, the granddaughter of Nevuchadnetzar ha'Rasha, who burned ReFiDas Beis Hash-m (the Beis ha'Mikdash) - "Refidaso Zahav".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Hadas" is Esther, who is called Hadasah - "And he raised Hadasah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"V'Hayah la'Shem l'Shem" - this is Keri'as ha'Megilah (Maharsha - Hash-m's name is not in the Megilah, but it is mentioned when we bless on reading the Megilah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"For an eternal sign that will not be cut off" - these are the days of Purim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Levi would begin to expound with "And it will be, like Hash-m rejoiced over you to do good to you, so He will rejoice over you to do evil to you."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Hash-m does not rejoice at the downfall of the wicked!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "(Yehoshafat appointed singers, and) when they went out to war they would say 'Hodu la'Shem Ki l'Olam Chasdo'". 'Ki Tov' is omitted, because Hash-m does not rejoice at the downfall of the wicked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan) Question:</span> What does it mean "V'Lo Karav Zeh El Zeh Kol ha'Laylah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The angels wanted to sing (this is like "V'Kara Zeh El Zeh"), but Hash-m said to them 'the works of My hands are drowning in the sea, and you sing?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> Hash-m does not rejoice, but He makes others rejoice (to punish the wicked).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> (Regarding punishing) it says "Yasis" (He will make rejoice), not 'Yasos' (He will rejoice).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Aba bar Kahana would begin with "L'Adam she'Tov Lefanav Nosan Chachmah v'Da'as v'Simchah" - this is Mordechai ha'Tzadik;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"To the sinner He gave the desire to gather and store" - this is Haman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"To give (the stored wealth) to whom is good in front of Hash-m" - this is Mordechai and Esther, "And Esther put Mordechai over the house of Haman."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Raba bar Ufron would begin with "And I put My throne in Ilam, and I destroyed from there a king and nobles" - "king" refers to Vashti, and "nobles" refers to Haman and his 10 sons.</p>
