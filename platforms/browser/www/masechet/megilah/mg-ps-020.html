<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah himself permits l'Chatchilah; Beraisa #1 is like his Rebbi, who says that b'Di'eved one was Yotzei:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah citing R. Eliezer ben Azaryah):</span> One must read Keri'as Shema audibly to his ears, for it says "Shema" - Mashmi'a (make heard);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir says "Al Levavecha" - it depends on intention in the heart.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We may now rebut Rejection #3:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds like his Rebbi (one is Yotzei b'Di'eved); R. Yehudah brei d'R. Shimon ben Pazi holds as R. Meir, who permits l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah permits a child.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> When I was a child, I read in front of R. Tarfon and other Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We may not bring a proof from what one remembers when he was a child.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> When I was a child, I read in front of R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> This is no proof, he is the lenient opinion!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't they respond that we cannot bring a proof from childhood?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A second rebuttal was given; they rejected his proof for both reasons.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DAYTIME MITZVOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following should be done only after sunrise:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Keri'as ha'Megilah, circumcision, Tevilah, Haza'ah (sprinkling water on which ashes of Parah Adumah were put), also the Tevilah of a Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom (a woman who saw blood during one or two of the days of Zivah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If any of them was done after dawn, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Question):</span>  What is the source (for Keri'as ha'Megilah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "These days ...."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah refutes R. Yehoshua ben Levi, who said that we must read the Megilah at night as well!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Mishnah teaches about the day reading.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>We learn that circumcision is by day from "On the eighth day".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>We learn about sprinkling from "On the seventh day". Tevilah is equated to sprinkling.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was it necessary to teach Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom separately from others that are Tovel?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would have thought it is like the first sighting of a Zav (a man who had emissions from his Ever), which is compared to a Ba'al Keri (one who had a seminal emission);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Ba'al Keri may be Tovel the same as the emission. A Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom cannot do so, for it says "Kol Yemei Zovah k'Mishkav Nidasah <i>Yihyeh</i> Lah" (this obligates Shmirah, i.e. to wait one day (without blood) before Tevilah. A partial day is considered like a full day);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had the Mishnah not taught Shomeres Yom separately, we would think that Shmirah of the start of the coming night would suffice, and she could be Tovel at night.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. She must <i>count</i> (a clean day), and counting must be by day, therefore she cannot be Tovel until day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If any of these was done after dawn, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rava):</span> We learn this from "Va'Yikra Elokim la'Or Yom" - from when it is Me'ir (illuminates) is called day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, we should similarly learn from "Vela'Choshech Kora Laylah" that night begins when it starts to get dark, but we hold that night does not begin until Tzeis ha'Kochavim (when stars are visible)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (R. Zeira):</span> We learn from "We work ... from dawn until Tzeis ha'Kochavim" and "We watched at night, and worked by day."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the second verse needed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have thought that they worked extra, even before the start of day.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>We learn about Viduy Ma'aser from "This day Hash-m commands you."</p></div>
