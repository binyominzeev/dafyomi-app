<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IMPROPER WAYS TO PRAISE HASH-M</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> To say 'Good ones will bless you' is heretical;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We silence one who says 'Your are merciful on a bird's nest', 'Your name will be mentioned on the good', or 'Modim, Modim';</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We silence one who distorts the Isurim of Arayos;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If one explains "Umi'Zar'acha Lo Siten l'Molech" to mean relations with a Nochris, we firmly silence him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> We understand that saying 'Modim, Modim' looks like worshipping two powers;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>We also understand the problem with 'Your name will be mentioned on good';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One must bless on the bad just like he blesses on the good.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is wrong about 'You are merciful on a bird's nest'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi bar Avin or R. Yosi bar Zevida):</span> This arouses jealousy of the other animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of R. Yosi bar Avin and R. Yosi bar Zevida):</span> This suggests that Hash-m's Mitzvos are mercy. Really, they are decrees above our understanding.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>A man said 'You had mercy on a bird's nest, be merciful upon us!' Rabah praised him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> The Mishnah says that we silence him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rabah was only testing Abaye.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>A man came in front of R. Chanina and said 'Hashem who is great, awesome, mighty, strong and vigorous.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> Have you finished His praises? We may say 'ha'Gadol ha'Gibor veha'Nora' only because the Torah says it, and the Great Assembly fixed the text!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one has billions of  gold coins, it denigrates him to say that he has silver.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> "What does Hash-m ask of you, just to fear Him" - all is in Hash-m's hands, except for fear of Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse implies that fearing Hash-m is a small matter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Correct! For (Kli Yakar - people near) Moshe, it is simple!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">A parable:</span> If one is asked to lend a big Keli, if he has it, he considers this a small request. If one is asked for something he lacks, even if it is a small Keli, this is like a big request.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> One who says Shema, Shema is like one who says 'Modim, Modim'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> It is despicable to read Shema and double it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It does not say that we silence him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> R. Zeira discusses one who repeats the entire verse (it looks like he accepts two authorities). The Beraisa discusses one who repeats each word.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rif) Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses one who repeats the entire verse (it looks like he did not intend the first time). R. Zeira discusses one who repeats each word.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps he didn't have intent the first time, therefore he repeats it with intent!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Does he treat Hash-m like a peer, so he repeats himself and shows that he spoke to Him without intent?! He should be smacked until he has intent!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We silence one who distorts the Isurim of Arayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> For example, he says that "Ervas Avicha" and "Ervas Imecha" refer to the shame of your father and mother.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(v)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one explains "Umi'Zar'acha Lo Siten l'Molech" (to mean relations with a Nochris ...)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> He explains that the Isur is to father a son who will serve idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PARSHIYOS THAT WE READ OR TRANSLATE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We read and translate the episode of Tamar and Yehudah, and the first account of the golden calf;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We read but do not translate the episode of Reuven; the second account of the Egel, Birkas Kohanim, and the episode of David and Amnon;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We do not read about the Merkavah (in Yechezkeil) for the Haftorah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, we do not read "Hoda Es Yerushalayim" for the Haftorah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara -Beraisa):</span> The following are read and translated:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Ma'aseh Bereishis;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously we read and translate this!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we do not (read or translate it), lest people ask what above [the sky] or below [the earth], or past the ends of the world (alternatively - what was before Creation, or will be after the world ceases). The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The episode of Lot and his daughters;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One might have thought that because of the honor of Avraham we do not (read the disgrace of his nephew).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The episode of Tamar and Yehudah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One might have thought that we do not, for it is disgraceful for Yehudah. The Beraisa teaches to the contrary; it is praiseworthy that he confessed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The first account of the Egel;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We might have thought that we do not because of the honor of Yisrael. The Beraisa teaches to the contrary, it is good for Yisrael to (be ashamed and) get atonement!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Klalos and Berachos;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One might have thought we do not, lest this cause people serve out of love (of reward) and fear (of punishment).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Warnings and punishments;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One might have thought that we do not, lest it make people despair (and seek pleasures before they will be punished).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>The episodes of Amnon and Tamar, and of Avshalom;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We might have thought that we do not, because of the honor of David.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>The episode of Pilegesh b'Giv'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We might have thought that we do not, because of the honor of Binyamin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>"Hoda Es Yerushalayim - "Inform Yerushalayim of its abominations";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously we read and translate it!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is unlike R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>A man once read this for the Haftorah. R. Eliezer said, 'before checking Yerushalayim's corruption, check your mother's!' People checked and found a Pesul in his lineage. (Ritva - even if he held like Chachamim, one should act like R. Eliezer in R. Eliezer's region.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>PARSHIYOS THAT ARE READ BUT NOT TRANSLATED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> The following are read but not translated:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The episode of Reuven;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Chanina ben Gamliel once told a translator to translate only the end of the verse ("There were 12 sons of Yakov"); R. Chanina was praised for this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The second account of the Egel;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> A person must be careful how he answers. Aharon answered Moshe that the calf came from the fire; this made heretics more brazen (to say that idolatry has power).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Birkas Kohanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We do not translate it because it says that Hash-m shows partiality. (People do not know why it is fitting for Him to show partiality to Yisrael.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The episode of David and Amnon.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said earlier that this is translated!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We translate only where Amnon is not called the son of David.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We substitute less explicit words for blatant derogatory words:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We say Yishkavenah in place of Yishgalenah, ba'Techorim in place of ba'Apolim, Divyonim in place of Chiryonim, Tzo'asam in place of Choreihem, Meimei  Ragleihem in place of Meimei Shineihem, l'Motza'os in place of l'Machara'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah says, we read l'MaCHaRa'os (as it is) because this disgraces idolatry (Beis ha'Ba'al was made into a Beis ha'Kisei; CHoR alludes to the anus).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Scoffing is permitted only regarding idolatry. We learn from "Kora Bel Kores Nevo... ; Lo Yochlu Malet Masa" (the idols fell; they were unable to reach the Beis ha'Kisei in time).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yanai says, we learn from "L'Eglos Beis On... Al Kevodo... " - we read this 'Kevedo' (its burden of excrement).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Mano'ach):</span> One may tell an idolater to put his idol in his Shin Tov (buttocks, as in Chasufai Shes (Yeshayah 20:4)).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> If bad reports are always heard about a person, one may disgrace him with Gimel and Shin (Bar Girsa Shmah Saryei, he is the son of an adulteress and he has ill repute. Alternatively, one may call him Giyufa Shatya, a crazy adulterer).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>One may praise a person about whom good reports go out. He will be blessed for doing so.</p></div>
