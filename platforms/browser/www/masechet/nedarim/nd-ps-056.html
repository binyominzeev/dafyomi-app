<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS PART OF A HOUSE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one vowed from a house, the Aliyah (second story) is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, the Aliyah is part of the house;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one vowed from the Aliyah, the house is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (Regarding Tzara'as it says) "in the house." This includes a shed (our text, Rosh. Tosfos, Ran - a colored house), and the Aliyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Meir. Chachamim say that the Aliyah is considered part of the house, so they would not need a verse to include it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> It can even be like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that "A house of the land of your inheritance" requires that it is connected to the ground, to exclude the Aliyah. "In a house" teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is the following teaching?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Chiya):</span> If one said 'I sell to you a house among my houses', he may give to him an Aliyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is only because he said 'a house among my houses.' Had he said only 'a house', he could not give him an Aliyah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It can even be like Chachamim. Aliyah does not mean a second story, rather, Me'ulah (the best) of houses.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TYPES OF BEDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one vowed from a bed, a Dargash is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, Dargash is included in 'bed'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one vowed from a Dargash, a bed is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is a Dargash?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> It is a bed spread only for good fortune, not for use.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Mishnah):</span> When giving the first consolation meal to a king (after he lost a relative), all sit on the ground, and the king sits on a Dargash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You cannot say that the only time he uses the bed is when he starts Aveilus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> We can say this! Normally, he has meat and wine only if he wants. Now, we give him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Beraisa):</span> They would not turn over the Dargash. They would leave it upright (Rosh; Rashi - they would turn it on its side).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This cannot refer to a bed for good fortune!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Not only the mourner's bed is turned. Rather, all his beds (i.e. that he owns, even if he does not sleep on them) in the house are turned!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the law of a Dargash is like the law of a bed designated for Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One need not invert a bed designated for Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> It suffices (for a mourner) to untie the loops of a Dargash, for then it falls. (The loops held the leather mat in place, suspended by the frame.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A bed for good fortune does not have loops! (It is like a regular bed, in which the mat is permanently attached.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravin):</span> It is a bed consisting of a hide that is tied to the frame.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between a bed and a Dargash?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmiyah):</span> The ropes of a bed are fastened on top of the frame. The ropes of a Dargash are fastened in the frame.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A wooden bed or crib is susceptible to Tum'ah from the time it is rubbed with skin of a fish (to smooth it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the ropes are fastened on top of the frame, there is no reason to smooth it (it is always covered)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, in both, the ropes are fastened in the frame.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In a bed, the ropes pass through holes in the frame. In a Dargash, they pass through loops attached to the frame.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yakov bar Acha):</span> If a bed has poles jutting out at the head and foot, it suffices to stand it upright.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Idi):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IF ONE VOWED FROM A CITY OR HOUSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed from a city, he may enter its Techum (the surrounding Mil (about a kilometer) in which one may walk on Shabbos). He may not enter its Ibur (the surrounding 71 Amos);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one vowed from a house, he is forbidden only from the Agaf (threshold) or further in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> How do we know that the Ibur of a city is like the city?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> "When Yehoshua was in Yericho..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot mean that he was in the city itself. The city was closed off!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he was in its Ibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he was in the Techum, and even this is considered being in the city!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> About the Techum it says "You will measure from outside the city."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed from a house, he is forbidden only from the Agaf and further in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Everything outside is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mari - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "The Kohen will leave the house (that has Tzara'as)" teaches that he goes home and closes the house (through a rope or Shali'ach)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (He goes only) "to the doorway."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he stands under the lintel and closes it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "From the house" - he must entirely leave the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> He stands next to the lintel and closes it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he went home and closed it, or closed it while under the lintel, what is the source that it is considered Musgar (quarantined)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will close the house" - in any case. (Under the lintel is considered like in the house, even if it is outside the Agaf!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Normally, under the lintel is considered outside. Here, "From the house" requires the Kohen to leave it entirely.</p>
