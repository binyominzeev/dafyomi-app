<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT WE LEARN FROM <i>ZEH HA'DAVAR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Zeh ha'Davar" - a husband annuls, but a Chacham cannot annul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should learn from a Kal v'Chomer. A husband cannot permit, but he can annul. A Chacham can permit, all the more so he can annul!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Zeh ha'Davar" - a husband can annul, but a Chacham cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>It says "Zeh ha'Davar" regarding vows, and also regarding Shechutei Chutz (slaughtering a Korban outside the Mikdash).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Shechutei Chutz applies equally to Aharon, his sons and all of Yisrael, the same applies to vows;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding vows, it mentions the heads of the tribes. This also applies to Shechutei Chutz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that Aharon, his sons and all of Yisrael also apply to vows. What does this teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> A Beis Din of three commoners can permit vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says "the heads of the tribes"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> That teaches that an expert (Chacham) can permit by himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that the heads of the tribes apply to Shechutei Chutz. What does this teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> One may permit (nullify) having made something Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The Gezeirah Shavah makes it as if 'the heads of the tribes' was written regarding Shechutei Chutz.) Beis Shamai hold that one cannot nullify Hekdesh. What do they learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Shamai do not learn the Gezeirah Shavah "Davar-Davar". They use "Zeh ha'Davar" written regarding vows to teach that a Chachamim can permit, but he cannot annul, and that a husband can annul, but he cannot permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they learn from "Zeh ha'Davar" written regarding Shechutei Chutz?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that one is liable only for Shechitah, but not for Melikah (cutting a bird's neck with the fingernail, the analog of Shechitah for bird offerings).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COMMONERS MAY PERMIT VOWS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Beis Shamai learn that three commoners may permit a vow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn like Rav Asi bar Nasan:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> "Moshe told the Mo'adim of Hash-m to Bnei Yisrael" - the Yamim Tovim are mentioned, but Shabbos is not mentioned with them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ben Azai says, the Yamim Tovim are mentioned, but the Parashah of vows was not said with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Asi bar Nasan):</span> Shabbos is mentioned with the Yamim Tovim! Parshas Nedarim is right after the Yamim Tovim! ("Moshe told..." is in the middle.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">78b----------------------------------------78b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The first Tana teaches that the Yamim Tovim depend on Kidush (declaration of Rosh Chodesh) of Beis Din, but Shabbos does not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Ben Azai teaches that the Yamim Tovim depend on (Kidush Rosh Chodesh by) expert judges, but a Beis Din of commoners can permit vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "the heads of the tribes" regarding vows!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> That teaches that an expert Chacham can permit a vow by himself.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DELAYED ANNULMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> A husband who is silent to vex his wife (so she will not know that he will annul later) can annul even 10 days later.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rava - Beraisa):</span> When do we say that if a Na'arah Me'orasah's husband died, authority to annul her vow passes to the father? This is when the husband did not hear her vow, or he heard it and was silent or annulled it, and died that day;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the husband heard it and affirmed it, or was silent and died on a later day, the father cannot annul it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case (of silence) is that he was silent to vex her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, he was silent in order to affirm it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, this is like when he affirmed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He was silent without any specific intent.</p>
