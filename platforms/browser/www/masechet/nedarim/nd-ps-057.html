<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'these Peros are forbidden to me', or 'to my mouth', he is also forbidden in Chilufeihem and Giduleihem;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'that I will eat and taste", he is permitted Chilufeihem and Giduleihem if it is a species in which the seed disintegrates;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the seed remains intact, he is forbidden even in what grows from Gidulim of the original fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven told his wife 'what you produce is forbidden to me', or 'to my mouth', also Chilufeihem and Giduleihem are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he said 'that I will eat and taste', he is permitted Chilufeihem and Giduleihem, if it is a species in which the seed dissipates;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the seed remains intact, even Gidulei Gidulim are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If Reuven told his wife 'I will not taste or wear what you make until Pesach', what she makes before Pesach is permitted after Pesach;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If he said 'what you make before Pesach, I will not taste or wear', what she makes before Pesach, is forbidden (even) after Pesach;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If he said 'You may not benefit from me until Pesach if you go to your father's house before Sukos' and she went before Pesach, she may not benefit until Pesach;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">57b----------------------------------------57b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(If she benefited before Pesach, and went) after Pesach (but before Sukos), she transgresses "He will not profane his word."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If he said 'You may not benefit from me until Sukos if you go to your father's house before Pesach' and she went before Pesach, she may not benefit until Sukos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She is permitted to go after Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DO WE FOLLOW THE BULB, OR THE ADDITIONAL GROWTH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Yishmael of Yama) Question:</span> If an onion was uprooted in Shemitah and planted in the eighth year, and the added growth is more than the bulb (that was planted), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Tosfos, Rosh):</span> The added growth is permitted, but the bulb is forbidden (like Peros Shemitah);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Is the bulb Batel in the majority of added growth, or not (the bulb remains forbidden)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ran):</span> Do we say that the added growth is permitted, and [if there is a Shi'ur for Bitul], the bulb is Batel to it?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, is this not so (and also the added growth is forbidden)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> We learn from the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina Tirsa'ah):</span> If a Terumah onion was planted and the added growth is more than the bulb, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yirmiyah):</span> Why do you learn from one teaching (of Amora'im) that opposes two teachings (in which Isur is not Batel in added growth of Heter)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Teaching #1 (R. Avahu citing R. Yochanan):</span> If a sapling (within the three years of Orlah) was grafted onto a mature tree, and there were fruits on the sapling, even if they grow 200 times larger, they are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Teaching #2 (R. Yonasan):</span> If an onion was planted in a vineyard (what grows is forbidden due to Kil'ei ha'Kerem;) even if the vineyard was later uprooted (and the added growth was 200 times the bulb), the bulb remains forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Ami):</span> We can learn from the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak citing R. Yochanan):</span> If a Litra (a measure) of onions were tithed and planted, when they grow, one tithes the entire amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that the bulb is Batel to the additional growth (and it is all considered Tevel. R. Ami held that this is R. Yochanan's true opinion, not like R. Avahu said above. Therefore, two of the three Amora'im holds that the bulb is Batel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps this is a stringency to say that the bulb is Batel.</p>
