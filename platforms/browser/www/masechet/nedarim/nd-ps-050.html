<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Akiva was Mekadesh (Rachel,) the daughter of Kalba Savu'a. When Kalba Savu'a found out, he vowed that his daughter may not benefit from his property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They got married in winter. They slept where the straw was kept. He would pick the straw from her hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> If I would have the means, I would make for you a gold ornament with a picture of Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Eliyahu appeared to them like a man begging for some straw for his wife, who had just given birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> We are more fortunate than he is. He lacks even straw!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rachel:</span> Go learn by a Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva learned for 12 years from R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua; he returned home. From outside the house, he heard a Rasha taunt his wife:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Your father was right to forbid his property to you! Your husband is not from an important family, like yours. Also, he has abandoned you. You are like a widow in his lifetime!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rachel:</span> If he would heed me, he would remain another 12 years!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva (to himself):</span> Since she permits me, I will learn more!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Akiva learned for another 12 years. He returned with 24,000 Talmidim. Everyone came to greet him, including Rachel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The Rasha:</span> How dare you go to greet him, without nice clothing?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rachel:</span> "A Tzadik knows the soul of his animal." (He knows how I toiled for him, and that I don't have better clothing.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>She came to see him; the Talmidim didn't let her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Allow her! My learning and yours belongs (is due) to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Kalba Savu'a asked him to permit his vow. R. Akiva did so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Akiva became wealthy from six sources.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From Kalba Savu'a.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>From a wooden image of a ram (filled with coins) that is placed on ships.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Once, the crew forgot it on the shore, and R. Akiva found it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>From the treasure chest of a ship.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Akiva once gave four Zuz to sailors and asked them to buy something for him. All they found was a chest on the shore; they brought it to him. They said 'wait until we get more for you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Akiva found that it was full of money. Once, a ship sank, and all the money aboard was in the chest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>From a wealthy woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(R. Akiva once borrowed money from her. She said that Hash-m and the sea should be guarantors. He was unable to repay on time. She asked Hash-m to pay; He caused her to receive even more money via the sea. She gave the excess to R. Akiva.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">50b----------------------------------------50b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Turnusrufus' wife (she later converted and married R. Akiva, and gave him great wealth).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Ketia bar Shalom (he gave half his wealth to R Akiva).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Gamda gave four Zuz to sailors and asked them to buy something for him. They didn't find anything; they bought a monkey for him. The monkey fled and entered a hole; they found it sitting on jewels. The sailors generously gave them all to Rav Gamda.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TORAH AND BEAUTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Keisar's daughter asked R. Yehoshua:</span> Why is such glorious Torah in such an ugly Kli (yourself)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Learn from your father's house. What do they put their wine in?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Keisar's daughter:</span> They put it in earthenware vessels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Everyone does so! You should put your wine in silver and gold Kelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She did so; the wine spoiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Also Torah (spoils if it is in beautiful Kelim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Keisar's daughter:</span> But there are beautiful Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> If they would be ugly, they would learn more.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>A woman came before Rav Yehudah for judgment. The outcome was against her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The woman:</span> Would your Rebbi, Shmuel, have judged thusly?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Did you know him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The woman:</span> Yes. He was short, had a large stomach, was dark (freckled), and had big teeth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Did you come to disgrace him?! You are excommunicated!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>She died.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>COOKED DISHES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (One who vowed not to eat cooked dishes) may eat a Tormita egg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> One puts an egg 1000 times in hot water, and 1000 times in cold water, until it is small enough to be swallowed whole.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a sick person eats it, the sickness will cling to the egg. When the egg leaves his system, a doctor can look at it and will know how to cure him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A slave who knows how to make this egg is worth 1000 Dinars!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Shmuel tested himself so much in this fashion that he grew weak. His family pulled out their hair from grief.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (A worker may eat from the species he works with.) One working with Klufsin may not eat Benos Shu'ach (these are different species of figs), or vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Klufsin is the species from which we make Lifdi (a fig dish).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Reuven hired Shimon to teach Reuven's slave 1000 types of Lifdi. He taught him only 800. Reuven summoned Shimon for judgment in front of Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Our fathers said "We have forgotten goodness." We have not even seen goodness (we do not know 1000 types).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>REBBI'S BANQUET</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rebbi was marrying off his son R. Shimon. (The text of Ein Yakov - Bar Kapara wrote a sign saying that) Rebbi spent 240 million Dinars for the Nisu'in, and did not invite Bar Kapara (lest Bar Kapara make him laugh).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Bar Kapara (to Rebbi):</span> If Hash-m gives such wealth to those who transgress His will (you), how much more will He give to those who do His will!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi invited him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Bar Kapara:</span> If Hash-m gives in this world so much to those who do His will (you), how much more will He give in the world to come!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(Rebbi's afflictions used to atone for the world.) Any day that Rebbi would laugh, punishments would come to the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi (to Bar Kapara):</span> Do not make me laugh, and I will give you 40 measures of wheat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Bar Kapara:</span> Watch. I will get as much as I want.</p>
