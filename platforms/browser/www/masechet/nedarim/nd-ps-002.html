<p class="dedicationbox"><br>12TH CYCLE DEDICATION<br>NEDARIM 2-5 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the eighth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>KINUYIM AND YADOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Every Kinuy (substitute name) for each of the following works like saying the actual word: a Neder (vow), Cherem (making something somewhat or totally like Hekdesh; this will be explained), Shevu'ah (oath), or Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one said any of the following to Levi, he may not benefit from Levi - 'I am Mudar (forbidden by a vow) from you', 'I am separated from you', 'I am distanced from you', 'that I will eat Lecha (from you)', or 'that I will taste Lecha (from you)'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva was inclined to be stringent about one who said 'I am Menudeh to you' (this will be explained).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE CONTENTS AND ORDER OF THE <i>MISHNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The first Mishnah of Nazir similarly discusses Kinuyim of Nezirus.) Why does our Mishnah teach about all kinds of Kinuyim, whereas the Mishnah in Nazir does not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A verse discusses Nedarim and Shevuos together, so our Mishnah taught both of these. Once it taught two, it taught all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Mishnah should teach Shevuos right after Nedarim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches Cherem after Neder because both of them forbid (use or benefit from) an object to a person. A Shevu'ah forbids a person to (use or benefit from) an object.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> The Mishnah begins with Kinuyim (it teaches that they work). Why does it explain Yados (abridged vows) first?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Did the Tana forget to teach Yados (that they work, i.e. that if one said a Yad, it is as if he said the full Neder)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Question #2):</span> (Indeed, the Tana taught both.) The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Every Kinuy for a Neder is like saying 'Neder'. Every Yad for a Neder is like saying the full Neder.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana should illustrate Kinuyim first! (Why did he illustrate Yados now, and wait until the third Mishnah (10a) to illustrate Kinuyim?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He first explains the matter taught last, like we find elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What may be used to light (Neros Shabbos), and what is forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may not use the following...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> In what may one do Hatmanah (wrap things to keep them hot on Shabbos), and in what is it forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hatmanah is forbidden in the following...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What may a woman wear outside (on Shabbos), and what is forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She may not go out with...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana does not always begin to explain the last matter taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Some relatives inherit from and bequeath to each other. In some cases, one relative inherits the other, but does not bequeath to the other...</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The following inherit from and bequeath to each other...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Some women are permitted to their husbands and forbidden to their Yevamim. Some are forbidden to their husbands and permitted to their Yevamim...</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The following are permitted to their husbands and forbidden to their Yevamim...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Some Menachos require oil and Levonah. Some require oil but not Levonah...</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The following require oil and Levonah...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Some Menachos require Hagashah (bringing them to the southwest corner of the Mizbe'ach), but not Tenufah (waving). Some require Tenufah, but not Hagashah...</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The following require Hagashah...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Some boys are considered a Bechor (firstborn) regarding inheritance (to get a double portion), but not regarding (the Mitzvah to be redeemed by giving five Shekalim to) a Kohen. Some are a Bechor regarding a Kohen, but not for inheritance...</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The following are Bechoros only for inheritance...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> In each of these Mishnayos there are many (four) matters, therefore it first discusses the first one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Sometimes the Tana does not explain the last matter first, even when there are only two!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> With what may animals go out with on Shabbos, and what is forbidden?</p>
