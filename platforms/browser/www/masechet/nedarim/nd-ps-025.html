<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OATHS OF EXAGGERATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> A person swears according to our Da'as (understanding). We do not refer to ants the way we refer to people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that a person does not swear according to his own Da'as?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When Beis Din makes someone swear, we tell him 'we do not impose this oath based on a condition in your heart. Rather, it is according to the Da'as of Hash-m and Beis Din.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we exclude by saying this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He cannot use 'coins' as a nickname for wood chips (and swear that he gave the coins to his creditor).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We needed to say that he swears based on our Da'as. This shows that a person normally swears on his own Da'as!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> No, we exclude Rava's case of the reed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven claimed that he paid his debt to Shimon; Rava told him to swear. Reuven had hidden coins in a reed, and was using it for a cane. Before swearing, he asked Shimon to take the reed. Reuven held a Sefer Torah and swore that he paid Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Upon hearing the oath, Shimon broke the reed in anger. The coins fell out, and it was seen that the oath was true.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The following shows that a person swears based on his own Da'as!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When Moshe Rabeinu made Yisrael swear at Arvos Mo'av, he told them that they are not swearing on their Da'as, rather on Moshe's and Hash-m's Da'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Moshe needed to say this, lest they nickname idolatry 'Elokah' (and have this in mind when swearing to serve Elokim), because a person swears based on his own Da'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Rejection):</span> No, idolatry really is called 'Elokah' - "against all Elokei Mitzrayim..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Moshe make them swear to keep Mitzvos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This could be interpreted to mean (only) the Mitzvos of appointing a king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Moshe make them swear to keep all the Mitzvos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This could be interpreted to mean the Mitzvah of Tzitzis, which measures up to all the Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Moshe make them swear to keep Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This could be interpreted to mean only one Torah (written or oral).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Moshe make them swear to keep Toros?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This could be interpreted to mean only Toros (the laws) of kinds of Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Moshe make them swear to keep Toros and Mitzvos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This could be interpreted to mean only Toros of Korbanos and the Mitzvos of appointing a king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Moshe make them swear to keep the entire Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This could be interpreted to mean (observing the Isurim of) idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Idolatry is severe. Anyone who denies idolatry is like one who confirms the entire Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Moshe make them swear to keep the Isurim of idolatry and the entire Torah; or, to keep 613 Mitzvos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was easier to make them swear based on the Da'as of Moshe and Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OATHS OF EXAGGERATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If I did not see a snake like a beam of an olive-press...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't this be true?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the days of Shvor Malka, there was a snake that ate 13 storehouses of straw!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> He means, a snake that is Taruf (Ran - creviced; Rosh - wide, not round) like a beam of an olive press.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> All snakes are like this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He refers to its back, which is never Taruf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah should say '...if I did not see a snake whose back was Taruf!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches, in passing, that the back of a beam of an olive press should be Taruf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is relevant to one who sells a beam of an olive press. Its back must be Taruf.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MISTAKEN VOWS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Nedrei Shegagos (mistaken vows): 'If I ate or drank (I forbid...)', and later he remembered that he had done so;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>'If I will eat or drink (I forbid...)', and later he forgot that he said this and ate or drank;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>'I forbid my wife to benefit from me, for she stole my wallet or hit my son', and later he learned that she did not;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Beis Shamai say, if a man saw people eating his figs, and said 'the figs are forbidden to them like a Korban'; and he found that his father and brothers were among the people, only his father and brothers are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Beis Hillel say, the vow is totally void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Just like mistaken vows are permitted, also mistaken oaths.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a case of a mistaken oath?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like the case of Rav Kahana and Rav Asi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argued about what Rav had said. Each swore that he was right.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Each believed that he swore truthfully.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he saw people eating...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We are Pose'ach with Shabbos and Yom Tov (the person overlooked that his vow will include these days).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At first, Chachamim said that those days are permitted and other days are forbidden. Later, R. Akiva taught that a vow that was partially permitted is totally permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If he says 'had I known that father was among them, I would have said 'they are all forbidden except for father'', Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that are all forbidden except for his father;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue when he says 'had I known that father was among them, I would have said that Ploni and Almoni are forbidden, and father is permitted'. (Beis Hillel permit everyone, for he would not have forbidden the others with the same expression (they or everyone, rather, he would have specified them by name). This is like R. Akiva.)</p>
