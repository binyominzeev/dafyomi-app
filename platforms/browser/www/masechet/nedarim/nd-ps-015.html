<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CONCERN LEST ONE TRANSGRESS A CONDITIONAL VOW (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Yehudah - Mishnah):</span> If one said "Konam that I sleep, speak, walk..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he literally said "that I sleep", this does not take effect, for sleep is intangible!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The stringency of Shevuos is that they can take effect on tangible and intangible matters, but Nedarim do not (they apply only to tangible matters).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He said "Konam my eyes to sleep."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If he did not limit the duration of his vow (it is impossible to fulfill, so) it does not take effect at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one swore not to sleep for three days, we lash him (for a vain oath), and he may sleep immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He said "Konam my eyes to sleep tomorrow if I will sleep today.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We said that one is careful about transgressing the vow itself (all agree that he may sleep today)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, he said "Konam my eyes to sleep today if I will sleep tomorrow."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he may not sleep today, why does Bal Yachel apply tomorrow?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that he may sleep today. This refutes Rav Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah means that if he (transgressed and) slept today, Bal Yachel applies tomorrow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (and Answer #4 to Question a:1 - Ravina):</span> Really, he literally said "that I sleep." Mid'Rabanan, Bal Yachel applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Bal Yachel ever apply mid'Rabanan?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Lo Yachel Devaro" - if people consider something to be forbidden, and really it is permitted, you may not be lenient about it to abolish the custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Yehudah - Mishnah):</span> If one told his wife 'You may not benefit from me until Pesach if you go to your father's house before Sukos' and she went before Pesach, she may not benefit until Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> She may not benefit until Pesach only if she went before Pesach. If not, she may benefit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> If she went before Pesach, she may not benefit until Pesach, and if she does she is lashed. If she did not go before Pesach, there is a mere Isur (without lashes for benefit until Pesach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> (If she went) after Pesach (but before Sukos), she transgresses "Lo Yachel Devaro."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she may not benefit before, why does Bal Yachel apply later?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that she may benefit before. This refutes Rav Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that, if she (transgressed and) benefited before Pesach, after Pesach "Lo Yachel Devaro" applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Yehudah - Mishnah):</span> If a man told his wife "you may not benefit from me until Sukos if you go to your father's house before Pesach", if she went before Pesach, she may not benefit until Sukos. She may go after Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> She may not benefit only if she went before Pesach. If not, she may benefit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Even if she did not go before Pesach, she is forbidden. If she went, she is lashed for benefit (before Sukos). If she did not go before Pesach, there is a mere Isur (until Pesach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Yehudah - Beraisa):</span> If one said 'this loaf is forbidden to me today if I will go to the place 'Ploni' tomorrow':</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he ate it, he is forbidden to go there tomorrow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that he may eat it (we are not concerned lest he transgress the Tnai)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It doesn't say that he may eat it. It says "if he ate it..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If he went, he transgresses Bal Yachel (if he ate it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> According to Rav Yehudah, (since he may not eat the first day,) the Beraisa should have taught that he may go!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said that he may go. It said "if he went" for parallel structure with the Reisha, which must say "if he ate", for it cannot say "he may eat."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A VOW TO FORBID <i>BI'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said "Konam that I have Bi'ah with you", Bal Yachel applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah obligates him to have Bi'ah with her (so he cannot uproot this through a Neder) - "She'erah Kesusah v'Onasah Lo Yigra"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he said 'pleasure of Bi'ah with you is forbidden to me.' He can forbid to himself, like Rav Kahana taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If a woman told her husband 'pleasure of Bi'ah with me is forbidden to you', he can force her to have Bi'ah, for she is obligated;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she said 'pleasure of Bi'ah with you is forbidden to me', Bi'ah is forbidden, for one may not 'feed' to Ploni a food (or anything) forbidden to Ploni.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FORBIDDING EATING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one swore not to sleep, speak, or walk, he is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said "Korban, I will not eat from you," "Ha Korban, what I eat from you," or "l'Korban (this is the text of most Rishonim), I will not eat from you," he is permitted. (In the former cases, he swore in the life of a Korban, which is void, or he forbade what he will not eat. The Gemara will explain l'Korban.)</p>
