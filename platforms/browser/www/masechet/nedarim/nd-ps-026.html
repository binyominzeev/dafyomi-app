<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A MISTAKEN VOW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that if he says 'had I known that father was among them, I would have said 'Ploni and Almoni are forbidden, and father is permitted'', they are all permitted. (Since he would have used a different expression to forbid the others, all permit totally.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue when he says 'Had I known that father was among them, I would have said 'they are all forbidden except for father'';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(R. Meir and R. Yosi argue about a self-contradictory statement, e.g. 'this animal is Temuras (in place of) a Korban Olah (it is) Temuras Shelamim.') Beis Shamai hold like R. Meir, who says that that his first words are primary. (Therefore, we do not say that the latter words nullify his first words;)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Beis Hillel hold like R. Yosi, that his last words are primary. (This is like a partially permitted Neder, which is totally permitted.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A PARTIALLY PERMITTED VOW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa against Rava - Mishnah):</span> In what case did R. Akiva say that a vow that was partially permitted is entirely permitted? If one said 'Konam, none of you may benefit from me', and he became permitted to one of them, he is permitted to all of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'may not benefit from me - not this one, nor this...', and the first becomes permitted, all are permitted. If the last becomes permitted, the others remain forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is not difficult for Rabah. He establishes the Reisha (if he becomes permitted to one of them, he is permitted to all of them) when he retracted and said 'had I known, I would have said 'they are forbidden to this one and this one'';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Seifa is when he retracted and said 'Had I known, I would have said 'they are forbidden to all of you, except for...''</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Also Rava can explain the Reisha. He retracted and said 'had I known, I would have said 'they are forbidden to all of you, except for...''</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question against Rava):</span> In the Seifa, when he retracted he said 'Had I known, I would have said 'they are forbidden to this one and to this one...'' Why is this only R. Akiva's opinion?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to Rava, all agree in this case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to Rabah, how can we establish the Seifa like R. Akiva?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'to all of you', it is inappropriate to discuss permitting the first or last!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for Rabah and Rava):</span> In the Reisha, he said 'to all of you.' In the Seifa, he made each dependent on the previous - 'they are forbidden to Shimon. Levi is (forbidden) like Shimon; Yehudah is like Levi...'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If the middle one was permitted, the later ones are also permitted, but the earlier ones are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah, against Rava - Mishnah):</span> If one said 'onions are forbidden to me, for they harm the heart', and then he heard that onions of Kufri are good for the heart, he is permitted to eat all onions;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Such a case occurred, and R. Meir permitted all onions to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He said 'had I known that that onions of Kufri are good for the heart, I would have said 'all onions are forbidden to me, but Kufri are permitted''!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. He said 'had I known that that onions of Kufri are good for the heart, I would have said 'these onions and these onions are forbidden to me, but Kufri are permitted.''</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir holds like R. Akiva and like Chachamim. (Since he would have used a different expression to forbid the other onions, even Chachamim permit totally.)</p>
