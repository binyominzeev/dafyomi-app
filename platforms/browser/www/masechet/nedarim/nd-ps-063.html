<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>UNTIL THE RAINS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The times of the first, middle and last rains are the third, seventh and 17th (of Cheshvan), respectively;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, the times are the seventh,17th and 23rd;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, they are the 17th, 23rd and Rosh Chodesh Kislev.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is like R. Yosi's opinion that individuals do not fast for rain until Rosh Chodesh Kislev.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Granted, we must teach the time of the first rains, for this is when we request rain in prayer. The time of the third rains is when individuals start fasting.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must we know the time of the middle rains?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> This is needed for one who vowed (until the rain).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like which of the three opinions above is the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Rain that fell seven consecutive days constitutes the first and second rains.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Yosi. (This culminates Question (a). Tosfos - R. Zeira said that all agree that 'until the rain' means until the first rain, but here, R. Shimon ben Gamliel is concerned for the time of the second rains (which we said is needed for one who vowed)! Ran - in the Beraisa, R. Shimon ben Gamliel told Chachamim that they should consider the second rains to be after seven straight days of rain. R. Zeira said that all agree that when he says 'until the rain', that it means the normal time, whether or not the rain came!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the Beraisa, he vowed 'until the rains'.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE EXTRA MONTH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'wine is forbidden to me for a year', and the year was made a leap year, he is forbidden also in the added month;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'until Rosh Chodesh Adar', he is forbidden until Rosh Chodesh of the first Adar;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he said 'until the end of Adar', he is forbidden until the end of the first Adar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> When one does not specify, 'Adar' means the first Adar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> When writing a document in Adar Rishon, one writes the date 'Adar Rishon'. In Adar Sheni, one writes just 'Adar';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, in Adar Rishon, one writes 'Adar'. In Adar Sheni, one writes 'Adar Sheni'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> Our Mishnah is even like R. Meir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When one knows that it will be a leap year, 'Adar' refers to Adar Sheni. Before one knows that it will be a leap year, 'Adar' refers to Adar Rishon.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one said 'until Rosh Chodesh Adar', this is until Rosh Chodesh Adar Rishon. If it is a leap year, it is until Rosh Chodesh Adar Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> (Surely, also the Reisha discusses a leap year! Rather,) in the Reisha he did not know that it is a leap year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like Abaye. In the Seifa he knew that it is a leap year, so 'Adar' means Adar Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE INTENTION OF ONE WHO VOWED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If one said 'wine is forbidden to me until it will be Pesach', he intended only until the night of Pesach, the time when people drink wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one said 'meat is forbidden to me until it will be the fast', he is forbidden only until (but not including the meal before) the night of Yom Kipur, for he intended only until the time when people eat meat;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi bar R. Yehudah says, if one said 'garlic is forbidden to me until it will be Shabbos', he is forbidden only until (but not including) Shabbos night, for he intended only until the time when people eat garlic.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If Reuven told Shimon 'you may not benefit from me if you do not take for your children (from me) a Kor of wheat and two barrels of wine', Shimon can permit this vow without asking a Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He says, 'you vowed only for my honor. It is my honor that I not take!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Similarly, if Reuven told Shimon 'you may not benefit from me if you do not give to my son a Kor of wheat and two barrels of wine', R. Meir says, the vow stands until he gives;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Chachamim say, Reuven can permit this vow without asking a Chacham. He says, 'it is as if I received.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>In the following cases, (other) benefit is permitted, for the intent was only to forbid Bi'ah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven was being pressured to marry his sister's daughter; he was refusing. He vowed that his niece may never benefit from him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reuven divorced his wife, and vowed that she may never benefit from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If Shimon was insisting that Reuven eat by him, and Reuven was refusing and said 'it is forbidden for me to enter your house or to drink a drop of a cold drink from you', he may enter his house and drink a cold drink;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He intended only to forbid a proper meal.</p>
