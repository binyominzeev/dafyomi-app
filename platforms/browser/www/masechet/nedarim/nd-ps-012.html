<p class="dedicationbox"><br>12TH CYCLE DEDICATION<br>NEDARIM 12-14 - Two weeks of Dafyomi study material have been dedicated by Ms. Estanne Abraham-Fawer to honor the eighth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IN WHAT IS ONE <i>MATFIS</i>? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava - Mishnah):</span> (If one said...) 'Nosar', or 'Pigul' (he forbids.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>These are after Zerikah, and it is still binding. This shows that one is Matfis in the initial Isur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Nasan):</span> Perhaps the Mishnah discusses Nosar of an Olah (it is always forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If so, the Mishnah should have discussed meat of an Olah (it was forbidden even before it was Nosar)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> The Mishnah teaches a bigger Chidush:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Not only Hatfasah in an Olah is forbidden, for surely he is Matfis in Davar ha'Nadur (something that became forbidden through a vow. Only such Hatfasah forbids);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rather, it teaches about Nosar and Pigul of an Olah. One might have thought that he is Matfis in the Isur of Nosar or Pigul, i.e. Hatfasah in Davar ha'Asur (something forbidden, but not due to a vow), which does not forbid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Huna, or Answer #2 - Beraisa):</span> What is Isar mentioned in the Torah (Le'esor Isar Al Nafsho - Bamidbar 30:3)? One said 'I will not eat meat or drink wine like the day my father or Rebbi died, or the day Gedalyah ben Achikam was killed, or the day I saw Yerushalayim in ruin.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The case is, he (once) vowed not to eat meat or drink wine on that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He said 'I am forbidden today like (e.g.) the first Sunday of Nisan.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Even though there are many permitted Sundays, we assume that he is Matfis in the initial Isur (the day he vowed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (or Rejection):</span> No, Shmuel means that he had already taken a Neder not to eat meat... on any such day (so it is impossible to say that he was Matfis in Heter).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HATFASAH IN TRUMAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> If one said "this is like Chalah (separated from dough and given to sons) of Aharon and his Terumah (from grain, wine and oil)", it is permitted (because these are not totally forbidden. Kohanim may eat them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he forbade 'like Terumas Lachmei Todah (one loaf of each of the four kinds of bread brought with a Korban Todah; it is given to a Kohen)", it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is separated after Zerikah (of the Todah), and then the loaves are permitted. (This shows that he is Matfis in the initial Isur before Zerikah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Rather, if he forbade 'like Terumas ha'Lishkah (Shekalim used to buy Korbanos Tzibur)', it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If when he said 'like Terumas Lachmei Todah', it is permitted, the Mishnah should have taught this, and all the more (we would know) "like Terumaso")!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Terumas Lachmei Todah is included in his Terumah (Rosh's text).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Terumas Lachmei Todah could be before Zerikah, even at the time of kneading (and then the vow would forbid. den, and therefore the case was not mentioned);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tuvi bar Kisna citing Shmuel):</span> If one baked four loaves for Lachmei Todah, he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah explicitly requires "forty"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Terumah must be given to a Kohen!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he gives one loaf to exempt the rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> "Echad mi'Kol Korban" - one may not separate from one type to exempt another.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he gives a piece from each loaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> "Echad" - (he must separate a full loaf,) he may not take a piece.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Terumah is separated at the time of kneading, one dough from each type. (Shmuel teaches that the remaining nine of each type may be joined and baked together.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HATFASAH IN A BECHOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about this (whether one is Matfis in the initial Isur or in the current Heter):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yakov):</span> If someone forbade something "like a Bechor," it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is before Zerikah, R. Yehudah would not permit!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it is after Zerikah, R. Yakov would not forbid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that there is a piece of Chulin next to a piece of Bechor after Zerikah, and he said "this is like this", and the Tana'im argue about this!</p>
