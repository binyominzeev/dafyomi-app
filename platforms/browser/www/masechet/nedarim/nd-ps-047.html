<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who says to his friend...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Avimi):</span> If Reuven said to Shimon 'it is forbidden for you to enter this house', and Reuven died or sold it, is Shimon permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Can a person forbid something so that it remains forbidden even after it does not belong to him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Mishna):</span> If Reuven told his son 'you may not benefit from me', when Reuven dies, his son inherits him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said '(you may not benefit from me) during my life and after my death', when Reuven dies, his son does not inherit him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that a person can forbid something for even after it does not belong to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'these Peros are forbidden to me', he may not benefit from what they are exchanged for or from what grows from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If one said 'this produce is forbidden to Ploni', may Ploni benefit from what it is exchanged for?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps one can forbid to himself something that is not yet in the world, because he can forbid to himself someone else's property;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But since one cannot forbid his friend's property to his friend, he cannot forbid to his friend something that is not yet in the world!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps what they are exchanged for is forbidden, just like what grows from them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha bar Minyomi - Beraisa):</span> If a man told his wife 'you may not benefit from me', she may borrow, and the creditors collect from the husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is as if the money she borrowed was exchanged for what her husband repaid, and she is allowed to benefit. This settles the question!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Perhaps it is forbidden only l'Chatchilah to exchange what is forbidden, but b'Di'eved, it is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> If one was Mekadesh a woman by giving her Orlah (fruits within the first three years of a tree, which are forbidden), she is not Mekudeshes. If he sold the Orlah and was Mekadesh her with the money, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Here also, perhaps it is forbidden l'Chatchilah to exchange Isur, but b'Di'eved it is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A VOW OF <i>CHEREM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'I am Cherem to you', Shimon may not benefit from Reuven;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven said 'you are Cherem to me', Reuven is Mudar Hana'ah from Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he said 'I am Cherem to you, and you to me', neither may benefit from the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Both may benefit from matters of the exiles who returned from Bavel, but not from matters of the city.</p>
