<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO VOWED NOT TO EAT FROM HIS FRIEND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shimon may not lend to Levi (a sifter...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't he lend to these things? The vow forbids only eating from him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> The case is, Levi said '<i>benefit from</i> your food is forbidden to me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> (This does not explain why he cannot lend Kelim.) This connotes that Levi cannot get any benefit from Shimon's food, e.g. to use chewed wheat to cure a wound on his foot! (Tosfos - if Shimon chewed Levi's wheat, even this is forbidden.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The case is, he said 'benefit (from you) that leads to (your - this is not in the text of the Rishonim) food is forbidden to me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> A sack or donkey to bring produce, or even a basket, is considered benefit that leads to food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Questions (Rav Papa):</span> May he lend to him a horse to ride on or a ring to wear? May Levi walk through Shimon's property? (These will help Levi to get to food, or to look distinguished and get a nicer portion.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> He may lend to him a cloak and rings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Levi will not get a better portion because he is wearing them, obviously, Shimon may lend them to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Levi will get a better portion, and still, Shimon may lend them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Really, Levi will not get a better portion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Reisha taught Kelim that he may not lend to him, so the Seifa teaches Kelim that he may lend to him, even though it is obvious.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may not lend to him any Kli not used for food, in a place where such Kelim are rented.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The Kelim listed in the Reisha may not be lent even where they are not rented (but are lent for free). Which Tana forbids this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> It is R. Eliezer (who forbids Vitur).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH BENEFITS ARE PERMITTED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven is Mudar Hana'ah from Shimon, Shimon may give the half-Shekel (that every person must give to Hekdesh each year for Korbanos) on behalf of Reuven, he may pay Reuven's debt, and he may return Reuven's Aveidah (something he lost);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In a place where people pay for returning Aveidos (compensation for wages that the finder lost while occupied with the Aveidah), the money goes to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> These benefits must be considered like mere prevention of damage. This is why they are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana holds like this?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Hoshaya):</span> It is Chanan (brought below);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah can even be like Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah permits paying a debt that was given on condition that the lender may not press the borrower for payment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which teaching of Chanan does Rav Hoshaya refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah - Chanan):</span> If Yehudah went overseas and Levi fed Yehudah's wife, he is not reimbursed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The sons of Kohanim Gedolim and R. Dosa say that Levi swears how much he gave to her, and he is reimbursed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> Chanan is correct. Levi threw away his money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rava did not answer like Rav Hoshaya, for he prefers to establish the Mishnah like everyone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Hoshaya did not answer like Rava. We would decree to forbid paying such a debt, lest he pay a normal debt.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>RETURNING AN <i>AVEIDAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may return his Aveidah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Ami or R. Asi):</span> Shimon may return to Reuven (the Mudar). Shimon does not give to him anything. He merely returns Reuven's property to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven may not return Shimon's Aveidah, for Reuven would save money due to Shimon, like Rav Yosef taught. (One who is engaged in returning or caring for an Aveidah is engaged in a Mitzvah, therefore he is exempt from giving Tzedakah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Ami and R. Asi):</span> Even Reuven may return to Shimon. It is rare that one saves money through Rav Yosef's law.</p>
