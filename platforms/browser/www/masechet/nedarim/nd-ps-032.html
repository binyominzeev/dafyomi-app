<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE GREATNESS OF CIRCUMCISION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is because he involved himself in arranging lodging for the night before circumcising - "On the way, at the lodging place..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, Hash-m did not seek to kill Moshe, rather the baby - "You are a Chasan of blood to me."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The baby is called a Chasan (for circumcision is his first Mitzvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah bar Bizna):</span> When Moshe slackened from circumcising his son, the damaging angels Af and Cheimah swallowed his entire body, except for his legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Immediately, Tziporah circumcised her son with a rock, and the angels left Moshe alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>At that point, Moshe sought to kill them - "Desist from Af and abandon Cheimah".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Some say that he killed Cheimah - "I do not have Cheimah".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But (at a later time) Moshe said "I was afraid of Af and Cheimah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There were two angels called Cheimah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He was afraid of the legions of Cheimah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Circumcision is great. No one engaged in Mitzvos as Avraham, yet he was called complete only when he circumcised himself - "Walk in front of me and be perfect... I will put Berisi between Me and you".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, it is great, for it is equal to all the Mitzvos of the Torah - "Based to these matters (I made a Bris with you)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, it is great, for if not for it, Shamayim and earth would not last - "If not for Berisi day and night".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This opposes R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Torah is great. If not for it, Shamayim and earth would not last - "If not for Berisi day and night, I would not have made Shamayim and earth".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> When Hash-m told Avraham "Walk in front of Me and be perfect", Avraham was afraid - 'Perhaps there is something detestable about me'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Hash-m said "I will put Berisi between us" he was assuaged.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ACTING IN PURITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>"He (Hash-m) took him (Avraham) outside" - Avraham had told Hash-m 'I see in my Mazal that I will not have a son".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m - Leave your astrology. There is no Mazal for Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Anyone who acts purely with Hash-m, Hash-m acts purely with him - "With a Chasid you bestow Chesed; with a Tahor man you are Tahor".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Hoshaya):</span> We learn, whoever purifies his character will rise to greatness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says, "Walk in front of me and be perfect", and then "You will be the father of a multitude of nations".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> Anyone who engages in Nichush (acts according to omens) will be affected by them - "Lo (to him) there is Nichush".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> "Lo" is written with an Aleph. It means 'No'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he will be affected by them because Hash-m treats people according to their actions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Ahavah, R. Zeira's son):</span> Anyone who does not do Nichush merits a greater closeness to Hash-m than the ministering angels - "Yisrael do not do Nichush; there is no sorcery in Yisrael (and the angels will ask Yisrael about Hash-m's actions)".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AVRAHAM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Avahu):</span> Why was Avraham punished that his children should be enslaved for 210 years in Mitzrayim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu):</span> It is because he used Chachamim to fight in war - "He armed his trained ones, those born in his house".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> It is because he questioned Hash-m's ways too much - "With what will I know that I will inherit (Eretz Yisrael)?"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> "Give me the people, and keep the spoils" - Avraham returned captives to the king of Sodom, instead of keeping them to bring them to serve Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "He armed his trained ones, those born in his house" - he loaded them with Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He loaded them with gold (to entice them to fight).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Ami bar Aba):</span> "Three hundred and 18" - Avraham's slave Eliezer was equal to all of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Really, only Eliezer aided Avraham in the war;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah says 318, for this is the Gematriya (numerical value) of 'Eliezer'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami bar Aba):</span> Avraham was three years old when he recognized Hash-m - "Eikev (because) you listened to my voice";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Gematriya of Eikev is 172. (Avraham served Hash-m the last 172 of his 175 years.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami bar Aba):</span> The numerical value of 'ha'Satan' (the accuser) is 364. (He prosecutes all days of the year except for one - Yom Kipur.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami bar Aba):</span> Hash-m changed Avram's name to Avraham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At first, Hash-m gave Avram dominion over 243 of his limbs (the Gematriya of Avram). Later, Hash-m gave him control over the last five as well - the eyes, ears and male organ.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami bar Aba):</span> "A small city and few men..." - the city is the human body; the few men are the limbs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"A great king came and surrounded the city" - this is the Yetzer Ra (evil inclination);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"He built around it fortresses" - these are sins;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"There was in the city a poor Chacham" - this is the Yetzer Tov;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"He saved the city with his wisdom" - this is repentance and good deeds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"No one remembered the poor Chacham" - when the Yetzer Ra seduces, no one remembers the Yetzer Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>"Wisdom will strengthen a Chacham more than 10 officers" - the wisdom referred to is repentance and good deeds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The 10 officers are the eyes, ears, hands, feet, male organ, and mouth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zecharyah):</span> (Initially) Hash-m wanted that Kohanim should descend from Shem - "He was a Kohen to Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m decreed that Kehunah would come from Avraham because Shem blessed Avraham before Hash-m - "blessed is Avraham... and blessed is Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Avraham - One does not bless the slave before the master!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Immediately, Hash-m decreed that Kehunah would come from Avraham - "The word of Hash-m to (Avraham)... you are a Kohen forever on the words of Malki Tzedek (Shem)" - because of his words.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"He (Shem) was a Kohen to Hash-m", but his seed was not.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK EIN BEIN HA'MUDAR</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE WHO IS <i>MUDAR</i> <i>HANA'AH</i> FROM HIS FRIEND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (If Reuven vowed not to benefit from Shimon, or Shimon vowed 'Reuven may not benefit from me', in either case Reuven is Mudar Hana'ah from Shimon.) If Reuven is Mudar Hana'ah from Shimon, and Levi is Mudar food from Shimon, the only difference between them is that Reuven may not walk through Shimon's property or borrow Kelim not used for food, but Levi may;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Shimon may not lend to Levi a sifter, grinder or oven. He may lend to him cloaks and rings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah (who forbids walking on property)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> It is R. Eliezer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Even Vitur (small benefits that people normally do for free, e.g. a seller who gives a bit extra) may not be done for one who is Mudar Hana'ah.</p>
