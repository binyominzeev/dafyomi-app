<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PERMISSION THROUGH REGRET</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The grandson of the elder R. Yanai came before the elder R. Yanai to permit a vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yanai - Had you known that because of your vow, the Heavenly Beis Din will open your case and scrutinize your deeds, would you have vowed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>His grandson - No.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yanai permitted the vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> R. Yanai learned that a vow causes one's deeds to be scrutinized from "after vows, to investigate".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though R. Yanai used this to be Pose'ach (suggest that a vow was mistaken, which is grounds to permit it), we do not use it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Also, we are not Pose'ach with the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Gamliel):</span> "One can damage like a sword through his utterance, but the words of Chachamim heal" - anyone who vows should be pierced by a sword, but Chachamim can cure him (by permitting the vow).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Also, we are not Pose'ach with the following teaching:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Nasan):</span> One who vows is like one who builds a private Mizbe'ach (when they are forbidden); one who fulfills the vow (i.e. and does not permit it) is like one who offers a Korban on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> We are Pose'ach with the first half of the teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We may also use the second half.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We may not use the second half.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Tivyomi):</span> We are not Pose'ach with the second half of the teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We may use the first half.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We may not use the first half.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Halachah is, we may not use either half.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Also, we are not Pose'ach with Shmuel's teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Even though one fulfills the vow, he is called wicked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> This is learned from "When you will refrain from vowing, there will not be sin in you".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "cease-cease". It says "when you will cease from vowing" and "there, the wicked ceased from rage."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> A Mishnah teaches that one who vows is called wicked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed 'like vows of proper people', this is not a vow. If he said 'like vows of Resha'im', this is a vow, be it a vow of Nezirus, to bring a Korban, or an oath.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ANGER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> All types of Gehinom rule over one who gets angry - "Remove anger from your heart, and purge evil from your flesh."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Evil" refers to Gehinom - "Hash-m did everything for his praise; also a Rasha, on his evil day (will be a praise of Hash-m)".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, Tachtoniyos (hemorrhoids) rule over him - "Hash-m will give you there a raging heart, longing eyes and a worried soul".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>What makes the eyes yearn and the soul worried? Tachtoniyos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Two people from Bei Chuzai accompanied Ula when he came to Eretz Yisrael. One slaughtered the other, and asked Ula if this was proper.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> Yes! Open his neck (so he will die quickly)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Ula):</span> Did I sin by condoning a sinner?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> No, you saved your life!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> How can this be? "There (in Chutz la'Aretz) you will have a raging heart"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> At the time, we were on the other side of the Jordan River (in Chutz la'Aretz).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> Even the Divine Presence is not important to one who gets angry - "A Rasha, at the height of his anger, does not seek - in his plans, he ignores Hash-m".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah mi'Difti):</span> (Anger makes him) forget his learning and increase foolishness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Anger will rest in the lap of fools"; "A fool will spread his foolishness".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Clearly, his sins outnumber his merits - "An angry person has great transgressions".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Had Yisrael not sinned, we would only have received the five Chumashim, and Sefer Yehoshua, which is needed for the boundaries of the tribes in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "In great Chachmah is great anger" (Maharsha - much of Nevi'im and Kesuvim recount Hash-m's anger over Yisrael's sins; Etz Yosef - had Yisrael not sinned with the Eigel, we would have understood everything through the Chumashim, without need for other Sefarim).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>VOWS WE DO NOT PERMIT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> If one mentioned Elokei Yisrael in his oath (some explain, vow), we do not permit it, unless a man vowed that his wife should not benefit from him because she stole his wallet or hit his son, and he later learned that he was mistaken. (Rosh - we are lenient for the sake of Shalom between a man and his wife. Th text should not say 'because she stole... and he learned that he was mistaken', for a mistaken oath need not be permitted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A woman came before Rav Asi; she had mentioned Elokei Yisrael in her vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Asi:</span> Had you vowed with Mohi (i.e. sworn), which is not an actual name of Hash-m, I would (Ran - not) have dealt with you (to permit the oath). Now that you swore using Elokei Yisrael', I will (Ran - certainly) not deal with you!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Kahana visited the house of Rav Yosef.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Eat something.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> (I swear in the name of) the Master of everything, I will not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> No, (I swear in the name of) the Master of everything, you will not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why Rav Kahana swore (so Rav Yosef would not persist to ask him to eat);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But why did Rav Yosef swear?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not swear. Rather, he said 'since you said 'Master of everything', you will not eat.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is, we permit vows through regret, and we permit vows taken with 'Elokei Yisrael.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WAYS OF PROMPTING REGRET</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rava was praising Rav Schorah in front of Rav Nachman. Rav Schorah came before Rav Nachman with a vow to permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nachman suggested things that Rav Schorah might have overlooked when he vowed. Each time, Rav Schorah said that he vowed with that in mind.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Nachman was disturbed. 'Go home' (I cannot permit your vow).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rav Schorah found a Pesach (a reason to considered his vow to be mistaken) to permit his own vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Rebbi) Question:</span> Which is the straight way that a man should choose? Whatever is glory to his Maker and glory to him from people.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Schorah:</span> I did not vow with intent that this would upset Rav Nachman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon b'Rebbi came before Chachamim to permit a vow. They suggested things that he might have overlooked when he vowed. Each time, he said that he vowed with that in mind. Chachamim were pained by this.</p>
