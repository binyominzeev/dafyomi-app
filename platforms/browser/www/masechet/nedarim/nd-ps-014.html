<p class="dedicationbox"><br>12TH CYCLE DEDICATION<br>NEDARIM 12-14 - Two weeks of Dafyomi study material have been dedicated by Ms. Estanne Abraham-Fawer to honor the eighth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EXPLAINING THE <i>MISHNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whom is the Tana?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not R. Meir, who holds that we cannot infer the positive from the negative!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is just like an earlier Mishnah (on 10b! If one said 'l'Chulin (is) what I will eat from you', he is forbidden.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Since we taught about pork and idols, this was repeated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> The Mishnah means that the following are permitted like Chulin: 'like pork, idolatry...' Had it not said 'like Chulin', one might have thought that She'eilah (asking a Chacham to permit them) is required.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We would not have thought that She'eilah is required!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If one told his wife "you are forbidden to me like my mother," we permit it through a different Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> In the Reisha, we do not require She'eilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must rely on Answer #1; Chulin was taught needlessly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the Nedarim in our Mishnah do not forbid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ish Ki Yidor Neder" - Hatfasah must be in Davar ha'Nadur, not in Davar ha'Asur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should expound "Le'esor Isar" to include Hatfasah in Davar ha'Asur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is used to teach about Isar:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa (12a)) Question:</span> What is Isar mentioned in the Torah? ...</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>VOWS OF A <i>CHACHAM</i> THAT DO NOT TAKE EFFECT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one told his wife "you are forbidden to me like my mother" (we permit it through a different Pesach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If a man told his wife "you are forbidden to me like my mother", or his sister, like Orlah, or Kilayim, this has no effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> This has no effect mid'Oraisa, but mid'Rabanan he must permit it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Beraisa discusses a Chacham. Our Mishnah discusses an Am ha'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Also elsewhere we find that an Am ha'Aretz must permit his vow (lest he take vows lightly), but a Talmid Chacham need not:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one vowed (really, swore) b'Torah (by the Torah), it does not take effect. (He swore by the parchment. A Shevu'ah must be with Hash-m's name.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He must ask a Chacham to permit it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Nachman):</span> If a Chacham swore b'Torah, he need not permit it.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one vowed (really, swore) by the Torah, it does not take effect. If he vowed by what is written in it, it takes effect. If he vowed by the Torah and what is written in it, it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a vow by what is written in Torah takes effect, we need not teach that a vow by the Torah and what is written in it takes effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> The first two cases discuss one who holds a Sefer Torah. He refers to the names of Hash-m in it only if he said "what is written in it." In the Seifa, the Torah is on the ground. We assume that he refers to the parchment unless he says b'Torah and what is written in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> In all cases the Torah is on the ground. Even so, if he says "what is written in it" the oath takes effect, and all the more so to if he says "by it and what is written in it."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He holds it only in the Seifa (like Answer #1). The Beraisa teaches that saying "by it" is like saying "by what is written in it."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CONCERN LEST ONE TRANSGRESS A CONDITIONAL VOW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said "Konam that I sleep", or "that I will speak, walk, or have Bi'ah with you (my wife)", Bal Yachel applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> If a man said "Konam (an Isur is upon) my eyes to sleep today if I will sleep tomorrow", he may not sleep today, lest he sleep tomorrow;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> He may sleep today. We are not concerned lest he sleep tomorrow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah agrees that if he said "Konam my eyes to sleep tomorrow if I will sleep today", he may sleep today;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that a person is not careful about a Tnai (even if this causes that he transgressed his vow retroactively), but he is careful about transgressing the vow itself.</p>
