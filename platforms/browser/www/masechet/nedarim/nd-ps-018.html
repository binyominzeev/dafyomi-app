<p class="dedicationbox"><br>12TH CYCLE DEDICATION<br>NEDARIM 16-19 - Two weeks of Dafyomi study material have been dedicated by Ms. Estanne Abraham-Fawer to honor the eighth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ANSWERS FOR RAV HUNA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Really, he said "I will be a Nazir today. I will be a Nazir tomorrow." What he observed fulfills the second Nezirus, except for the last day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He accepted both simultaneously. (There is no reason to say that one takes effect more than the other.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Hamnuna - Beraisa):</span> "Nazir Lehazir" teaches that Nezirus takes effect on Nezirus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Kal v'Chomer suggests that it should not! Shevuos are more stringent, yet a Shevu'ah does not take effect on a Shevu'ah. Nezirus is more lenient, all the more so, Nezirus should not take effect on Nezirus! Therefore, the verse is needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he said "I will be a Nazir today. I will be a Nazir tomorrow", we wouldn't need a verse to teach us that both take effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that he said "I will be a Nazir today. I will be a Nazir today", and both take effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he accepted them simultaneously.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Tana say that Shevuos are more stringent than (Nezirus, i.e.) Nedarim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Shevu'ah takes effect even on something intangible.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There is also a stringency of Nedarim, i.e. they take effect even on Mitzvos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Lo Yenakeh (Hash-m will not cleanse one who swore falsely.)"</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO SWORE TWICE ABOUT THE SAME MATTER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said "Shevu'ah, I will not eat this. Shevu'ah, I will not eat this" and he ate it, he is liable only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> If he permitted the first oath, the second takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He derived this from the Mishnah. "He is liable only once" connotes that there is no room for the second oath to take effect, but when he permits the first (and there is room), it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Inference:</span> He is not liable for the second, but it is a Shevu'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what sense is it a Shevu'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Rava taught, that if he permits the first, the second takes effect. (end of Version #2. Pores Yosef - according to Version #1, he cannot permit the second Shevu'ah before the first, for it merely a potential Shevu'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one accepted two terms of Nezirus, observed one, was Makdish a Korban for it, and then permitted his first Nezirus, what he observed counts for the second.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps he accepted both terms at once.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WE ARE STRINGENT ABOUT <i>NEDARIM</i> UNTIL THEY ARE EXPLAINED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> We are stringent about a Stam (unspecified) Neder. If he explained it, we are lenient;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a person forbade something "like salted meat" or "like Yayin Nesech (libations of wine)":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he (says that he) referred to a Shelamim (some texts - of Shamayim), he is forbidden. If he referred to idolatry, he is permitted. (Idolatry is Davar ha'Asur, not Devar ha'Nadur.) If he vowed Stam, he is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he said 'this is like Cherem to me":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he referred to Cherem of Shamayim (Hekdesh Bedek ha'Bayis), he is forbidden. If he referred to Cherem that is given to Kohanim, he is permitted. (Presumably, he refers to after the Kohen gets it. It is permitted then.) If he vowed Stam, he is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he said "this is like Ma'aser to me":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he referred to Ma'aser Beheimah, he is forbidden. If he referred to Ma'aser of produce, he is permitted. If he vowed Stam, he is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If he said "this is like Terumah to me":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he referred to Terumas ha'Lishkah (Shekalim taken to buy Korbanos), he is forbidden. If he referred to Terumah of produce, he is permitted. If he did not specify, he is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah says, in Yehudah, if he said Terumah Stam, he is forbidden. In Galil, he is permitted, for there (they are far from Yerushalayim, so) people are not familiar with (and do not regularly discuss) Terumas ha'Lishkah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If he said Cherem Stam, in Yehudah he is permitted. In Galil he is forbidden, for people there are not familiar with Cherem of Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DO PEOPLE FORBID THINGS DUE TO A <i>SAFEK</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #1):</span> We are lenient about Safek Nezirus. (Our Mishnah is stringent about Safek Nedarim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> Mishnah #1 is like R. Eliezer Our Mishnah is like Chachamim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was Makdish his Chayah or his Beheimah (his wild or domestic animal; Rashi - he was Makdish both of them), his Koy (a Safek Chayah, Safek Beheimah) becomes Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, it is not Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say that a person forbids his property due to a Safek, and similarly regarding (forbidding) himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Eliezer holds that one does not forbid his property due to a Safek, and all the more so regarding himself.</p>
