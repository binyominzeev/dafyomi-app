<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, she said 'the pleasure of washing is forbidden to me if I bathe.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He can annul this, for it will cause affliction;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she washes (once), she cannot wash again. If she does not wash, she will become repulsive!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi holds that she can refrain from washing. We are not concerned if she becomes repulsive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, R. Yosi should say 'this is not a stipulation of affliction!' (Ran - 'these are not vows of affliction' connotes that if the vow was affliction, e.g. I will not eat, even if it was conditional on washing, he would be able to annul it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, she said 'the pleasure of washing is permanently forbidden to me if I bathe today'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi says, not washing for one day is not considered becoming so repulsive. It is not grounds to allow annulment.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of the other vow in the Mishnah, 'if I will not wash'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> She said 'the pleasure of washing is forbidden to me if I do not bathe today.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why can he annul? Let her bathe today!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> She said 'the pleasure of washing is forbidden to me if I do not bathe today in (stinking) water in which flax was soaked.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, we must explain the case of 'if I will not adorn myself' to mean 'I will not adorn myself in kerosene';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>That is filth, not adornment!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The case of 'if I will wash' is, she said 'the pleasure of washing is permanently forbidden to me if I bathe today.' 'If I will not wash' is when she swore not to bathe;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'If I will adorn myself' is when she said 'the pleasure of adornment is permanently forbidden to me if I adorn myself today.' 'If I will not adorn myself' is when she swore not to adorn herself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If so, the Mishnah should say 'these are vows and oaths'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> Indeed, that is the correct text!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Oaths are also called vows;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed, accepted Nezirus, or swore 'like vows of the wicked', it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS NOT BATHING CONSIDERED AFFLICTION?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do Chachamim really hold that not bathing (for one day) is affliction?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Even though one must observe all the afflictions of Yom Kipur, one is Chayav Kares only for eating, drinking, or doing labor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If not bathing is affliction, one should be Chayav Kares for bathing! (It says "whoever will not afflict himself will get Kares"!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Not bathing is sometimes considered affliction, depending on the context.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Yom Kipur, it says "You will afflict your souls" - an affliction which is felt now (the same day);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who does not bathe does not feel affliction until later.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Regarding vows, it says "every vow... to afflict the soul." This refers to something that will come to afflict. This includes not bathing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We use water from a spring of the city first to sustain the life of the inhabitants of the city, before using it to sustain others;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The animals of the inhabitants of the city have precedence (to take water) over others' animals;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The laundry of the inhabitants of the city takes precedence over that of others;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The life of others takes precedence over the laundry of the inhabitants of the city;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yosi says, the laundry of the inhabitants of the city takes precedence over the life of others.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of contradiction):</span> R. Yosi holds that there is pain even in refraining from laundering. All the more so, not bathing is affliction!</p>
