<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>MISHNAH</i>: CASES OF <i>NEDARIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Assumption:</span> 'L'Chulin' means, it is not like Chulin, rather, like a Korban. (We never retract from this assumption.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is our Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not like R. Meir. He holds that we do not infer the positive from the negative!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Any Tnai (stipulation) that is not (doubled) like the stipulation made with Bnei Gad and Bnei Reuven (if they will cross the Yarden to fight the Kena'ani nations, they will receive Eretz Gil'ad; if not, not) is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa - R. Yehudah):</span> Saying 'Yerushalayim' does not forbid at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that the Reisha is not R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The entire Mishnah is R. Yehudah. The Seifa means '(he is forbidden only if he says 'like Yerushalayim',) because R. Yehudah says that one who says (only) 'Yerushalayim' does not forbid at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah permits even one who said like Yerushalayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Beraisa - R. Yehudah) Forbidding something "like Yerushalayim" has no effect, unless he forbids like something offered in Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the entire is like R. Yehudah. Tana'im argue about the opinion of R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If someone said "Chulin", "the Chulin," or "like Chulin," whether he concluded "(is) that I will eat of yours" or "that I will not eat of yours," he is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If he said "l'Chulin (is) what I will eat of yours," he is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If he said "l'Chulin (is) what I will not eat of yours," he is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is R. Meir, who does not infer the positive from the negative.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa is unlike R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Mishnah - R. Meir) If one says "l'Korban (is) what I will not eat of yours," he is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (He means, Lo Korban is what I will not eat of yours, but what I eat of yours is a Korban.) R. Meir does not infer the positive from the negative!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> He means "what I eat from you is like a Korban, therefore I will not eat from you."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> (The middle clause shows that 'l'Chulin' can also mean 'not Chulin, rather, Korban.') Also here, we should say that he means "what I eat from you is not Chulin, therefore I will not eat from you", and he is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana of the Beraisa agrees with R. Meir about one matter, and argues about another;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He agrees that we do not infer the positive from the negative;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He argue about "(l')Korban" (and "l'Chulin". He does not explain these to mean "what I eat from you is like ..., therefore...")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Ashi):</span> (The entire Beraisa is R. Meir.) When he says "la'Chulin" (with a Patach), we explain this to mean 'Lo Chulin, rather, a Korban'. In the Seifa he said "l'Chulin", which means "it is Chulin."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IN WHAT IS ONE <i>MATFIS</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If one said 'this is forbidden to me like meat of a Shelamim after Zerikah (throwing the blood on the Mizbe'ach)', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Basar Shelamim after Zerikah is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, a Chulin piece was next to a piece of Shelamim after Zerikah, and he said "this is like this";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Is he Matfis (forbid one matter with the Isur of another) in the initial Isur (before Zerikah), or in its (current) Heter?</p>
