<p class=newsubafdaf><span class=numt>1)</span> OFFERING THE <i>TAMID</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span><span class=desl1>	(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> They would not break the foot of the lamb. They would only pierce it and hang the animal from the ankle. He flayed it until the chest, then cut off the head and feet (all four, until the lowest knee) and gave them to the Kohanim who would offer them.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	He washed the flayed animal, tore the heart and removed its blood. He cut off the forelegs and right hind leg with the Beitzim.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span>	He tore open the animal. It was all exposed. He took the Pader (Chelev of the stomach) and put it on top of the Beis ha'Shechitah (the cut neck; the head was held with the neck up);</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span>	He gave the innards to the Kohen who would rinse and offer them. The stomach was rinsed elsewhere (Rosh - in a Lishkah, for we do not want its excrement in the Azarah), as much as necessary.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span>	The innards were rinsed at least three times on marble tables between the pillars.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span>	He took the knife and separated the lungs from the liver, and the diaphragm from the liver, without moving the diaphragm. He removed the Chazeh (chest) and gave it to the one who would offer it.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(g)</span>	When he reached the right flank, he would cut until the spine. He would cut the spine only between two thin (some texts - soft) ribs; he cut it (the right flank) off and gave it to the one who would offer it, with the liver attached.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(h)</span>	He came to the neck; he left two ribs attached on each side, cut it off and gave it to the one who would offer it, with the windpipe, heart and lungs attached.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(i)</span>	He came to the left flank, he left two ribs attached above and below (he did the same regarding the right flank). He cut it off and gave it to the one who would offer it, with the spine and spleen attached;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	The left flank was bigger, but the right flank was called the great one because the liver was attached to it.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(j)</span>	He came to the Oketz (end of the spine). He cut it off and gave it to the one who would offer it, with the tail, diaphragm and both kidneys attached.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(k)</span>	He cut off the left hind leg and gave it to the one who would offer it.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(l)</span>	All the Kohanim (who would offer the limbs) were in a line holding the limbs;</p>
<p class=bbbline>31b----------------------------------------31b</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	The first held the head in his right hand. The nose faced his arm, and the horns were between his fingers. The Beis ha'Shechitah faced up, and the Chelev was on top of it;</p>
<p class=thirdindent><span class=numl3>i.</span>	His left hand held the right leg. The outside (where the skin was, before it was flayed) faced out.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	The second Kohen held the right foreleg in his right hand and the left foreleg in his left hand. The outsides faced out.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>3.</span>	The third held the Oketz in his right hand, with the tail between his fingers, and the diaphragm and kidneys attached;</p>
<p class=thirdindent><span class=numl3>i.</span>	The left hind leg was in his left hand. The outside faced out.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>4.</span>	The fourth held the Chazeh in his right hand, and the neck in his left hand, with its attached ribs between his fingers.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>5.</span>	The fifth held the right flank in his right hand and the left flank in his left hand. The outsides faced out.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>6.</span>	The sixth held the innards in a Kli, with the feet on top.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>7.</span>	The seventh held the Soles. The eighth held the Chavitim. The ninth held the wine.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(m)</span>	All these Kohanim went no more than half-way up the ramp, put down the limbs on the west side of the ramp, salted them, and descended to recite Shma in the Lishkas ha'Gazis.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(n)</span><span class=desl1>	(Gemara):</span> Akeidah is tying the hand (foreleg) to the hind leg, like Akeidas Yitzchak. (We do so to recall the merit of the Akeidah.)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(o)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah):</span> They would not tie (all four legs of) the lamb.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(p)</span>	Question: What is the reason?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(q)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer #1 (Rav Huna or Rav Chisda):</span> This would be a disgrace to Kodshim.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(r)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer #2 (the other of Rav Huna and Rav Chisda):</span> This is the statute of idolaters (Rosh - of Tzedukim, people who rejected the oral tradition).</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(s)</span>	Question: What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(t)</span>	Answer: Answer #1 permits tying it with silk or with gold threads, Answer #2 forbids.</p>
<p class=newsubject><span class=numt>2)</span> THE SHULCHANOS</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah):</span> There were 13 tables in the Mikdash:</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	Eight marble tables were near the pillars. Innards were rinsed on them;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	There was a marble table to the west of the ramp, on which limbs were placed, and a silver table on which Klei Shares were placed.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>3.</span>	There was a silver (Bach, and the text in Shekalim - marble) table in the Ulam, at the entrance (of the Heichal) on which Lechem ha'Panim was put when (Kohanim stopped to rest when) bringing it into the Heichal, and one of gold on which Lechem ha'Panim was put when it was taken out (until the Levonah was offered). This is because we ascend in Kedushah, but we do not descend. (The Lechem was on a gold-plated table in the Heichal during the week.)</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>4.</span>	The last was the gold (covered) table in the Heichal on which the Lechem ha'Panim was always arranged.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	Question: Why were some tables of marble? All should be silver or gold. We do not show poverty in the place of wealth!</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (R. Chanina):</span> Silver and gold get hot. They could cause the meat to spoil.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah):</span> The morning Tamid was slaughtered near the northwest corner.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span>	Question: What is the source for this?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> "Shenayim la'Yom" teaches that the Temidim must be slaughtered "k'Neged la'Yom," i.e. opposite (or even with) the sun.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(g)</span>	Question: Perhaps this merely teaches that two must be brought each day!</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(h)</span>	Answer: "Es ha'Keves Echad Ta'aseh va'Boker v'Es ha'Keves ha'Sheni Ta'aseh Bein ha'Arbayim" already teaches this, so "Shenayim la'Yom" teaches about k'Neged la'Yom;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	The morning Tamid was slaughtered near the northwest corner, in the second ring. The afternoon Tamid was slaughtered near the southwest corner, in the second ring.</p>
