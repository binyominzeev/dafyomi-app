<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SERVING FROM LOVE AND FEAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On that day, R. Eliezer ben Horkinus expounded that Iyov served...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Tana consider two possible interpretations of the word "Lo"? If it is spelled with an Alef, it means 'No'. If it is spelled with a Vav, it means 'to Him'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is not true! "In all their afflictions, Lo it grieves", and it is spelled with an Alef!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it means that Hash-m is not grieved.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "An angel of His countenance saved them (in His love and mercy...)"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Really, either way the word is spelled, it can have either meaning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> It says "who fears Hash-m" regarding both Iyov and Avraham;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Avraham's fear stemmed from love, also Iyov's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Avraham's fear stemmed from love?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Avraham, who loves Me."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between one who serves from love and one who serves from fear?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> One who serves from love is greater than one who serves from fear. The reward for the former extends to 2000 generations, and for the latter, to 1000;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My Mitzvos", and "to those who keep My Mitzvos, to a thousand generations."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also the latter verse discusses those who serve from love - "to those who love Me and keep My Mitzvos, to a thousand generations"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Thousands" is immediately followed by "to those who love Me." "To those who keep My Mitzvos" is immediately followed by "for a thousand generations."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Two Talmidim or Rava had dreams. One was shown the verse "how great is the good stored away for those who fear You." The other saw the verse "all who trust in You will rejoice in You. Those who love Your name will forever sing and exult in You."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Both of you are total Tzadikim. The former serves from fear, the latter serves from love.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN A HUSBAND CANNOT MAKE HIS WIFE DRINK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a man warned his wife and she was secluded, even if he hears (of the seclusion) from a bird, he (makes her drink or) must divorce her and pay her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehoshua says, he need not divorce her unless women who weave in the moonlight talk about her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one witness testifies that she had Bi'ah, she does not drink. Even a male or female slave is believed, even to deprive her of her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(The women suspected of hating her, i.e.) her mother-in-law, her mother-in-law's daughter, her co-wife, her husband's brother's wife, or her husband's daughter (from a different wife) are believed to prevent her from drinking, but not to deprive her of her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If we require two witnesses for the first testimony (seclusion), which does not permanently forbid her, all the more so, the latter testimony (Tum'ah), which permanently forbids her, should require two witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Ed Ein Bah" - any testimony (of Tum'ah, even one witness, would be believed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The latter testimony, which permanently forbids her, needs only one witness. All the more one witness should suffice for the first testimony, which does not permanently forbid her!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says about adultery "Ki Matza Vah Ervas Davar", and about monetary cases it says "according to two or three witnesses a Davar (matter) will be established";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like two witnesses are needed there, also regarding seclusion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If one witness says that she had Bi'ah, and one says that she did not, or a woman says that she was defiled and another woman says that she was not, the Sotah drinks;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If one witness says that she had Bi'ah, and two say that she did not, she drinks;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If two say that she had Bi'ah, and one says that she did not, she does not drink.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TWO WITNESSES ARE NEEDED FOR SECLUSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say that we learn that seclusion needs two witnesses from "Ki Matza Vah Ervas Davar"? We learn from "V'Ed Ein Bah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One witness suffices "Bah" (for Tum'ah), but not for warning or seclusion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this is what the Mishnah means!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Ed Ein Bah" - one witness suffices for Tum'ah, but not for warning or seclusion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to require two witnesses about adultery if there was no warning and seclusion?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Ki Matza Vah Ervas Davar", and "according to two witnesses... a Davar..." Just like two witnesses are needed there, also for seclusion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one witness says that she was defiled...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> She drinks because a second witness contradicted the first. If there were a lone witness of adultery, he would be believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "There is not a witness about her" means, there are not two witnesses about her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it means that there is not even one witness?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection - Question:</span> It says "one witness will not rise against a man." 'Witness' implies one. Why did the Torah need to say "<i>one</i> witness"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that in the entire Torah, 'witness' refers to two witnesses, unless the Torah specifies one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Culmination of answer):</span> The Torah said that there is not a (really, two) witness(es) about her, rather one, and if "she was not forced", she is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since one witness is believed mid'Oraisa that she is forbidden, how can the other witness contradict him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ula taught that wherever the Torah believes one witness, he is believed like two. The other witness is not believed against two!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula and R. Yitzchak):</span> The Mishnah should say that she does not drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> She drinks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Chiya answer question (g)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah discusses when the witnesses testify 'together' (within Toch Kedei Dibur of each other). Ula's law (the first witness is believed like two) applies only when the witness of Tum'ah came first (and there was a delay before the other witnesses came).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one witness says that she was defiled, and two say that she was not, she drinks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If only one witness said that she is innocent, she would not drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This refutes R. Chiya!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Reisha):</span> If two say that she was defiled, and one says that she was not, she does not drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If only one witness said she was defiled, she would drink. (This supports R. Chiya and refutes Ula!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> Both Ula and R. Chiya must explain that these last two clauses of the Mishnah discuss invalid witnesses, like R. Nechemyah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nechemyah):</span> Wherever the Torah believed one witness, we follow the majority;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Two women who contradict a man are like two men who contradict a man (and they are believed. One woman is not believed to contradict a man.)</p>
