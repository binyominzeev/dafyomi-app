<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO SAYS THAT <i>CHULIN </i>CANNOT BECOME A <i>SHLISHI</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> The following Tana'im all hold that a Sheni cannot make a Shlishi in Chulin: R. Meir, R. Yosi, R. Yehoshua, R. Elazar, and R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Anyone who must immerse mid'Rabanan (is like a Sheni. He is) Metamei Kodshim (to disqualify other Kodshim), disqualifies Terumah, and is Tahor regarding Chulin and Ma'aser (Sheni);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, he is forbidden to Ma'aser. (Also Chachamim hold that a Sheni cannot make a Shlishi in Chulin. Rav Asi listed only names of Tana'im who say so.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Our Beraisa shows that R. Yosi holds that there is no Shlishi in Chulin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there were, he would learn from his Kal va'Chomer that there is a Revi'i in Terumah, and a Chamishi in Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The following Mishnah teaches about R. Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If one eats a Rishon, he becomes a Rishon. If one eats a Sheni, he becomes a Sheni. If one eats a Shlishi, he becomes a Shlishi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, one who eats a Rishon or Sheni becomes a Sheni. One who eats a Shlishi becomes a Sheni regarding Kodshim, but he is Tahor regarding Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Shlishi he may eat (for which he becomes a Sheni regarding Kodshim) is Chulin guarded like Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> (If the Chulin was guarded like Kodshim, (it is like regular Chulin), and - Rashi's preferred text omits all this) there is no decree about regular Chulin (because R. Yehoshua holds that there is no Shlishi in Chulin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> A Rishon, whether it is Chulin, Terumah, or Kodshim, is Metamei two Kodshim foods, and disqualifies a third;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is Metamei one Terumah food, and disqualifies a second food;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It disqualifies (only) one Chulin food (because there is no Shlishi in Chulin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> Tahor Chalah may be separated to exempt Tamei dough;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one has a Tahor dough and a Tamei dough, he takes the proper amount for Chalah from a dough Tevel to Chalah (i.e. Chalah has not yet been separated from it), and puts dough less than a k'Beitzah (the volume of an egg) between and touching the two doughs. In this way, he separates from connected pieces of dough;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim forbid taking Chalah this way.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> One puts a k'Beitzah of dough between the doughs.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> In both Beraisos, the Tamei dough is a Rishon. The Tana holds that dough Tevel to Chalah (cannot become a Shlishi), for it is not considered like Chalah (which is like Terumah);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Tana of the Mishnah holds that Chulin can become a Shlishi (therefore, he may not put a k'Beitzah of dough in between, for it would become a Sheni and make the other dough a Shlishi). The Tana of the Beraisa holds that Chulin cannot become a Shlishi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and resolution #1 - Rav Mari brei d'Rav Kahana):</span> No, all hold that Chulin cannot become a Shlishi. They argue about whether or not dough Tevel to Chalah is like Chalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Tana of the Mishnah holds that it is. The Tana of the Beraisa holds that it is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> All hold that dough Tevel to Chalah is not like Chalah, and that Chulin cannot become a Shlishi. They argue about whether or not one may be Metamei Chulin in Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Tana of the Mishnah forbids. The Tana of the Beraisa permits.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE ARGUMENT ABOUT CITIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On that day, R. Akiva expounded... (2000 Amos is the Techum Shabbos. R. Eliezer says, the second 1000 Amos are for fields and vineyards.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva holds that the Isur to leave the Techum is mid'Oraisa. R. Eliezer holds that it is mid'Rabanan (so the verse cannot discuss it).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SONG AFTER <i>KERI'AS YAM SUF</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> On that day, R. Akiva expounded that when Yisrael came ashore from the Yam Suf, they decided to sing. Moshe and Yisrael sang like an adult leading the Tzibur in Hallel. They answer the start of the Perek;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moshe sang "I will sing to Hash-m." They answered "I will sing to Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Moshe sang "for He is greatly exalted." They answered "I will sing to Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer the son of R. Yosi ha'Glili says, they sang like a minor leading the Tzibur in Hallel. (They are not Yotzei through the minor, so) they repeat everything that he says:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moshe sang "I will sing to Hash-m." They answered "I will sing to Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Moshe sang "for He is greatly exalted." They answered "for He is greatly exalted."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Nechemyah says, they sang like a teacher leading the Tzibur in the Berachos of Shema Yisrael. He begins, and they continue.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva expounds "(then Moshe sang and Bnei Yisrael...and they said) saying" - they kept saying the first thing that Moshe said;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer says, "saying" refers to everything Moshe said;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Nechemyah expounds "and they said" to teach that they all said together. "Saying" teaches that Moshe began for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> When Yisrael alighted from the sea, they wanted to sing. When an infant on his mother's knees and a nursing baby saw the Divine Presence, the infant raised his neck and the baby stopped nursing, and they sang "this is my G-d and I will glorify Him";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn this from "from the mouth of infants and nursing babies, You established strength."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Meir says, even fetuses in the womb sang - "in congregations, bless Hash-m from the source of Yisrael."</p>
