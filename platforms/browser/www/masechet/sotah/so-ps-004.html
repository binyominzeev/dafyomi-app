<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE DURATION OF SECLUSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> The first testimony (in the Mishnah) is about seclusion; the latter testimony is about adultery.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What duration is considered seclusion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is long enough for Tum'ah (adultery); for Bi'ah; for Ha'ara'ah (the first stage of Bi'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael says, it is the time needed to go around a palm tree;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, it is the time needed to mix a drink;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehoshua says, it is the time needed to drink it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Ben Azai says, it is the time needed to roast an egg;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Akiva says, it is the time needed to eat it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira says, it is the time needed to eat three eggs, one after the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>R. Eliezer ben Yirmeyah says, it is the time needed to tie two strands;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>R. Chanan ben Pinchas says, it is the time needed to stick her hand into her mouth to remove a chip of wood;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>Plimo says, it is the time needed to stick her hand into a basket to remove a loaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A hint (not a proof) for this is "for a prostitute, up to a loaf of bread."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa gives three descriptions (of the time for seclusion)- for Tum'ah; for Bi'ah; for Ha'ara'ah. Why are all these needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said only for Tum'ah, one might have thought that it is for Tum'ah and consent. 'For Bi'ah' teaches that we do not need the time for consent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it said only 'for Bi'ah', one might have thought for full Bi'ah. 'For Ha'ara'ah' teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it said only for Ha'ara'ah, one might have thought that it is for Ha'ara'ah and consent. 'For Tum'ah teaches that we do not need the time for consent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yishmael says, the time needed for Ha'ara'ah is...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> "She was defiled" teaches that the duration of seclusion is the time needed for adultery, for Bi'ah, for Ha'ara'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer says, this is the time needed for a palm tree to return (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, it is the time needed to mix a drink;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Ben Azai says, it is the time needed to drink it;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira says, it is the time needed to eat it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>We are thinking that the time to go around a palm tree and the time for a palm tree to return are the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction #1:</span> In Beraisa #1, R. Yishmael said the time to go around a palm tree, and R. Eliezer argued. In Beraisa #2, R. Eliezer said the time needed for a palm tree to return!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> 'The time to go around' means to walk around it. 'The time to return' means for a branch to return (after the wind swayed it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Is this the time to return to its initial position, or the time to come to rest?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction #2:</span> In Beraisa #1, R. Eliezer said the time to mix a drink. In Beraisa #2, he said the time needed for a palm tree to return!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These are the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction #3:</span> In Beraisa #1, R. Yehoshua said the time to drink it. In Beraisa #2, he said the time to mix it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Both times) he meant the time to mix and drink it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't we answer that the time to mix it equals the time to drink it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, in Beraisa #1 R. Yehoshua would be just like R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction #4:</span> In Beraisa #1, Ben Azai said the time to roast an egg. In Beraisa #2, he says the time to drink a cup!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These are the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction #5:</span> In Beraisa #1, R. Akiva said the time to eat (an egg). Here, he says the time to roast it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Both times) he means the time to roast and eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't we answer that the time to roast it equals the time to eat it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, in Beraisa #1 he would agree with Ben Azai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction #6:</span> In Beraisa #1, R. Yehudah ben Beseira said the time to eat three eggs. Here, he says the time to eat one!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not give his own opinion. Rather, he criticized R. Akiva's opinion:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva said that it is the time to roast and eat an egg. R. Yehudah ben Beseira said, he should give the Shi'ur purely in terms of eating, namely, the time to eat three eggs. (It seems that this is another answer to Question p:1. If the time to roast and egg equaled the time to eat it, we could not explain R. Yehudah ben Beseira.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CLARIFYING THE OPINIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yirmeyah):</span> It is the time to tie two strands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Is this when they are far apart or close together?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chanan ben Pinchas):</span> It is the time needed to stick her hand into her mouth to remove a chip of wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Is this when it is stuck, or when it is not?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Plimo):</span> It is the time needed to stick her hand into a basket to remove a loaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Questions (Rav Ashi):</span> Is this when it is stuck, or not? It is a new basket, or an old one? Is the bread warm or cold? It is of wheat or of barley? It is soft or hard (kneading)?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>These questions are unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> Each Tana estimated the time he takes for Ha'ara'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Ben Azai was never married!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He married, but soon separated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He taught what he heard from his Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "Hash-m reveals secrets to those who fear Him."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WASHING THE HANDS FOR A MEAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Avira):</span> Anyone who eats bread without washing his hands is like one who has Bi'ah with a harlot - "for a harlot, up to a loaf of bread."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> According to you, the verse should say 'for a loaf of bread, up to a harlot'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, the verse teaches that anyone who has Bi'ah with a harlot will eventually beg for bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zerika):</span> Anyone who disgraces washing hands is uprooted from the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> When washing before the meal, one must tilt his hands upwards; when washing after the meal, one must tilt his hands downwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> When washing before the meal, one must tilt his hands upwards, lest the water leave the palm and (the second pouring will not be Metaher the first water, and the first water will) return and be Metamei the hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Anyone who eats bread without drying his hands is like one who eats Tamei bread - "Hash-m said, so will Yisrael eat their bread, Tamei." (Rashi - this is despised. Ritva (Chulin 107a) - the water becomes Tamei, and it is Metamei the bread.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HAUGHTINESS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "a married woman will trap a Yekarah (heavy or precious) soul"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Anyone who is haughty will eventually stumble with (seduce) a married woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rava):</span> If so, the verse should say "a high soul"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rava):</span> Also, it should say "the soul will trap her"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Anyone who has Bi'ah with a married woman, even if he learned Torah, which is "more precious than Peninim (pearls)", i.e. dearer than the Kohen Gadol, who enters Lifnai v'Lifnim (the innermost part of the Mikdash), she snares him to judgment in Gehinom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan, citing R. Shimon):</span> If one has haughtiness, it is as if he serves idols.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "every haughty heart is an abomination to Hash-m", and "do not bring an abomination into your house."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan himself):</span> It is as if he denies Hash-m - "your heart will rise, and you will forget Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama bar Chanina):</span> It is as if he had Bi'ah with all the Arayos (incestuous relationships). It says "every haughty heart is an abomination to Hash-m", just like "all of these abominations."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> It is as if he built a Bamah (private Mizbe'ach, when these are forbidden) - "Refrain from a man who esteems his soul. Ba'Meh (as what) is he considered?"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We read "ba'Meh" like Bamah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from the end of the verse "hand to hand will not be cleansed"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> Anyone who has Bi'ah with a married woman, even if he declared Hash-m to be sovereign over Heaven and earth, like Avraham did, he will not be exempt from punishment in Gehinom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Avraham said "I raise my hand to Hash-m, the Supreme G-d, owner of Heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (d'Vei R. Shila):</span> If so, the verse should say "my hand" (like Avraham said)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (d'Vei R. Shila):</span> Even if he received Torah, "a law of fire from His right hand", like Moshe Rabeinu did, he will not be exempt from punishment in Gehinom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yochanan):</span> If so, it should say "hand from hand"!</p>
