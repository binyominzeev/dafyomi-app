<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SPIES RETURN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>"They went and they came (to Moshe)" equates their going to their return,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like they returned with an evil counsel, they went with an evil counsel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(R. Yochanan) "And they said '... (the land flows with milk and honey...) but it is for naught, for the inhabitants are (too) strong." (They began with praise of the land, because) if Lashon ha'Ra (slander) does not include some truth at the beginning, it will not last.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> "And Kalev hushed the nation towards Moshe" - he enticed them with words.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He saw that when Yehoshua tried to speak, they silenced him. 'If one's head is cut off, can he speak?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He reasoned - if I defend Eretz Yisrael, they will silence me also.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He said 'is this the only thing Moshe did to us?!' They thought that he was going to criticize Moshe, so they let him continue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He took us out of Mitzrayim, he split the sea for us, he brought manna down for us. If he would tell us to make ladders and ascend to Heaven, wouldn't we listen?! "We will go up and inherit the land!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> "The Meraglim who went with him said 'we cannot... he (the nation there) is stronger Mimenu.'" Do not read 'than us', rather, 'than He.' (Rashi, Tosfos Erchin 15b - the word is pronounced the same either way. Ibn Ezra (Shemos 1:9) and Teshuvas Rashba (attributed to Ramban) 232 - western Sefarim (which follow the tradition of Eretz Yisrael) have a Dagesh (dot) in the Nun either way, but eastern Sefarim (which follow the tradition of Bavel) have no dot when it means 'than us'.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is as if they said that the Owner of the house cannot retrieve His Kelim from His house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "The land consumes its inhabitants" - Hash-m intended to help them, but they viewed it negatively;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Wherever the Meraglim went, an important Kena'ani died. This distracted the Kena'anim, so they did not occupy themselves with the Meraglim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Others explain that Iyov had died, and all were busy eulogizing him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mesharshiya):</span> "We were like grasshoppers in our eyes, and also in their eyes" - this was a falsity!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They could know how they viewed themselves, but they could not know how the Kena'anim viewed them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They could know! The Kena'anim would give a first meal to a mourner under a cedar tree. When the Meraglim were seen, they climbed into trees. They heard the Kena'anim say that they saw ant-sized people in the trees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>"The whole Tzibur raised their voices and cried" - it was the eve of the Tishah b'Av. Hash-m said 'they cried for no reason. I will fix the day to be a day of crying for generations.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> "The whole Tzibur said that they will stone them (Yehoshua and Kalev). And the honor of Hash-m (appeared in the Ohel Mo'ed)" - they threw stones up towards Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "The men who gave a bad report of the land died harshly in a plague" - this was a bizarre death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> Their tongues hung out and stretched to their bellybuttons. Worms came from their tongues and entered their bellybuttons and vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Rav Papa):</span> They died of croup.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TRANSPORTING THE <i>ARON</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Once the last Yisrael alighted from the Jordan, the water returned to its place - "when the Kohanim, carriers of the Aron, alighted from the Jordan, their feet touched the dry land, and the water returned like it used to be, on all its banks."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Aron, its carriers, and the Kohanim were on one side of the Jordan, and Yisrael were on the other side.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"When Yisrael finished crossing, the Aron and the Kohanim passed in front of the nation" - the Aron carried its carriers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Uza was punished for not learning from this. "When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uza stuck out his hand to hold the Aron."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hash-m rebuked him. The Aron can even carry its carriers. All the more so, it can carry itself! "Hash-m's anger flared at Uza. He struck him there on the Shal."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan or R. Elazar):</span> For his (she'Lo) affairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Yochanan and R. Elazar):</span> He relieved himself in front of the Aron.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "He died there with the Aron of Hash-m" teaches that Uza came to the world to come;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like the Aron lasts forever, also Uza.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Va'Yichar (it was distressing) to David that Hash-m made a breach regarding Uza" - his face turned white like a Chararah (cake).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Should we expound every occurrence of 'va'Yichar' this way?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Elsewhere, it says 'va'Yichar Af' (his anger flared). Here, it says only "va'Yichar".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> David was punished because he called words of Torah 'songs' - "Your statutes were songs to me."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m rebuked him. It says about Divrei Torah "wink your eye (for one moment, neglect) them, and they are gone." Do you call them songs?! I will make you stumble in something that even children learning (Chumash) from their Rebbi know!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"He did not give (wagons) to (the Leviyim,) Bnei Kehas, because they carry the most Kodesh things (rather, they will carry on their shoulders)." David brought the Aron on a wagon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "He struck the men of Beis Shemesh, because they saw the Aron." Is this a reason to strike them?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu or R. Elazar):</span> They bowed to it without pausing from reaping.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of R. Avahu and R. Elazar):</span> They also spoke disrespectfully - 'who angered you (the Aron, that you allowed yourself to be captured), and who appeased you (that you returned on your own)?'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">35b----------------------------------------35b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu or R. Elazar):</span> "He struck among the people 70 men and 50,000 men" - 70 died, and each was worthy like 50,000;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Avahu and R. Elazar):</span> He killed 50,000, and each was worthy like 70, the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> One verse says "when the carriers of the Aron took six steps, they offered a bull and a fattened bull." Another verse says "seven bulls and seven rams"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1: (Rav Papa bar Shmuel):</span> After each step, a bull and fattened bull; after every six steps, seven bulls and seven rams.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Chisda):</span> If they offered after every step, the whole land would be full of Bamos (private altars)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> After every six steps, they offered a bull and fattened bull. After every six sets of steps, they offered seven bulls and seven rams.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> One verse says "(the threshing floor of) Kidon." Another verse calls it "Nachon"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> First it was Kidon (like a spear, i.e. it caused Uza's death). Later it was Nachon (it established the family of Oved Edom, by whom the Aron stayed, with many children).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE ROCKS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There were three sets of rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moshe set up rocks in Mo'av - "in Mo'av, Moshe started to explain." We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah from "You will write on them (the rocks) the Torah (well explained)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Yehoshua set up 12 rocks in the Jordan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Yehoshua set up 12 other rocks in Gilgal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "You will write on the rocks this entire Torah", and afterwards "you will plaster over them."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimon):</span> If so, how were the Nochrim able to learn it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah):</span> Hash-m gave them extra cleverness. They sent scribes who peeled off the plaster and copied the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since they had the opportunity to learn, but did not, they were condemned to Gehinom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon says, they wrote the Torah over the plaster. At the bottom they wrote "(you will kill the seven Kena'ani nations) so they will not teach you to do like all (their abominations)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that if Kena'anim outside of Eretz Yisrael (whom we were not commanded to kill) wanted to convert, we would have accepted them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Shila):</span> R. Shimon learns from "The nations will be like fired plaster" - due to affairs of plaster.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah explains, just like plaster can be fixed only through fire, Nochrim can be purified only through fire (of Gehinom).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like which Tana is the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "And you will capture a captive (and desire her)" includes Kena'anim in Chutz la'Aretz, that we accept them to be converts if they repent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Shimon.</p>
