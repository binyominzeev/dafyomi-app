<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CAN A WOMAN BE GIVEN TO DRINK TWICE? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (Rava):</span> All agree that the same husband cannot make her drink again for seclusion with the same man, since it says "this";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>All agree that a different husband can make her drink again for seclusion with a different man, since it says "Toras";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They argue in two cases, if she was secluded with the same man under (while married to) a different husband, and if she was secluded with a different man under the same husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana holds that "Toras" teaches that she always drinks again. "This" teaches that she does not drink again for seclusion with the same man under the same husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The last Tana holds that "this" teaches that she never drinks again. "Toras" teaches that she drinks again for seclusion with a different man under a different husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah holds that "this" excludes two cases, and "Toras" includes two cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"This" excludes both cases under the same husband (seclusion with the same man or a different man);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"Toras" includes both cases under a different husband (seclusion with the same man or a different man).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WAVING THE <i>MINCHAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He (Rashi - the husband; Tosfos - the Kohen) takes her Minchah from the basket, and puts it in a Kli Shares. He puts the Kli in her hands; the Kohen places his hands under her hands, and waves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He waves, brings it close to the Mizbe'ach, takes a Kometz, burns the Kometz on the Mizbe'ach, and the rest is eaten by Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He gives her to drink, then offers the Minchah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon says, he offers the Minchah, then gives her to drink, like it says "after, he gives her to drink."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he gave her to drink, then offered the Minchah, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Elazar) Question:</span> What is the source that a Sotah's offering must be waved?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. It says "he will wave it"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asked, what is the source that the owner of the Minchah (the Sotah) must wave it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yoshiyah d'Darei):</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "hand-hand" with Korban Shelamim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the Kohen waves Minchas Sotah, he waves Shelamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like the owner waves Shelamim, she waves Minchas Sotah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do both wave (at the same time)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kohen puts his hands under the owner's hands, and they wave. (When the owner is a woman, a cloth separates their hands. Alternatively, the owner holds on top, and the Kohen holds underneath, without touching her hands.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE ORDER OF EVENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He waves, brings it close to the Mizbe'ach, takes a Kometz... he gives her to drink, then offers the Minchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Earlier in the Mishnah, it already said that he offers the Kometz!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah gives the order of Menachos. He waves, brings it close to the Mizbe'ach, takes a Kometz, burns the Kometz on the Mizbe'ach, and the rest is eaten by Kohanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about when she drinks. Chachamim say, she drinks, then the offering is offered;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, he offers the Minchah, then gives her to drink, like it says "after, he gives her to drink."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he gave her to drink, then offered the Minchah, it is valid.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Akiva) Question:</span> What do we learn from "v'Hishkah (he will give her to drink)" (Bamidbar 5:24, before offering the Minchah)? It 'already' says "v'Hishkah" (after it is offered, 5:27)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the scroll was erased and she refuses to drink, we force her to drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon) Question:</span> What do we learn from "after, Yashkeh (he will give her to drink)" (5:26)? It already says "v'Hishkah" (5:27)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that she drinks after all three events listed above: offering the Kometz, erasing the scroll, and accepting the oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Shimon is consistent with what he taught elsewhere, that she drinks after offering the Minchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, she drinks after erasing the scroll. She must drink water in which the scroll was erased!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He teaches that if one can see remnants of the writing, they must be erased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that she drinks after accepting the oath. This implies that the scroll may be written before she accepts, just she may not drink;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava taught that a scroll written before she accepts is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may not infer that the scroll may be written earlier. Rather, acceptance of the oath was listed even though it teaches nothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim and R. Shimon argue about (in the Mishnah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It mentions drinking three times - "v'Hishkah", "after, Yashkeh", and "v'Hishkah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim explain the first "v'Hishkah" simply. She drinks after erasing, before offering the Minchah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"After, Yashkeh", teaches that she does not drink if there remains a remnant of the writing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The last "v'Hishkah" teaches that if she refuses to drink after the scroll was erased, we force her to drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon explains "after Yashkeh" simply. She drinks after offering the Minchah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The first "v'Hishkah", teaches that if she drank before offering the Minchah, it is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>The last "v'Hishkah" teaches that if she refuses to drink after the scroll was erased, we force her to drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Chachamim disagree. They hold that the first "v'Hishkah" must discuss the proper procedure.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FORCING HER TO DRINK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In Beraisa #1, R. Akiva said that (if she refuses to drink after the scroll was erased) we force her to drink. He holds otherwise!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2 - R. Yehudah):</span> If she refuses to drink after the scroll was erased, we put iron pincers in her mouth to keep it open, to pour the water down her throat against her will;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, we do not give her to drink. Drinking is only to test her, and we know (by her refusal to drink) that she is guilty!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, before offering the Kometz, she can refuse to drink. After offering the Kometz, she cannot refuse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Beraisa #2 itself is difficult! R. Akiva says that, she cannot refuse after offering the Kometz. If she refuses to drink, we know she is guilty, so she should not drink!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We distinguish when she refuses to drink from fear, from when she is calm.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she calmly refuses to drink, we know that she is guilty, so she does not drink;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she refuses to drink from fear, if the Kometz has not yet been offered, since the scroll has not yet been erased, she may refuse;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even if the scroll was already erased, since this was a mistake, she may still refuse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the Kometz was already offered, since the scroll was erased properly, she may not refuse.</p>
