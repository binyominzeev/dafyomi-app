<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE <i>MEGILAH </i>MUST BE FOR THE <i>SOTAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If it was written on two Dapim (Tosfos - pages; Rashi - columns), it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "a Sefer", and not two or three Sefarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If he erased each letter after writing it, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "The Kohen will do this entire Torah (procedure. I.e., he must write a full scroll, then erase it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rava):</span> If a scroll was written for each of two Sotos, and they were erased into the same cup, is this valid?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If only the writing must be Lishmah (with intent for this Sotah), this was fulfilled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If also the erasing must be Lishmah, this was not fulfilled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rava):</span> If you will say that also the erasing must be Lishmah, if each scroll was erased into a different cup, and the waters were then combined, is this valid?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it suffices for the writing and erasing to be Lishmah, this was fulfilled;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps it is invalid, because each Sotah drinks part of her water and part of the other's water!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Rava):</span> If it is invalid, because each drinks part of her water and part of the other's water, if the waters were combined and then divided into two portions, is this valid?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we rely on Breirah (to say that each portion is the water originally prepared for that woman), or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Is it valid if she drank through a tube, or through a Siv (Rashi - tendrils that grow around palm trees, and it was used like a straw; Aruch - it absorbed the water, and she sucked the water from it)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is this considered the way of drinking, or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav):</span> Why are there two oaths regarding a Sotah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> One is before the scroll is erased, the other is after the scroll is erased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> The Torah mentions both oaths before the scroll is erased!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> One is an oath with a curse. The other is an oath without a curse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the oath with a curse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> 'I impose an oath on you, that you are innocent. If you were Mezanah, the water will enter you (and kill you),'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> That is not an oath with a curse. It is an oath and a curse!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> 'I impose an oath on you, that if you were Mezanah, the water...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> That is only a curse, there is no oath on her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> 'I impose an oath on you, that you are innocent, and if you were Mezanah, the water will enter you...'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS ACCEPTED IN THE OATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> She answers "Amen" twice. What else does she accept?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She accepts all of the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The curse, and also the oath;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She was not Mezanah with the man she was secluded with, nor with any other man;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>She was not Mezanah during Eirusin, after Nisu'in, (if she did Yibum,) when she was a Shomeres Yavam, or after Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>She was not Mezanah, and if she did the water should kill her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Meir says, she was not Mezanah, and she will not be Mezanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Meir and Chachamim agree that he cannot stipulate to include before Kidushin or after divorce;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she was secluded after divorce, was Mezanah, and remarried her ex-husband, he cannot stipulate to include this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The rule is, he cannot stipulate about any Bi'ah that would not forbid her to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Hamnuna):</span> If a Shomeres Yavam had Bi'ah with a stranger, she is forbidden to the Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>He learns from our Mishnah. The oath includes Znus while she was a Shomeres Yavam and after Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this only if Bi'ah with a stranger forbids a Shomeres Yavam to the Yavam. The Mishnah says that he cannot stipulate about any Bi'ah that would not forbid her to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> The Halachah does not follow Rav Hamnuna.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah supports him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Akiva, who says that Kidushin does not take effect if a Lav forbids the couple to have Bi'ah. (Therefore, a Shomeres Yavam who was Mezanah with a stranger resembles a married woman who was Mezanah, which forbids her to her husband.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ADULTERY FROM A SECOND MARRIAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Does the oath include adultery when she was previously married to him, or (if she did Yibum) during her marriage to his brother?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> The rule is, any Bi'ah that would not forbid her to him is not included in the oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Any Bi'ah that would forbid her to him is included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> She says "Amen", that I did not commit adultery...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Meir said that the second "Amen" accepts that she will not later commit adultery. He did not mean that the water will test her now (if she would have sinned had she lived). Rather, if she will sin later, the water will test her then.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> (According to R. Meir,) can he stipulate that the water should test her for adultery during a later marriage to him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since it does not forbid her now, he may not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he might divorce and remarry her and then it will forbid her, it tests her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> All agree, he cannot stipulate to include before Kidushin, nor after divorce. If she was secluded after divorce, had Bi'as Znus, and remarried her ex-husband, he cannot stipulate to include that Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He can stipulate to include Znus after she remarries him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CAN A WOMAN BE GIVEN TO DRINK TWICE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "This is Toras (the law of) warning" teaches that a woman may drink, and drink again;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, "this" teaches that she does not drink again. Nechunya the pit digger testified that a second husband may make her drink a second time, but not the same husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, a woman may not drink more than once, even if married to a second husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Why does the first Tana say that she may drink again? It says "this" (implying that she drinks only once)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Why does the last Tana say that she may not drink again? It says "Toras"! (This implies that each time she is secluded after warning, the law that she drinks applies.)</p>
