<p class="dedicationbox">12th CYCLE DEDICATION<br>SOTAH 20 (10 Sivan) - a week of study material has been dedicated by Mrs. Rita Grunberger of Queens, N.Y., in loving memory of her husband, Reb Yitzchok Yakov (Irving) ben Eliyahu Grunberger. Irving Grunberger helped many people quietly in an unassuming manner and is dearly missed by all who knew him. His Yahrzeit is 10 Sivan. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>REFUSING TO DRINK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva contradicts himself! (In Beraisa #1, he learned from the first "v'Hishkah" that she cannot refuse, even before the Kometz is offered. In Beraisa #2, he says that she can refuse if the Kometz was not yet offered!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana'im of the two Beraisos argue about R. Akiva's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she calmly refused to drink, and later she wants to drink, may she drink?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that she already established her guilt, so she may no longer drink?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since now she wants to drink, does this show that her initial refusal was due to fear?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel's father):</span> Something bitter must be put in the water, for the Torah calls it bitter, even before the scroll is erased into it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Before the scroll is erased, if she refuses to drink, the scroll is buried and the Minchah is spread on the ash-heap (where disqualified offerings are burned);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The scroll cannot be used for a different Sotah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>After the scroll is erased, if she admits that she is guilty, the water is spilled out and the Minchah is spread on the ash-heap;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she refuses to drink, we force the water down her throat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Before she finishes drinking, her face turns green, her eyes bulge, and her veins stick out. They say, 'take her out before she is Metamei the Azarah (courtyard of the Mikdash)!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If she has merits, this suspends her death. Merits can suspend for one, two or three years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Ben Azai says, a man is obligated to teach his daughter Torah, so that if she drinks, she will know that her merit is suspending her death;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Eliezer says, one who teaches his daughter Torah, teaches her Tiflus (Rambam - folly; Rashi - promiscuity);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Yehoshua says, a woman prefers one Kav of food and Tiflus, to nine Kabim and Perishus (abstention. This will be explained.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>The following destroy the world - a foolish Chasid, a crafty evildoer, a woman who is Perushah, and the afflictions of Perushim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT MAY BE USED IN INK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing R. Meir):</span> When I learned Torah from R. Akiva, I used to put vitriol in the ink. He never objected. I went to learn by R. Yishmael; I told him that I was a scribe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Be careful with your work. It is the work of Heaven! If you would omit or add a single letter, this would destroy the world!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> I put vitriol in the ink (this will be explained)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> You may not put vitriol in the ink. It says "he will erase" - the writing must be erasable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir's response does not address R. Yishmael's concern!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir full reply was 'not only am I an expert regarding missing and extra letters. I am even concerned lest a fly (rest on and) remove the ink at the extension of a Dalet, making it a Reish! To prevent this, I put vitriol in the ink.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> When I learned Torah by R. Yishmael, I used to put vitriol in the ink. He never objected. I went to learn by R. Akiva, and he forbade this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This contradicts Rav Yehudah's version of the story, both regarding whom R. Meir learned from first, and regarding who forbade vitriol!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Partial answer:</span> We can resolve the first difficulty: R. Meir first learned by R. Akiva, but was unable to understand. He went to R. Yishmael, and learned the laws. He returned to R. Akiva, and learned the reasoning behind the laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The second contradiction remains difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Yehudah):</span> Any ink may contain vitriol, except for the ink used to write Parshas Sotah;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yakov says, any ink may contain vitriol, except for that used to write Megilas Sotah in the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of their dispute (regarding Parshas Sotah in the Torah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> They argue about whether or not we may erase Parshas Sotah from a Sefer Torah into the water. R. Yehudah and R. Yakov argue like the following Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> A scroll written for a Sotah may not be used for a different Sotah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Achi bar Yoshiyah allows this (it need not be Lishmah. Therefore, we can even use a Sefer Torah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps these are different arguments!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana (of Beraisa #2) says only that a scroll written for one Sotah is invalid for a different Sotah. The Torah was not written for any particular Sotah. Perhaps it may be used for any Sotah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Achi allows using a scroll written for one Sotah for a different Sotah, since it was written to be curses. The Torah was written to learn from, not to be a curse. Perhaps it may not be used for a Sotah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Achi argue with a Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven wrote a Get for his wife, then decided not to divorce her, and he found another Reuven in his city, and their wives' names were also the same, the second Reuven cannot use the Get to divorce his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Achi can agree to the Mishnah. It says about divorce "he will write for her" - the Get must written for her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It also says about Sotah "he will do for her"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to erasing the scroll, not writing it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW THE WATER TESTS HER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Before she finishes drinking, her face...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Mishnah is like R. Shimon, who says that she drinks after offering the Minchah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"A Minchah of commemoration, that mentions sin" - the water does not test her until the Minchah is offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reisha):</span> If she has merits, it suspends her death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Chachamim. R. Shimon says that merit does not suspend her death!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva holds that she drinks after offering the Minchah, and that merits suspend her death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They say 'take her out...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must they take her out?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Perhaps she will die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It is forbidden to have a Mes (corpse) in the Ezras Nashim (the place in the Mikdash where she drinks).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa):</span> A (person or Kli that is) Tamei Mes may enter the Levite camp (it has the same Kedushah as the Ezras Nashim);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even a Mes may be brought in. "Moshe took Yosef's bones with him" - in his residence!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Rather, we are concerned lest she become Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that fright induces menstrual blood to come out!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Rav expounded "va'Tischalchal ha'Malkah" to teach that Esther became a Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Fear inhibits the flow of menstrual blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Prolonged fear inhibits the flow. Sudden terror induces it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MERIT SUSPENDS PUNISHMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she has merit...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah is unlike all the following Tana'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Yosi ben Chanan):</span> Merit suspends her death three months, the time necessary for pregnancy to show;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer ben Yitzchak says, it suspends nine months, like the term of pregnancy;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(Regarding an innocent woman) it says "she will be vindicated, and have Zera (seed, i.e. children);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We learn from "seed that serves Hash-m will tell" - seed that (was born after nine months and) is fit to tell Hash-m's praise.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yishmael says, it suspends 12 months. There is not a proof for this, but verses hints to this;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(Daniel told Nevuchadnetzar) "redeem your sin with Tzedakah... your serenity will be prolonged."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>His punishment came "after 12 months."</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
