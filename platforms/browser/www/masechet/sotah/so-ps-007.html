<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TAKING HER TO YERUSHALAYIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (After warning and seclusion), the husband takes his wife to the local Beis Din. They send two Chachamim to accompany them on the way to Yerushalayim, lest he have Bi'ah with her on the way (which is forbidden, and would prevent the water from testing her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, this is not needed. He is trusted not to have Bi'ah with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Including the husband, there are three men in all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This supports Rav Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Two men may be secluded with a woman only in town. On the road, three men are required.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If there were only two, if one needs to relieve himself, the other will be secluded with her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. We send two with them so they can testify (if he has Bi'ah with her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Mishnah says that Chachamim must accompany them. We may not send commoners.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This supports another teaching of Rav Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Two men may be secluded with a woman only if they are proper. If they are lewd, even 10 men may not be secluded with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A case occurred in which 10 men took a woman out in a coffin to have Bi'ah with her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. We send Chachamim so they can warn him (that if he has Bi'ah with her, the water will not test her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> This is not needed. Her husband (is trusted...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A Kal va'Chomer shows that the husband is trusted:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nidah is Chayavei Kerisus, yet a man is trusted to be secluded with his wife when she is Nidah. Sotah is only a Lav, all the more so he is trusted to be alone with her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Chachamim hold that he is trusted with a Nidah only because the punishment is severe. Sotah is light in his eyes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> In this Beraisa, R. Yehudah learned from a Kal va'Chomer. Elsewhere, he learns this from a verse!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He will bring his wife to the Kohen" - the Torah trusts a man to bring his wife alone, but Chachamim enacted that two Chachamim accompany them, lest they have Bi'ah on the way;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, a Kal va'Chomer shows that he husband is trusted:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A man may be secluded with his wife when she is Nidah, which has Kares. Sotah is only a Lav, all the more so he is trusted to be alone with her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No. He is trusted with a Nidah, since she will again become permitted to him. A Sotah might never become permitted! Also, "stolen waters (i.e. Aveiros) are sweet."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehudah says, the Torah trusts a man to bring his wife alone - "he will bring his wife."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> First, R. Yehudah said the Kal va'Chomer. After Chachamim rejected it, he brought a proof from the verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah agrees with the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana holds that mid'Rabanan, two Chachamim must accompany them. R. Yehudah disagrees.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BEFORE SHE DRINKS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They take her to the great Beis Din in Yerushalayim and intimidate her, like we threaten witnesses in capital cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They say to her 'wine, frivolity, youth and bad neighbors can cause many things. Admit for the sake of Hash-m's great name, so it will not need to be erased.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They say to her things not fit for her and her family to hear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she confesses, she writes a receipt for her Kesuvah (i.e. that she is not entitled to it) and leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If she says that she is Tehorah, they take her to the east gate (of Har ha'Bayis), and then to the Nikanor Gate.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>That is where Sotos drink, and where we are Metaher women who gave birth and Metzora'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Kohen grabs her garments. We are not concerned if they tear at the seams or in the garment itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>He reveals her heart and unbraids her hair;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah says, if her heart or hair is attractive, he does not reveal or unbraid it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If she was dressed in white clothing, she must change to black clothing. If she was wearing gold jewelry, necklaces and rings, we remove them, to disgrace her.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>A Mitzri rope is tied above her breasts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Anyone who wants to see her is permitted, except for her slaves, because she is unlikely to admit in front of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All women are allowed to see her - "all the women will be chastised, and will not do like her harlotry."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that the great Beis Din is required?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Gamda):</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Torah-Torah".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says about a Sotah "the Kohen will do this Torah (procedure) to her", like it says about a Chacham who opposes the Sanhedrin, "according to the Torah that they will teach you."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like there, he must oppose the Beis Din of 71, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We intimidate her...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Just like we intimidate her not to drink, we intimidate her to drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We tell her 'if you know that you are innocent, drink! The water is like a dry salve placed on raw skin. It will not do anything'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Before the scroll is erased, we intimidate her so she will not drink. After it is erased, we intimidate her so she will drink.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE GREATNESS OF CONFESSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We tell her about Tzadikim in the Torah who confessed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yehudah confessed (about Tamar), he was not ashamed. In the end, he inherited life in the world to come. The same applies to Reuven (he confessed to moving Yakov's bed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was their reward?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Beraisa said that they inherited the world to come!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We ask what reward they received in this world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "To them alone was given Eretz Yisrael; a stranger did not come between them." (Rashi - Yehudah received kingship, and Reuven was the first Shevet to get a share of Eretz Yisrael. Tosfos - in the future division of Eretz Yisrael, they will be neighbors - Yechezkel 48:7.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Yehudah's admission is explicit - "Yehudah recognized the signs, and said 'she is more righteous than me.'"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that Reuven admitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "Reuven will live and not die. And this is to Yehudah" - all the years in the wilderness, Yehudah's bones were rolling in his coffin, until Moshe asked Hash-m to have mercy on him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> Yehudah caused Reuven to admit. (Is it proper that Reuven is intact,) "and this is to Yehudah" (that his bones are rolling)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Moshe continued:</span> "Hear, Hash-m, the voice of Yehudah" - his bones came together, but he was denied entrance to the Yeshiva in Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Bring him to his nation" - he was allowed in, but he could not understand the arguments.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"His hands are great for him" - he could understand, but he could not reach the correct law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"He will have help from his adversaries" (he reached the correct Halachah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Yehudah admitted so that Tamar would not be burned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why did Reuven admit?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was so his brothers would not be suspected.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>IF SHE ADMITS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she says that she is Temei'ah (she gives her husband a receipt for the Kesuvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This shows that a borrower must accept a receipt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Abaye):</span> No. The Mishnah should say 'she tears her Kesuvah.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Do not change the Mishnah. It says that she writes a receipt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, the Mishnah discusses a place where Kesuvos are not written. (All agree that when there is no alternative, we write a receipt.)</p>
