<p class="dedicationbox">12th CYCLE DEDICATION<br>SOTAH 23-25 - A week of study material has been dedicated by Mrs. Rita Grunberger of Queens, N.Y., in loving memory of her husband, Reb Yitzchok Yakov (Irving) ben Eliyahu Grunberger. Irving Grunberger helped many people quietly in an unassuming manner and is dearly missed by all who knew him. His Yahrzeit is 10 Sivan. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DISQUALIFIED MENACHOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> The Minchah is burned in the following cases: she admitted her guilt; witnesses of her guilt came; she refuses to drink; her husband does not want her to drink; her husband had Bi'ah with her after the seclusion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If her husband is a Kohen, her Minchah is burned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Any Minchah of a Bas Yisrael married to a Kohen is (totally) burned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Any Minchah of a Bas Kohen married to a Yisrael is eaten (except for the Kometz).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What differences are there between a (male) Kohen and a Bas Kohen?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Bas Kohen's Minchah is eaten. A Kohen's Minchah is not eaten;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Bas Kohen becomes disqualified to Kehunah through forbidden Bi'ah. A Kohen does not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Bas Kohen may become Tamei Mes. A Kohen may not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Kohen may eat Kodshei Kodoshim (the Korbanos with the greatest Kedushah). A Bas Kohen may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What differences are there between a man and a woman?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A male Metzora does Pri'ah (Tana'im argue if this means to let his hair grow, or to bare his head) and tears his clothes. A female Metzora does not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A man can impose Nezirus on his son. A woman cannot;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A (male) Nazir can bring Korbanos (when he completes Nezirus) from money that his deceased father set aside for his own Nezirus. A Nezirah cannot;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A man can Mekadesh his daughter to a man. A woman cannot Mekadesh her daughter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A man can sell his daughter to be a slave. A woman cannot sell her daughter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>A man (liable to be stoned) is stoned naked. A woman is not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>(In some cases, after stoning) a man is hanged. A woman is not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>(In some cases) a man is sold to be a slave to pay for his theft. A woman is not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>MINCHAH</i> OF A <i>KOHEN'S </i>WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> The Minchah (voluntary, or of a Sotah) of a Kohen's wife is burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Whether her father is a Kohen, Levi, or Yisrael, her Minchah cannot be eaten since her husband has a share in it. We cannot burn the entire Minchah (intact) on the Mizbe'ach, because she has a share in it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, the Kometz is offered, and the rest is offered by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If something is partially offered on the Mizbe'ach, a Lav (Lo Saktiru) forbids burning the remainder!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Yehudah, son of R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> The remainder is offered as if it were wood, like R. Eliezer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> You may not offer (the remainder) for a pleasing scent (i.e. a Korban), but you may offer it like wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is a valid answer according to R. Eliezer. According to Chachamim who argue with R. Eliezer, what is done with the remainder?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (We burn it on the ash heap), like R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> The Kometz is offered by itself, and the rest is burned on the ash heap.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even Chachamim who argue about R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Shimon, argue only about Minchas Chotei of a Kohen, since they hold that it is offered intact (without removing a Kometz). They agree about the Minchah of a Kohen's wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Bas Yisrael... (any Minchah of a Bas Kohen married to a Yisrael is eaten).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "every Minchah of a Kohen is entirely burned, it may not be eaten." This applies to a (male) Kohen, not to a Kohenes.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Bas Kohen becomes disqualified to Kehunah through forbidden Bi'ah. A Kohen does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will not profane his seed" - a Kohen profanes his seed, but not himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Bas Kohen may become Tamei Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "say to the Kohanim, the sons of Aharon", not the daughters of Aharon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Kohen may eat Kodshei Kodoshim...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from "every male among the children of Aharon will eat it."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> What differences are there between a man and a woman? (A male Metzora does Pri'ah...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "a man" teaches that only a male Metzora can become a Muchlat (totally Tamei)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "The Metzora who has..." is extra. It includes a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "A man"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that the subsequent laws of Pri'ah and tearing clothes apply only to a man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man can impose Nezirus on his son. A woman cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is a tradition from Sinai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Nazir can bring Korbanos from his father's money - a Nezirah cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is a tradition from Sinai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man can Mekadesh his daughter to a man. A woman cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from "I gave my daughter to this man." (This is said by the father of a Kalah when the Chasan claims that she was not a virgin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man can sell his daughter to be a slave. A woman cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from "if a man will sell his daughter."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man is stoned naked. A woman is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "They will stone him."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A woman is not stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You will take out the man or the woman (to be stoned)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, a man is stoned (alone, i.e.) without his clothes. A woman is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man is hanged...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "You will hang him on a tree", but not a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man is sold to pay for his theft. A woman is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will be sold for his theft", not for her theft.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK ARUSAH</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WOMEN WHO DO NOT DRINK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An Arusah (a wife between Kidushin and Nisu'in) or a Shomeres Yavam (she is awaiting Yibum) does not drink or receive a Kesuvah. "Under her husband" excludes them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The following do not drink or receive a Kesuvah - a widow married to a Kohen Gadol, a divorcee or Chalutzah (one who did Chalitzah) married to a regular Kohen, a Mamzeres (one who descends from Arayos, i.e. incestuous relationships forbidden by Kares) or Nesinah (one of the seven Kena'ani nations) married to a Yisrael, or a Bas Yisrael married to a Mamzer or Nasin.</p>
