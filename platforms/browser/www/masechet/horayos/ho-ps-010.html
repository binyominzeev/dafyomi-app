<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO WAS DEMOTED (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If the Kohen brings a Par for sinning after he was demoted, surely he brings a Par for sinning before he was demoted! (Why must the Mishnah teach this?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If a Nasi sinned after he was demoted, he is like a commoner. Both cases of Nasi had to be taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since both cases were taught regarding a Nasi, they were both taught regarding a Mashu'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "(A Mashu'ach) will offer for his sin" - he brings his Chatas (a par) after he is demoted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought to learn from a Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Nasi is liable for sinning b'Shogeg, yet he is exempt [from his special Korban, i.e. a Sa'ir] after he is deposed. A Mashu'ach is exempt for Shogeg (without Hora'ah), and all the more so he is exempt [from a Par] after he is demoted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The verse teaches that he is liable [a Par] after he is demoted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that a Nasi is liable a Sa'ir after he is deposed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Mashu'ach is exempt for Shogeg (alone, without Hora'ah), yet he is liable [a Par] after he is demoted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Nasi is liable for Shogeg, and all the more so he should be liable [a Sa'ir] after he is deposed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> " That a Nasi will sin" - he is liable like a Nasi if and only if he sinned when he was Nasi, but not after he is demoted. (Then, he brings like a commoner.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that he is liable after he is demoted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO WAS PROMOTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a commoner sinned, then he was appointed to be Kohen Gadol or Nasi, he brings like a commoner;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon says, this is if he found out that he sinned before he was appointed. If he found out afterwards, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Nasi is the king. "Hash-m Elokav" teaches that only Hash-m is above him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "If the Mashu'ach will sin (he brings a Par)", but not for sins before he was appointed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Nasi is liable for Shogeg, yet he does not bring the Korban of a Nasi for sins before he was appointed. A Mashu'ach is liable only for Shogeg due to Hora'ah, and all the more so does not bring the Korban of a Mashu'ach for prior sins!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from a Nasi, for he does not bring his special Korban after he is deposed, but a Mashu'ach brings his special Korban after he is demoted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, we need "if the Mashu'ach will sin." If he sinned when he was as a Mashu'ach, he brings. If he sinned when he was a regular Kohen, he does not bring.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "That a Nasi will sin (he brings a Sa'ir)", but not for sins before he was appointed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should know this from a Kal va'Chomer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Mashu'ach brings his special Korban after he is demoted, yet he does not bring it for sins before he was appointed. A Nasi does not bring his special Korban after he is deposed, and all the more so does not bring it for prior sins!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from a Mashu'ach, for he is exempt for Shogeg!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, we need "that a Nasi will sin." If he sinned when he was Nasi (he brings the Korban of a Nasi), and not if he sinned when he was a commoner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> "That a Nasi will sin" - perhaps it is decreed that he will sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "<i>if</i> the Mashu'ach will sin." Likewise, the Torah teaches what a Nasi brings <i>if</i> he will sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need a verse? How could we have thought that it is decreed that he will sin?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We find that the Torah gives bad tidings;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yehudah says "(Hash-m) will put Tzara'as in a house" informs Yisrael that Tzara'as will come upon them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Shimon says, this excludes a case of Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Shimon really hold that Tzara'as of Ones is not Tamei?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "A man who will see a Tzara'as in his skin" discusses (a plague that arose) after the Torah was given.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can learn this from Zivah. Just like Zivah applies only after the Torah was given, also Tzara'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from a Zav, for he does not become Tamei through Ones, but Tzara'as through Ones is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Therefore, the verse is needed. <span class="note">(<span class="notewd">Note:</span> a Stam Sifra (Beraisa that expounds verses in Vayikra) is assumed to be R. Yehudah (Kidushin 53a). We must say that the logic of this Beraisa is solid. R. Shimon must agree that Tzara'as b'Ones is Tamei, for if not he could not explain why the verse is needed.)</span></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> R. Shimon holds that Tzara'as (of Ones) caused by Shedim is not Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> R. Shimon holds that Tzara'as due to witchcraft is not Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "That a Nasi will sin" excludes if he is sick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if he is sick, he is still Nasi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Avdimi bar Chama):</span> It excludes if he became a Metzora.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"... The king was a Metzora... he sat in the house of freedom" implies that before this, he was a slave!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A leader is like a slave. The following shows this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Raban Gamliel and R. Yehoshua were on a boat. Raban Gamliel's supply of bread ran out. R. Yehoshua, who had brought flour (for after the bread will run out), shared with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel:</span> How did you know that we might be delayed so much, to take flour?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> There is a star that rises once every 70 years and deceives sailors. I was concerned for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel:</span> You are such a Chacham! Must you go on boats to support yourself?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> R. Eliezer Chisma and R. Yochanan ben Gudgoda can calculate how many drops are in the ocean, and they lack food and clothing!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Raban Gamliel decided to appoint them to be leaders, to correct this. When he arrived, he called for them. They did not come until he called for them a second time.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel:</span> Were you reluctant to come because you thought I want to give to you authority? I give to you slavery - "if from this day, you (Rechav'om ha'Melech) will be a slave to this nation..."</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>REWARD AND PUNISHMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yochanan ben Zakai):</span> "<i>Asher</i> Nasi Yecheta" - Ashrei (fortunate) is the generation whose Nasi brings a Korban when he was Shogeg;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Nasi brings for Shogeg (even though it is shameful for him), all the more so a commoner will!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he seeks atonement for Shogeg, all the more he will repent if he was Mezid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava brei d'Rabah):</span> If so, "<i>Asher</i> he misappropriated from Hekdesh" and "<i>Asher</i> (Yarovom) sinned and made sin" should also be reasons for the generation to rejoice!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We expound Asher regarding a Nasi, for the Torah used a different word (than it used regarding a Mashu'ach and commoner).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> How do we explain "there is a folly done on the land (Hash-m deals with some Tzadikim like is proper for Resha'im, and with intent Resha'im like is proper for Tzadikim)"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> Tzadikim are fortunate. They are punished (to cleanse them from their sins) in this world (where the punishments are much lighter) like is proper for Resha'im in the world to come;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Woe to Resha'im! They receive all the reward for threir Mitzvos in this world, whereas Tzadikim get (infinitely greater) reward in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Why shouldn't a Tzadik be rewarded in both worlds?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Tzadikim are fortunate! They get reward (in addition to reward in the world to come) in this world, like Resha'im get (all their reward) in this world;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Woe to Resha'im, they are punished (also) in this world, like Tzadikim get (all their) punishments in this world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rava heard that Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehishua had learned certain tractates and became rich.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Tzadikim are fortunate! They get reward (even in this world), like Resha'im get (all their reward) in this world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> How do we explain "the ways of Hash-m are straight. Tzadikim will go in them, and Resha'im will stumble in them"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> A parable explains this. There were two men. One ate his Korban Pesach for the sake of the Mitzvah, and the other stuffed himself and ate it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Tzadikim will go in them" applies to the first man. "Resha'im will stumble in them" applies to the latter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Reish Lakish):</span> Why do you call the latter a Rasha? Granted, he didn't do the Mitzvah ideally, but he did fulfill it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> Rather, the following parable explains this. There were two men. Each was in a house with his wife and his sister. One chanced upon his wife (and had relations with her), and the other chanced upon his sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Tzadikim will go in them" applies to the first man. "Resha'im will stumble in them" applies to the latter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The verse discusses men going on the same path. In the parable, they are in different paths! (One did a Mitzvah, and the other sinned.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, an example is Lot and his two daughters (with whom he had Bi'ah (relations)). They intended for a Mitzvah. They are Tzidkaniyos walking in Hash-m's ways. Lot intended to sin. He is a Rasha stumbling in Hash-m's ways.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps also Lot intended for a Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> An entire verse connects Lot to sexual immorality.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lot lifted (his eyes)" - just like Potifar's wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"His eyes" - just like Shimshon's first wife was pleasing in his eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"He saw" - just like Shechem saw Dinah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"The whole Kikar (plain) of the Yarden" - just like "for a harlot, a Kikar (loaf) of bread";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"It is all Mashkeh (fertile)" - just like "I will follow my lovers, who give... and Shikuyai (my drinks)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Lot was drunk (and unaware of what happened)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Rav Choni):</span> The 'Vov' in "and when he rose (after sleeping with the older daughter)" is dotted, to show that he did not know when he went to lie with her, but he knew when he got up.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The incest already happened. Why is Lot blamed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should not have gotten drunk the next night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "A brother cut himself off from a city of strength" refers to Lot, who separated from Avraham;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"And quarrels like a bolt on a fortress" - he instigated quarrels (that keep him out) like a bolted fortress -"an Amoni or Mo'avi will not marry into the congregation of Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "One who seeks lust will be isolated" refers to Lot;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"And in all salvation he will be exposed" - his disgrace is revealed in Batei Kenesiyos (when they read the above verse of the Torah forbidding his descendants) and Batei Medrash (when they learn the following Mishnah).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Isur of an Amoni or Moavi is forever.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A SIN WITH GOOD INTENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Tamar and Zimri both had Bi'as Zenus (outside of marriage). Kings and prophets descended from Tamar's act. Many tens of thousands of Yisrael died as a result of Zimri's act.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> A sin done with pure intent (i.e. for Hash-m's sake) is better than a Mitzvah with impure intent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> (This implies that a Mitzvah with impure intent is bad.) Rav Yehudah taught that one should always engage in Torah and Mitzvos, even with impure intent, for this will lead him to do them with pure intent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, a sin done with pure intent is as good as a Mitzvah with impure intent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nachman learns from "Ya'el, the wife of Chever the Kini, will be blessed like women in the tent."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The women in the tent are Sarah, Rivkah, Rachel and Leah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Sisera had relations with Ya'el seven times - "between her legs he bent, he fell, he lied... "</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ya'el enjoyed the sin! (Why is she praised for it?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She did not enjoy it. Benefit that Tzadikim get from Resha'im is bad for Tzadikim. Hash-m told Lavan "beware not to speak to Yakov good nor evil."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, he should not speak evil. Why shouldn't he speak nicely to him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The good of Resha'im is bad for Tzadikim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One should always engage in Torah and Mitzvos, even with impure intent, for this will lead him to do them with pure intent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Balak offered 42 Korbanos (to try to entice Hash-m to let Bilam curse Yisrael). Due to this, he merited that Rus descended from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> Rus was the granddaughter of Eglon, king of Moav.</p>
