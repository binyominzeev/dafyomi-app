<p class=newsubafdaf><span class=numt>1)</span> GATES AND WALLS OF <i>HAR HA'BAYIS</i></p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 3):</span> Inside (the wall of) Har ha'Bayis was the Soreg. It was a fence ten Tefachim tall;</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	The kings of Yavan made 13 breaches in it. Yisrael fixed them, and enacted to bow at those 13 places.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span>	Inside the Soreg was the Cheil, (a space of) ten Amos;</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span>	There were 12 steps from the Cheil (up to Ezras Nashim). Each step was a half-Amah wide and a half-Amah tall.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span>	All the steps (in Har ha'Bayis) were like this, except for those in front of the Ulam (Mishnah 3:6);</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span>	All the openings and gates (in Har ha'Bayis) were 20 Amos tall and 10 Amos wide, except for that of the Ulam (Mishnah 3:7);</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(g)</span>	All the openings had doors, except for that of the Ulam;</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(h)</span>	All the gates had a (horizontal) lintel on top, except for Tadi, which was covered by two rocks, leaning diagonally on each other (like an (inverted) V-shaped roof. Gra - this reminded people not to use it, to spare Ba'alei Keri, who left through there, from shame.)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(i)</span>	(Bnei Yisrael were poor when they built Bayis Sheni.) Later, (after they became richer,) all the gates were covered with gold, except for Nikanor, since a miracle was done for it;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	Some say this was because its copper shined (alternatively - resembled gold).</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(j)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 4):</span> All the walls (in Har ha'Bayis) were tall, except for the eastern wall, for the Kohen who burns Parah Adumah stands on Har ha'Mishchah, and he must be able to see the opening of the Heichal when sprinkling its blood.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(k)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 5):</span> Ezras Nashim was 135 Amos by 135 Amos. In each of the four corners was a Lishkah, 40 Amos by 40 Amos:</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	They did not have ceilings. They will also be this way in the future -- "... ha'Chatzer ha'Chitzonah;... Chatzeros Keturos;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	"Keturos" means that they do not have a ceiling.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(l)</span>	Question: What were they used for?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(m)</span>	Answer: The southeast corner was Lishkas ha'Nezirim; where Nezirim cooked the Shelamim, shaved their heads and put the hair under the pot;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	The northeast corner was Lishkas ha'Etzim. There, blemished Kohanim check wood;</p>
<p class=thirdindent><span class=numl3>i.</span>	(Moist) wormy wood may not be used for the Mizbe'ach. (If it is dry, the bad area is scraped away and the wood is valid.)</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	The northwest corner was Lishkas Metzora'im. (A Metzora who had immersed on day seven would go to this Lishkah on day eight, immerse again, and wait there until the blood of his Asham was ready to be put on him);</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>3.</span><span class=desl2>	R. Eliezer ben Yakov:</span> I forgot the usage of the southwest corner.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>4.</span>	Aba Shaul says, it was Lishkas ha'Shemanim, wine and oil were stored there.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(n)</span><span class=desl1>	Version #1 (Rosh):</span> At first, the walls of Ezras Nashim were smooth. (There was no ceiling. During Simchas Beis ha'Sho'evah, women were inside and men outside, this led to lightheadedness);</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(o)</span><span class=desl1>	Version #2 (Rambam):</span> At first, Ezras Nashim did not have walls; (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	They extended ledges from the walls and built a roof (Rambam - they built walls), so women could (sit there and) see from above, and the men would be below, without mixing together.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(p)</span>	There were 15 steps from Ezras Nashim up to Ezras Yisrael, corresponding to the 15 chapters of Shir ha'Ma'alos in Tehilim;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	The Leviyim sing on these steps (during Simchas Beis ha'Sho'evah), they were not long and rectangular, rather, semicircles.</p>
<p class=bbbline>35b----------------------------------------35b</p>
<p class=newsubafbbb><span class=numt>2)</span> THE LAYOUT OF THE <i>AZARAH</i></p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 6):</span> There were Lishkos underneath Ezras Yisrael which opened to Ezras Nashim. The Leviyim kept their instruments there;</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	Ezras Yisrael was 135 Amos long and 11 Amos wide. Ezras Kohanim was the same. The ends of beams demarcated the border between them.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span>	R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, there was a step (between these Azaros) an Amah tall. The Duchan (on which the Leviyah sing) was on it. (Bartenura - the step is part of Ezras Yisrael. Rosh - it is part of Ezras Kohanim);</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	In it (the Duchan; Rashash - Ezras Kohanim) there were three half-Amah steps. In all, Ezras Kohanim was two and a half Amos above Ezras Yisrael.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span>	The entire Azarah (including Ezras Yisrael and Ezras Kohanim) was 187 Amos long and 135 Amos wide.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span>	There were 13 places where it was enacted to bow;</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span>	Aba Yosi ben Chanan says, these correspond to the 13 gates (of the Azarah. The Tana of Mishnah 2:3 attributes them to the 13 breaches made by the kings of Yavan. He could hold like Mishnah 1:4, which counts only seven gates of the Azarah. Aba Yosi counts six more gates, and calls some of the seven by different names.)</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	In the south, starting from the west, were Sha'ar ha'Elyon, Sha'ar ha'Delek, Sha'ar ha'Bechoros (Mishnah 1:4 called this Sha'ar ha'Korban) and Sha'ar ha'Mayim.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span><span class=desl2>	Question:</span> Why was it called Sha'ar ha'Mayim?</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>3.</span><span class=desl2>	Answer #1:</span> The flask of water for Nisuch ha'Mayim on Sukos was brought through it.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>4.</span><span class=desl2>	Answer #2 (R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> This is the place of Mayim Mefakim. (Yechezkel 47:2 discusses a miniscule spring that comes out from the Kodesh ha'Kodashim. It keeps widening. when it reaches this Sha'ar, it is as wide as the mouth of a Pach (jar).)</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>5.</span>	In the north, starting from the west, were Sha'ar Yechanyah, Sha'ar ha'Korban, Sha'ar ha'Nashim (where women enter to perform Semichah to their Korbanos, or to be present while their Korban is being offered) and Sha'ar ha'Shir.</p>
<p class=thirdindent><span class=numl3>i.</span>	The first was called Sha'ar Yechanyah because Yechanyah left through it when he was exiled (with 1000 great Chachamim, 11 years before the first Churban).</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>6.</span>	In the east was Sha'ar Nikanor. It had two small openings, one to the right and one to the left;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>7.</span>	There were two gates in the west without names.</p>
<p class=perekline>PEREK HA'MIZBE'ACH</p>
<p class=newsubject><span class=numt>3)</span> THE SIZE OF THE <i>MIZBE'ACH</i></p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah):</span> The (base of the) Mizbe'ach was 32 Amos by 32 Amos. The base was one Amah tall. The Mizbe'ach was recessed one Amah (in each direction), so the Mizbe'ach above the base was 30 by 30;</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	Above the base, the Mizbe'ach rose five Amos until the Sovev, then it recessed one Amah. The Mizbe'ach above the Sovev was 28 by 28;</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span>	Each corner was one Amah square. The Mizbe'ach within the corners was 26 by 26;</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span>	The walkway on top of the Mizbe'ach (within the corners) was one Amah in each direction. The Ma'arachah was 24 by 24.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span>	When the exiles returned (with Ezra, to build the second Beis ha'Mikdash), they added four Amos onto the Mizbe'ach on the south side, and four Amos on the west side -- the addition was an "L" shape -- "veha'Ari'el (the Mizbe'ach of the first Beis ha'Mikdash) Shteim Esreh Orech bi'Shteim Esreh Rochav Ravu'a."</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span><span class=desl2>	Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it was (in all) 12 Amos by 12 Amos!</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span><span class=desl2>	Rejection:</span> It says "El Arba'as Reva'av" -- it was 12 Amos in every direction from the middle.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span>	Chut ha'Sikra (a red line) girds the Mizbe'ach in the middle, to distinguish between (the place for) upper and lower blood.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(g)</span>	The Yesod went across the entire northern and western sides. It occupied one Amah on the southern and eastern sides.</p>
