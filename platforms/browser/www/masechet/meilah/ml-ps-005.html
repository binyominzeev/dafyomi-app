<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS <i>SHE'AS HETER</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Bar Pedas):</span> Does he refer to Heter Shechitah (the Heter created by Shechitah), or Heter Zerikah (the Heter created by Kabalas ha'Dam, making it possible to do Zerikah), or Heter Achilah (the act of Zerikah, which makes it permitted to eat the Korban)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Bar Kapara:</span> Chizkiyah and R. Yochanan argue about this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> He refers to Heter Shechitah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> He refers to Heter Achilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> The inference of our Mishnah is unlike both of them (and the Mishnah directly refutes R. Yochanan! The Gemara answers only for R. Yochanan).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following had She'as Heter -- it was Lan (left overnight), became Tamei, or was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "Lan" means that the blood was left overnight. There was Heter Zerikah (Kabalah was performed), but no Heter to eat (Zerikah was not performed. This implies that Heter Shechitah is not enough to remove Me'ilah, unlike Chizkiyah, and Zerikah is not necessary to remove it, unlike Rebbi Yochanan!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the <i>meat</i> was left overnight. Valid Zerikah was done. Therefore, there is no Me'ilah. (There was Heter Achilah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The following never had She'as Heter -- it was slaughtered Chutz li'Zemano or Chutz li'Mekomo, or Pesulim did Kabalah and they did Zerikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the (last) case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Pesulim did Kabalah and also Zerikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why must we say that Pesulim did both? The Korban is already Pasul from their Kabalah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Pesulim did Kabalah, and Kesherim did Zerikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> In such a case there is Me'ilah (but if Kesherim did Kabalah, even if Pesulim did Zerikah, there is no Me'ilah, for there was Heter Zerikah). This shows that he refers to Heter Zerikah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef, for R. Yochanan):</span> If this inference is valid, it should also apply to the Mishnah of Kibus (laundering)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> If blood of a Pasul Chatas spurted onto a garment, Kibus is not required, whether or not it had She'as ha'Kosher;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The following Chata'os had She'as ha'Kosher and became Pesulim -- the blood became Pasul due to Linah, Tum'ah or Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The following Chata'os never had She'as ha'Kosher -- it was slaughtered Chutz li'Zemano or Chutz li'Mekomo, or Pesulim did Kabalah and (they did) Zerikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the (last) case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Pesulim did Kabalah and also Zerikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This implies that had Kesherim done Zerikah, Kibus would be required. However, "va'Asher <i>Yizeh</i> mi'Damah," teaches that Kivus is not needed for blood that was already thrown (even for a valid Chatas)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Mishnah #1 is imprecise. (The same applies if Kesherim did Zerikah.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Summation of Answer (f):</span> Likewise, our Mishnah is imprecise. (Even if Kesherim did Kabalah, if Pesulim did Zerikah, there is Me'ilah, because) we require a Heter to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Asi):</span> It is unreasonable that the clause was taught in two places, and is not precise in either! (Tosfos - if our Mishnah is precise, it is reasonable that Mishnah #1 uses the same words, even though it is not precise.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Asi):</span> Really, our Mishnah is precise. (If Kesherim did Kabalah, Me'ilah would not apply. Heter Zerikah is required);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi, and somewhat more clear in Perush Kadmon (A)):</span> (Even though also Zerikas Kesherim is exempt from Kibus,) Mishnah #1 mentions Kabalas and Zerikas Pesulim to teach that a Pasul's act of Kabalah and Zerikah makes the other blood Shirayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> Our Mishnah mentions Zerikas Pesulim to teach that a Pasul makes Shirayim; (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even if there is more Dam ha'Nefesh in the animal, Kabalas and Zerikah by a valid Kohen will not accomplish anything (Rashi - Kibus does not apply; Tosfos - it cannot be Machshir the Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught differently!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If a Pasul did Zerikah, does he cause the remaining blood to be Shirayim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The only Pesulim that make Shirayim are Chutz li'Zemano (and Chutz li'Mekomo), since it is Meratzeh for Pigul (like a proper Zerikah. Chutz li'Mekomo is equated to Chutz li'Zemano).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> (Any other) Pasul [who did Avodah without improper intent] does not make Shirayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, (even) a Pasul makes Shirayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan said "the <i>only</i> Pesulim... "!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, the only Pesulim that are not Meratzeh (valid for Avodah) b'Tzibur that make Shirayim are Chutz li'Zemano and Chutz li'Mekomo;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Teme'im, who are Meratzeh b'Tzibur (l'Chatchilah, if there are no Tehorim) also make Shirayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Other Pesulim, who are never Meratzeh b'Tzibur, do not make Shirayim. (We conclude that when Rav Asi said that a Pasul's act of Kabalah and Zerikah makes the remaining blood Shirayim, he referred to the Pesul of a Tamei Kohen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Me'ilah always applies to Pigul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to before (Tosfos (DH u'Mai) - or after) Zerikah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Before Zerikah, Kabalas Pigul is not considered as if it was thrown, but Kabalas Kosher is as if it was thrown) This shows that Heter Zerikah is required! (Tosfos - after Zerikah, it teaches that Zerikas Pigul does not uproot Me'ilah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is (Tosfos - only) after Zerikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "Me'ilah <i>always</i> applies"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches Rav Gidal's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> Zerikas Pigul does not remove Me'ilah from Kodshei Kodashim, and it does not cause Me'ilah to apply to Kodshim Kalim.</p>
