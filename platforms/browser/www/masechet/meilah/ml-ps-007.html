<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Intent (for Pigul) takes effect on what was lost or burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though they are not present, intent takes effect on them (our text: as if they are present. All the more so Zerikah should take effect on Yotzei, since it is present).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Asi contradicts what he himself taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Asi):</span> Does intent Chutz li'Zemano take effect on "Nishpachim"? (Rashi - while pouring Shirayim on the Yesod he intended to eat meat Chutz li'Zemano; alternatively, during a previous Avodah he intended to pour Shirayim on the Yesod Chutz li'Zemano; Tosfos - he intended to collect blood that spilled from the bucket and sprinkle it Chutz li'Zemano.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Tosfos) Answer (R. Zeira):</span> You yourself taught us about Alal (the hard sinew of the neck);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Pigul does not take effect on it because it is unimportant. Likewise, intent should not take effect on Nishpachim, for it is unimportant (there is no obligation to collect it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi) Answer (R. Zeira):</span> You yourself taught us Alal (it joins with meat to comprise a Shi'ur for Tum'as Ochlim, but not to comprise a k'Zayis for Tum'as Nevelah);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It does not join for Tum'as Nevelah because it is unimportant. Likewise, intent should not take effect on Nishpachim, for (proper) Zerikah is not done with them! (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of Objection:</span> Here (a), Rav Ashi says that intent takes effect on what was lost or burned, even though it is unimportant!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He means that intent takes effect on what <i>will</i> be lost or burned (Tosfos - it was falling into a fire at the time; Rashi - it just happened to get lost later. We do not say that retroactively, his intent was for something unimportant.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> R. Akiva holds that Zerikah takes effect if the meat was Yotzei, but not if the blood was Yotzei (and returned and thrown).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If Shechitah was valid and the blood was Yotzei, even if it was returned and thrown, it has no effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Kodshei Kodashim, there is still Me'ilah. Regarding Kodshim Kalim, there is still no Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> If one was Makdish (a Chatas, lost it, was Makdish another, then found the first and slaughtered both of them...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> R. Akiva discusses when both of them were slaughtered at the same time. (Rashi - this is literally true. Tosfos - Zerikah was not done until both were slaughtered.) If one was slaughtered first, he would not say that Zerikah helps for both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> I was asked if R. Akiva holds that Zerikah helps for Yotzei. I answered that he does;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon's colleagues (to him):</span> How can it be Meratzeh for something Pasul?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon told R. Akiva what his colleagues asked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva (to R. Shimon):</span> Surely, you agree that Zerikah helps!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If one was Makdish a Chatas, lost it, was Makdish another, and then found the first, Me'ilah applies to both of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If both were slaughtered and Kabalah was done in two Kelim, Me'ilah applies to both animals;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If Zerikah of one of them was done, surely you agree that just like it exempts its own meat from Me'ilah, it also exempts the other animal's meat!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>If it exempts another animal's meat from Me'ilah, even though the other animal is Pasul, all the more so, regarding Yotzei, Zerikah should exempt meat of the animal itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> R. Akiva's answer was deceptive!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>("Both were slaughtered" connotes at the same time, but) since he holds that Zerikah helps for something Pasul, it should help even if they were slaughtered one after the other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> His answer was proper!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one was Makdish two Ashamos for Acharayus, and slaughtered both, and brought the Eimurim of one on the Mizbe'ach before Zerikah of either, surely you agree that (even if Zerikah of the other was done,) Yerdu (the Eimurim must be removed from the Mizbe'ach);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We would not say this if both were considered like one Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If Eimurei Kodshim Kalim were placed on the Mizbe'ach before Zerikah, Lo Yerdu (they are not removed). They became "food" of the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Reish Lakish could not answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> I have cut the feet of (refuted) the young one (Reish Lakish).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>ZERIKAH</i> CAUSES LENIENCIES AND STRINGENCIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Zerikah is Mekil and Machmir (cause leniencies and stringencies) regarding Kodshei Kodashim. Regarding Kodshim Kalim, it causes only stringencies:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Before Zerikah, Me'ilah applies to the Eimurim and meat of Kodshei Kodashim. After Zerikah, it applies only to the Eimurim, but not to the meat, and Pigul, Nosar and Tamei apply to both of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Zerikah is lenient (regarding Me'ilah in the meat) and stringent (regarding Pigul, Nosar and Tamei);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Before Zerikah, Me'ilah does not apply to the Eimurim or meat of Kodshim Kalim. After Zerikah, it applies to the Eimurim, but not to the meat, and Pigul, Nosar and Tamei apply to both of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Zerikah is only stringent (regarding the Eimurim, Pigul, Nosar and Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> Me'ilah does not apply to meat (of Kodshei Kodashim after Zerikah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Me'ilah does not apply, but there is an Isur (even for a Kohen to benefit from it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it forbidden? It belongs to the Kohen (to eat)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is permitted. It says "Me'ilah does not apply" for parallel structure with the Reisha, which says that Me'ilah applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> Before Zerikah, Me'ilah does not apply to the Eimurim or meat of Kodshim Kalim. After Zerikah, it applies to the Eimurim, but not to the meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Me'ilah does not apply (to meat after Zerikah), but there is an Isur to benefit from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Why is this? It belongs to the owner (to eat)! (We cannot answer as above, for the Reisha of the Seifa says that Me'ilah does not apply to the Eimurim or meat before Zerikah, and there indeed it is forbidden. Presumably, the same applies to the Seifa of the Seifa!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> The Seifa discusses (meat that was) Yotzei. It is like R. Akiva;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> R. Akiva holds that Zerikah takes effect on Yotzei regarding burning (Rashi - Ibur Tzurah (letting it become Nosar) is required; Pirush Kadmon (B) - it must be burned in the Azarah). It does not permit eating it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> R. Akiva holds that Zerikah takes effect on Yotzei (regarding Me'ilah, Pigul, Nosar and Tamei), but in any case it must be burned. It may not be eaten. (Tosfos Yom Tov - the Rambam forbids the meat only mid'Rabanan. It seems that most Meforshim forbid it mid'Oraisa.)</p>
