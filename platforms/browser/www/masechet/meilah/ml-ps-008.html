<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ME'ILAH OF CHATAS HA'OF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Me'ilah applies to Chatas ha'Of from when it is Hukdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>After Melikah, it is able to become Pasul if touched by a Tevul Yom (one who immersed from Tum'ah today. He is still slightly Tamei until nightfall) or a Mechusar Kipurim, or through Linah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>After Haza'ah (sprinkling its blood), one can be liable (for eating it) due to Pigul, Nosar and Tamei. Me'ilah does not apply to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> After Melikah, it is able to become Pasul if touched by a Tevul Yom or Mechusar Kipurim, or through Linah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It will become <i>Pasul</i> (disqualified) if they touch it, but it will not become <i>Tamei</i> (able to disqualify other Kodshim due to Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is like Chachamim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Shaul):</span> A Tevul Yom is a Rishon l'Tum'ah regarding Kodshim. (I.e. if he touches Kodesh, it become a Sheni, i.e. a second-level Tum'ah);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir says, a Tevul Yom makes Kodesh become Tamei (a Shelishi, which can disqualify other Kodesh) and makes Terumah become Pasul (a Shelishi. It cannot disqualify other Terumah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, just like he disqualifies (but is not Metamei) food and drink of Terumah, he disqualifies food and drink of Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> (Our Mishnah could be like Aba Shaul or R. Meir. It teaches the Torah law. They are more stringent mid'Rabanan;)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Aba Shaul holds that (earlier) Chachamim made a Ma'alah (stringency) in Kodshim, to consider a Tevul Yom like a Rishon l'Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir holds that the Ma'alah was to consider a Tevul Yom like a Sheni;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim hold that since he immersed, his Tum'ah is weak, so he is only Posel. He is not Metamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> After Haza'ah, one can be liable... (Me'ilah does not apply).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Me'ilah does not apply, but there is an Isur (even for a Kohen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it forbidden? It belongs to the Kohen (to eat)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> The case is, it was Yotzei. It is like R. Akiva;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that Zerikah takes effect on Yotzei, but one may not eat it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS <i>MITZUY</i> OF A CHATAS HA’OF <i>ME'AKEV</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> Mitzuy of Chatas ha'Of (pressing the bird against the Mizbe'ach to squeeze out the blood) is not Me'akev;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav's text in the Mishnah is (like ours) "after Haza'ah... " (Haza'ah alone brings atonement.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah citing Rav):</span> Mitzuy of Chatas ha'Of is Me'akev;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His text in the Mishnah is "after Mitzuy... ."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Veha'Nish'ar ba'Dam Yimatzei El Yesod ha'Mizbe'ach Chatas Hu" is not difficult for Rav Ada. It is a (valid) Chatas only if Mitzuy was done;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to Rav Huna, it is valid even without Mitzuy. Why does it say "veha'Nish'ar" (the rest of the blood must be pressed on the Mizbe'ach)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches like Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael - Beraisa):</span> Mitzuy is done if blood remains. (If not, it is not Me'akev.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Chatas Hu"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to the Reisha of the verse. (It teaches that Haza'ah is Me'akev.)</p>
