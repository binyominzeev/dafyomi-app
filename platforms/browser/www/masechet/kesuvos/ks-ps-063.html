<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>R. AKIVA'S WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Akiva saw that she desired that he continue learning, so he learned for another 12 years. He returned home with 24,000 Talmidim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>His wife heard that he was returning, and went to greet him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Neighbors:</span> You should borrow better clothes to greet him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">His wife:</span> "A Tzadik knows the soul of his animal."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When she reached him, she bowed to the ground and kissed his feet. R. Akiva's attendants started to dispel her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Leave her! My Torah and yours is due to her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Her father heard that a great Chacham came. He went to see him, hoping to annul his vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> When you vowed, did you intend to forbid her even if her husband would become a great Chacham? (Tosfos - this is normal for one who goes to learn, therefore this was a valid Pesach to permit the vow.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Ben Kalba Savu'a:</span> Had I known that he would learn even one Perek, or even one Halachah, I would not have vowed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> I am your son-in-law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>His father-in-law bowed and kissed his foot, and gave half his money to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Akiva's daughter did similarly with Ben Azai. (However, Ben Azai became so enamoured with Torah that he could not remain married - see Tosfos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like people say, a sheep follows a sheep. The daughter did like her mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rava sent his son Rav Yosef to learn for six years. After three years, his son decided to see his family, on Erev Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rava heard that he was coming; he took a weapon and went to greet him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> (You interrupted your learning because) you remembered your harlot (some texts - your spouse)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rava):</span> You remembered your dove (mate)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They quarreled, and neither ate the pre-fast meal.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A SPOUSE WHO REBELS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman rebels against her husband (this will be explained), we reduce her Kesuvah by seven Dinarim every week;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, we deduct seven Tarpa'ikin every week.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This continues until her Kesuvah is depleted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi says, we decrease indefinitely (and record how much she owes to him). Perhaps she will inherit money, and he will collect from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Similarly, if a man rebels against his wife, we add three Dinarim to her Kesuvah every week;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah says, we add three Tarpa'ikin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is her rebellion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> She refuses to have Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> She refuses to work.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if a man rebels against his wife...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this according to Rav Huna (he refuses to have Bi'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But according to R. Yosi bar Chanina, is he obligated to work for her?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He refuses to feed her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav taught that a man who refuses to feed his wife must divorce her and pay her Kesuvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We first ask him to retract (and during this time we add to her Kesuvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The law of rebellion applies whether she is an Arusah or a Nesu'ah, even if she is Nidah, even if she is sick, and even a Shomeres Yavam. (Some texts, including Rashi's omit the next lines until Question (p).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not difficult if rebellion is from work.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if she rebels from Bi'ah, why do we decrease her Kesuvah? A Nidah may not have Bi'ah in any case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Without her rebellion, her husband was (content) like one who has bread in his basket (later, she will be permitted). Now, he is (troubled) like one whose basket is empty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, rebellion from Bi'ah applies even when she is sick;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if she rebels from work, when she is sick in any case she cannot work!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All agree that rebellion from Bi'ah is rebellion. They argue about whether or not rebellion from work is <i>also</i> rebellion.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE LATER ENACTMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman rebels, we reduce her Kesuvah by seven Dinarim every week;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, we deduct seven Tarpa'ikin every week.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Raboseinu later voted to announce for four consecutive Shabbosos that she is rebelling. Beis Din sends to inform her that even if her Kesuvah is 100 Maneh, she will lose it all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The law of rebellion applies whether she is an Arusah or a Nesu'ah, even if she is Nidah, even if she is sick, and even if she is a Shomeres Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Yosef):</span> A Nidah may not have Bi'ah (why is she considered a rebel)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> One who has bread in his basket is unlike one without bread in his basket.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> We announce about her only in the Beis ha'Keneses and Beis Medrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava - Beraisa):</span> We announce for four consecutive Shabbosos. (On Shabbos everyone is in the Beis ha'Keneses or Beis Medrash.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> Beis Din sends to her twice, once before the announcements, and once after them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> The Halachah follows Raboseinu.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> That is improper!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> What is improper about it? I said so to Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda in the name of a great man, R. Yosi bar Chanina!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom does Rava hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like Rav Sheshes:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava citing Rav Sheshes):</span> The Halachah is, we deliberate with her (we delay the Get, reducing her Kesuvah each week. Perhaps she will cease her rebellion.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Yehudah citing Rav Sheshes):</span> The Halachah is, we do not deliberate with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of a rebel (in which we deliberate)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ameimar):</span> She desires (to stay married to) him, she just wants to pain him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she said that he is repulsive to her, we do not force her (to remain with him. He divorces her without a Kesuvah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar Zutra):</span> (Even in this case,) we force her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred, and Mar Zutra forced her to stay married. She (ceased to despise her husband, and) gave birth to R. Chanina of Sura.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (This does not prove that if we force her, she will desire him again.) There, Shamayim helped (so that R. Chanina would be born)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>Rav Zvid's daughter-in-law rebelled. She was holding a silk garment that she brought into the marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Ameimar, Mar Zutra and Rav Ashi):</span> One who rebels forfeits the existing Bala'os (the remnants of property that she brought into the marriage).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Gamda):</span> Do you flatter Rav Zvid (pervert the ruling to favor his son) because he is a great Chacham?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> Rava never resolved whether or not she forfeits the existing Bala'os (therefore, she should keep what is in her possession)!</p>
