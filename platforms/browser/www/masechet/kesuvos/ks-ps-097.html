<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much does a widow sell at one time for food?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> She sells for 12 months at a time. The buyer gives to her money for a month's food at a time</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> She sells for six months at a time. The buyer gives to her money for a month's food at a time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Huna - Beraisa #1):</span> She sells for 12 months at a time. The buyer gives to her money for a month's food at a time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yehudah - Beraisa #2):</span> She sells for six months at a time. The buyer gives to her money for a month's food at a time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> The Halachah is, she sells for six months at a time. The buyer gives to her money for a month's food at a time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> This is unlike Rav Huna!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Ameimar:</span> I disagree with Rav Huna.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a widow sold land for food, can she take the land from the buyers to collect her Kesuvah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This question pertains to Rav Yosef's law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If a widow sold land, the Acharayos (to compensate the buyer if it is taken) is against the orphans. The same is true when Beis Din sells the orphans' land.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Do we say that since the Acharayos is on the orphans, she can take the land?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, even though she is not responsible if others take the land, she is responsible if she herself takes it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> She sells land (for food), and leaves a remnant on which she can rely to collect her Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that she must leave over land. She cannot take what she sold for food!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps she can take it, but the Beraisa counsels her not to, lest people call her a wavering person.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection - Question:</span> If so, it would have said that she collects from the rest. Why does it say that she leaves a remnant on which she can rely?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that if she did not leave over, she cannot collect from what she sold.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ONE WHO SOLD AND DID NOT NEED THE MONEY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a man sold land because he needed money, then found that he did not need the money, can he retract the sale?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A man sold land to Rav Papa, because he needed to by oxen. In the end, he did not need the oxen. Rav Papa returned the land to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Rav Papa was not required to do so. He went beyond the letter of the law.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> There was an inflation in Nehardai. Everyone sold their houses. In the end, wheat came;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah is, everyone gets his house back.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, the sale was a mistake. Ships with wheat had already come (but were not in the standard part of the river, so people did not know about them).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Support:</span> This explains Rami bar Shmuel's objection (this is prone to happen again).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Question:</span> If so, how do we understand Rami bar Shmuel? (This is a rare case!) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rami bar Shmuel (to Rav Nachman):</span> Your ruling will prevent people from buying in the future!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Are famines everyday occurrences?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rami bar Shmuel:</span> In Nehardai they are!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The Halachah is, if one sold and in the end he did not need the money, he may retract the sale.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MUST A WIDOW SELL PROPERTY IN BEIS DIN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A widow, whether from Eirusin or Nisu'in, may sell outside of Beis Din;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon says, a widow from Nisu'in may sell outside of Beis Din. A widow from Eirusin, she must sell in Beis Din;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because from Eirusin she is not fed, and anyone who is not fed must sell in Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Granted, a widow from Nisu'in may sell outside of Beis Din for food (she cannot wait to go to Beis Din when she needs to eat).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">97b----------------------------------------97b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But why do Chachamim permit a widow from Eirusin to sell outside Beis Din?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> This is to encourage marriage.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> A man does not want his wife to be disgraced by having to go to Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>These answers argue about a divorcee;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we want to encourage marriage, we should be lenient regarding a divorcee as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the husband wanted to spare his wife disgrace, he is concerned only for his widow, not for a woman he divorced.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa (the coming Mishnah)):</span> A divorced woman must sell in Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like R. Yochanan. He is not concerned for disgrace of his ex-wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But according to Ula, we should be lenient regarding a divorcee as well, to encourage marriage!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa is R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Shimon already taught that a widow from Eirusin must sell in Beis Din (and the same applies to a divorcee)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that there is more need to encourage marriage regarding a divorcee, and she may sell outside of Beis Din. The Seifa teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Anyone who is not fed must sell in Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is to include a divorcee!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it includes a woman who is doubtfully divorced. (Rashi - she is not feed from the orphans after her husband dies; Tosfos - she receives food in her husband's lifetime, and may sell outside of Beis Din.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Wherever Chachamim said that 'She is divorced and not divorced', the husband must feed her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Just like she sells outside of Beis Din, also her heirs who inherit her Kesuvah may sell outside of Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like the opinion that her husband wanted to spare his wife disgrace. He is also concerned for her heirs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But according to the opinion that it is to encourage marriage, we need not be lenient for her heirs!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> The case is, her daughter or sister inherited her. (Rashi - if it is humiliating for her heir to collect, her heir will not want to marry.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ONE WHO SOLD PART OF HER KESUVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Mishnah:</span> In the following cases a woman may sell to collect the rest of her Kesuvah only in Beis Din:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>She sold her Kesuvah, or part of it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>She gave her Kesuvah for collateral, or part of it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>She gave her Kesuvah as a gift, or part of it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say that she may sell even four or five times, and she may sell outside of Beis Din for food, and she writes 'I sold this for food'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A divorcee must sell in Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If she sold her (entire) Kesuvah, or gave her Kesuvah for collateral, or designated her Kesuvah to repay a loan, she is not fed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, even if she sold or gave for collateral only half her Kesuvah, she forfeits being fed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Chachamim say that (being owed) part is like (being owed) the entire amount, and R. Shimon disagrees.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They hold the opposite!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "(A Kohen Gadol) will marry a woman bi'Vsuleha (with her tokens of virginity)" - this excludes a Bogeres, whose Besulim are (partially) depleted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar and R. Shimon permit a Bogeres.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, they argue about how to expound the verse;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir says that 'Besulah' connotes having some Besulim. 'Besulehah' connotes having all of them. "Bi'Vsuleha" connotes virginity in the place of normal Bi'ah, but not necessarily in the place of Lo k'Darkah (the anus);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar and R. Shimon say that 'Besulah' connotes all the Besulim. 'Besulehah' connotes even some. "Bi'Vsuleha" mandates virginity even in the place of Lo k'Darkah.</p></div>
