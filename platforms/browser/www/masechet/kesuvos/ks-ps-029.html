<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>FOR WHICH GIRLS IS A RAPIST FINED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There is a fine for (raping or seducing) any of the following Na'aros (girls in the first six months of adulthood):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Mamzeres, Nesinah or Kusis;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A convert, captive or slave who converted, was redeemed or was freed below the age of three;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The rapist's sister, paternal or maternal aunt, his wife's sister, his brother's wife, his paternal uncle's wife, or a Nidah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Even though these are punishable by Kares (excision), they are not capital offenses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Is there a fine only for Pasul women, but not for regular women?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches that there is a fine for these Pasul women: a Mamzeres...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> There is a fine for a Na'arah, but not for a minor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Meir:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> From the day a girl is born until she brings two hairs (after 12 years), she can be sold (to be a slave), but there is no fine for her. From when she brings two hairs until she becomes a Bogeres (six months later), she has a fine but cannot be sold;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The rule is, when she can be sold, there is no fine for her. When there is a fine for her, she cannot be sold.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say that there is a fine for her from the age of three years and one day until she becomes a Bogeres.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does she have a fine, but she cannot be sold?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, there is a fine for her even when she can be sold.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A FINE FOR WOMEN WHO MAY NOT MARRY THE MAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is there a fine for these women?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"She will be his wife" - she must be permitted to be his wife!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> We expound (in the Parashah of a rapist) "Na'arah", "(ha')<i>Na'arah</i>", and "<i>ha</i>'Na'arah". (Since the entire word 'ha'Na'arah' is extra, we expound two laws from it, for the word itself and for the 'Hei'.) One teaches the simple meaning (she must be a Na'arah), one teaches about (a fine for) Chayavei Lavin (women forbidden by a Lav), and one teaches about (a fine for) Chayavei Krisos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> We expound (in the Parashah of a seducer) "Besulah", "(ha)'<i>Besulos</i>", and "<i>ha</i>'Besulos". One teaches the simple meaning, one teaches about Chayavei Lavin, and one teaches about Chayavei Krisos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Papa did not learn like Reish Lakish, because he uses "ha'Na'arah" to teach Abaye's law:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If she died before the rapist was brought to trial, he is exempt. "He will give to the father of ha'Na'arah", not to the father of the deceased.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish did not learn like Rav Papa, because he uses "ha'Besulos" for a Gezeirah Shavah:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Kesef Yishkol (he will pay) k'Mohar ha'Besulos" - the fine of a seducer should be like the Mohar of a Besulah (50, the fine specified for a rapist), and the Mohar of a Besulah should be like the fine of a seducer (in Shekalim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Reish Lakish also needs to learn Abaye's law, and Rav Papa also needs the Gezeirah Shavah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, we expound six words or letters: Na'arah, (ha')<i>Na'arah</i>, <i>ha</i>'Na'arah, Besulah, (ha')<i>Besulos</i>, <i>ha</i>'Besulos. We need two for the simple meaning. One is used for Abaye's law, one is used for the Gezeirah Shavah, one teaches about Chayavei Lavin, and one teaches about Chayavei Krisos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Tana of our Mishnah disagrees with the following Tana'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Shimon ha'Teimani):</span> "She will be his wife" refers to a woman with whom Kidushin is Tofsin (takes effect);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Menasya says, it refers to a woman whom he may keep.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do these Tana'im argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about a Mamzeres or Nesinah (Chayavei Lavin);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kidushin is Tofsin with them, but a Yisrael may not stay married to them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Akiva, who says that Ein Kidushin Tofsin b'Chayavei Lavin, what do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about a Kohen Gadol who raped a widow, like R. Simai taught.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Simai):</span> R. Akiva says that children of any marriage of Chayavei Lavin are Mamzerim, except for a widow married to a Kohen Gadol;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Torah forbids him to marry her and "YeCHaLeL (profane) his children" - he makes his children CHaLaLiM (profane), not Mamzerim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yesheivav says that R. Akiva holds that the child of any forbidden Bi'ah is a Mamzer. According to him, what do Shimon ha'Teimani and R. Shimon ben Menasya argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about Chayavei Aseh, such as a Mitzris or Edomis (Kidushin is Tofsin, but it is forbidden).</p></div>
