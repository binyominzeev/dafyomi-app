<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A CAPITAL OFFENSE EXEMPTS FROM PAYMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> R. Nechunya ben Hakanah agrees that one who stole Chelev and ate it must pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is liable to pay once he picks it up. He is not Chayav Misah until he eats it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Chisda disagrees with R. Avin:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> If one threw an arrow four Amos (in a Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos) and it tore silk along the way, he is exempt from paying. An arrow cannot land unless it was thrown (his Chiyuv Misah starts with the throwing).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here too, R. Avin would also say that one cannot eat Chelev unless he lifts it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The cases are different;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Reason #1:</span> An arrow cannot land without being thrown. One can eat without lifting the Chelev. He can bend down and eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Reason #2:</span> One cannot retrieve an arrow after shooting it. One can return the Chelev after picking it up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>These reasons argue about one who carries a knife four Amos in a Reshus ha'Rabim (on Shabbos) and tears silk along the way;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to reason #1, also here the Chiyuv Misah starts with setting the knife in motion, so he should be exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to reason #2, here he could stop the knife in the middle, so he should pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> If one threw an arrow four Amos and it tore silk along the way, he is exempt because an arrow cannot land unless it was thrown.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Bivi bar Abaye - Beraisa):</span> One who steals a wallet on Shabbos must pay, because the theft precedes the desecration of Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was dragging the wallet he is exempt, because the theft and the Chilul Shabbos come simultaneously.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here, too, we should say that he cannot put the wallet down unless he picked it up (and the Chiyuv Misah started then)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, he picked up the wallet intending to hide it (so the Chiyuv did not start then), then reconsidered to take it out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> One is not liable for Chilul Shabbos in such a case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one was moving things from one corner to another and reconsidered to take them out, he is not liable for Chilul Shabbos because his initial intention was not to take them out.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OTHER WAYS TO EXPLAIN THE <i>BERAISA</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He intended to take it out from the start, but he stopped in the middle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he stopped to adjust the load, this is normally done while carrying (so still, the Chilul Shabbos starts with picking it up)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he stopped to rest (the Chilul Shabbos starts when he resumed walking).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he stopped to readjust the load, he would be exempt.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Beraisa should distinguish between stopping to rest and to readjust, rather than between carrying and dragging!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is like Ben Azai, who says that each step a person takes is considered to be resting (so the Chilul Shabbos starts only when he steps outside).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This would not apply if he threw the wallet. If so, he should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Beraisa should distinguish between carrying and throwing, rather than between carrying and dragging!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must teach the case of dragging so one will not think that this is not a normal way to carry a wallet, and he would not be liable for Chilul Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What size is the wallet?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is small, dragging is not normal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is big, obviously dragging it is normal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is a medium size wallet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To where did he take it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he took it to a Reshus ha'Rabim he is liable for Chilul Shabbos, but he is not yet liable for theft (Meshichah does not acquire there)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he took it to his own domain, he is liable for theft, but not for Chilul Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he brought it to a shoulder of a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Tana's opinion about a shoulder of a Reshus ha'Rabim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he holds like R. Eliezer, who says that it is like a Reshus ha'Rabim, he is liable for Chilul Shabbos, but not (yet) for theft!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he holds like Chachamim, who say that it is not like a Reshus ha'Rabim, he is liable for theft, but not for Chilul Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like R. Eliezer. R. Eliezer considers it like a Reshus ha'Rabim regarding Shabbos, because the road is often congested and people are pushed to the shoulder;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding acquisitions, it is not like Reshus ha'Rabim, since people are not often there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> He put his hand (that he was not dragging it with) within three Tefachim of the ground and received the wallet.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Rava's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A man's hand is considered like a place four Tefachim by four Tefachim (to be liable for Hanachah on Shabbos. Likewise, it can acquire.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Rav Acha learned like Rav Ashi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Ravina):</span> Really, he took the wallet to a Reshus ha'Rabim. A theft is acquired even in a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ACQUIRING IN A <i>RESHUS</i> <i>HA'RABIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Acha and Ravina argue about what we infer from the following Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man was dragging an ox to steal it and it died before he left the owner's premises, he is exempt. If he lifted it or took it out of the premises before it died, he must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Ravina learned from the Reisha. He is exempt because he did not yet leave the premises. Had he left, even to a Reshus ha'Rabim, he would have to pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Acha learned from the Seifa, which discusses lifting and taking it out. This shows that they are the same;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like lifting it brings it to his domain, also taking it out must be to his domain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha contradicts Rav Acha, and the Seifa contradicts Ravina!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (for Rav Acha):</span> Until the thief reaches his domain, he is considered to be in the owner's premises.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (for Ravina):</span> We do not equate taking it out to lifting it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DOES ONE PAY OR SUFFER LASHES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who raped or seduced his sister (pays a fine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #1):</span> The following are lashed: one who has Bi'ah with his sister, his father's sister, his mother's sister, Achos Ishto, the wife of his brother, the wife of his father's brother, or a Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We hold that one does not pay and get lashed for one sin!</p>
