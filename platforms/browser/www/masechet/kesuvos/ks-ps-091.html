<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN THE HUSBAND DIED IN THE MIDDLE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #1:</span> They argue about whether the extra Dinar must be land, or if it can even be Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana holds that it must be land. R. Shimon holds that it can even be Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (the coming Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Even if there is extra Metaltelim, the enactment applies only if there is an extra Dinar of land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #2:</span> They argue about whether or not the extra Dinar may be sold land, or if it must be Bnei Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana requires Bnei Chorin. R. Shimon allows sold land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, why does R. Shimon say '<i>if</i> there is an extra Dinar...'? He should say '<i>because</i> there is an extra Dinar!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #3:</span> They argue about whether a full extra Dinar is required, or if even less than a Dinar suffices.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana requires a full Dinar; R. Shimon allows even less than a Dinar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Shimon says that there must be an extra Dinar! (This connotes a full Dinar.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we misunderstood the Beraisa. Really, the first Tana says that the enactment applies (even with less than a Dinar), and R. Shimon says that it applies only when there is a (full) extra Dinar!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Rashi - the first Tana means, (even) this (i.e. the <i>first</i>) woman's sons collect her Kesuvah after her death (due to Kesuvas Benin Dichrin), even without an extra Dinar. Tosfos - the first Tana said that there is no enactment when there is no excess. When there is <i>any</i> excess, it applies.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> In the coming Mishnah, R. Shimon and the Chachamim who argue with him agree that a Dinar is required!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Defense of Explanations #1 and #2:</span> We switch our understanding of the Beraisa. The first Tana says that the enactment applies even if the extra Dinar is Metaltelim, or (in Explanation #2) sold land. R. Shimon says that it applies only if the extra Dinar is of land (in Explanation #2 it must be Bnei Chorin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> The Halachah is, Kesuvas Benin Dichrin applies when the husband dies in the middle. The Halachah is, a Kesuvah is considered like an extra Dinar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why it was not enough to say only that Kesuvas Benin Dichrin applies when he dies in the middle, for we might have thought that a Kesuvah is not considered like an extra Dinar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why didn't he just say that a Kesuvah is considered like an extra Dinar? We could deduce that Kesuvas Benin Dichrin applies when he dies in the middle!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the case is that he married three women, two of whom died before him and the third died after him, and she left only a daughter (and the collection of her Kesuvah counts as an extra Dinar);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if a woman who left sons died after him there is no enactment, lest there be quarrels! Mar Zutra teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN DOES THE ENACTMENT APPLY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man married two women and died after them, and the orphans demand the Kesuvah of their mother and there is enough only to pay the Kesuvos, the heirs split the estate equally;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If there is a Dinar more than the Kesuvos, the sons of each mother receive their mother's Kesuvah. If orphans (of one mother) request to accept property at an inflated price, in order that the estate will be considered to have an extra Dinar, we do not accede. Rather, Beis Din evaluates the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Property that was destined to fall to the father is not part of the calculation;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon says, even if there is extra Metaltelim, it means nothing. We require an extra Dinar of land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If the Kesuvos are 1000 and 500, if there is an extra Dinar, each woman's sons receive their mother's Kesuvah. If not, they split the property equally.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Obviously, if there was an extra Dinar when he died, but the property depreciated (and when it is appraised, there is not an extra Dinar), the orphans (whose mother had the larger Kesuvah) already merited. (The enactment applies.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there was not an extra Dinar when he died, but the property went up in value, does the enactment apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Such a case came before Rav Amram. He told the sons (whose mother had the small Kesuvah) to appease the sons of the other mother; if not, he will excommunicate them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They came before Rav Nachman. He said that just like when there was an extra Dinar and the property depreciated, the orphans already merited, so too when there was not an extra Dinar and the property rose in value (Rashi - the sons whose mother had the small Kesuvah merited that the enactment does not apply. Tosfos - the sons whose mother had the large Kesuvah merited that the enactment applies.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>COLLECTION OF DEBTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A man owed 1000 Zuz. He had two mansions, and sold each for 500 Zuz (to the same man).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The creditor took one mansion, and was about to take the other. The buyer took 1000 Zuz cash and said 'if one mansion is worth 1000 to you, consider one mansion full collection. If not, take 1000 Zuz.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> This is like our Mishnah. If the orphans offer to accept the value of the property above its true value (we do not heed them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> No. There, there is a loss (to the children of the mother with the small Kesuvah). Here, the creditor lent 1000 and receives 1000!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to Rava, if the creditor accepted one mansion as payment,) when we write a document saying that the buyer's land was taken to pay the debt (and the seller owes him for it), for how much do we write it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> We write for 1000 Zuz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Avira):</span> We write for 500 Zuz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Halachah is, we write for 500 Zuz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A man owed 100 Zuz, and had two small plots of land. He sold each for 50 Zuz (to the same man).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The creditor took one plot, and was about to take the other. The buyer took 100 Zuz cash and told him, if one plot is worth 100 to you, consider one plot full collection; if not, take 100 Zuz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> This is like our Mishnah. If the orphans offer to accept the value of the property above its true value (we do not heed them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> No. There, there is a loss (to the children of the mother with the small Kesuvah). Here, the creditor lent 100 and receives 100!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to Abaye, if the creditor accepted one plot as payment,) when we write a document saying that the buyer's land was taken to pay the debt, for how much do we write it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> We write for 100 Zuz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Avira):</span> We write for 50 Zuz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>The Halachah is, we write for 50 Zuz. (An early version of Rashi, cited in Shitah Mekubetzes, asks why they needed to argue about this twice, and the Gemara need to rule like Rav Avira twice. He is unsure if we could distinguish land from houses. Chidushei ha'Rim says that this law depends on Dina d'Var Metzra (a neighbor's right to buy land before anyone else); some say that this does not apply to houses. The Me'iri says that in the latter episode, there were two different buyers. Alternatively, in both cases there were two buyers. They differ regarding from which the creditor collected first.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>A man owed 100 Zuz. He died, and the only land he left was a plot worth 50 Zuz. The creditor took it as partial payment. The orphans gave him 50 Zuz (and took the land back); the creditor took it again for final payment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> It is a Mitzvah for orphans to pay the debt of their father. The 50 Zuz they gave the creditor was l'Shem Mitzvah. The creditor was entitled to take the land again.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if the orphans did not say that the 50 Zuz is the value of the land. If they said this, they expel him from the land (and he cannot collect any more, since the father didn't leave any other land).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FOR WHAT DOES A PERSON ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Levi sold his mother's Kesuvah for Tovas Hana'ah (a small amount, since the buyer does not get anything until she is widowed or divorced, and gets nothing if she dies before her husband or if Levi dies before her). Levi stipulated that he will not give compensation if his mother protests. (A second explanation in Rashi says that after his father died, Levi sold land of his father that had been designated to pay the Kesuvah, for Tovas Hana'ah. The sale would be valid as long as his mother did not take the land.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His mother never protested, and she died (after her husband). The son protested (the buyer should not collect).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> He is in place of his mother (and he stipulated not to compensate if she protests).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Granted, he did not accept Acharayos (responsibility to compensate) for her protest, but for his own, he certainly did!</p>
