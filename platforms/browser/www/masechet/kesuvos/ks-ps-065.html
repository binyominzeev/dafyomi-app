<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DO WE ALLOT WINE TO A WOMAN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He gives to her a half Kav of pulse...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Mishnah does not say that he gives to her wine. This supports R. Elazar:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> We do not allot wine to a woman (lest it arouse her lust).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Those who give... v'Shikuyai (my drinks) " shows that women normally drink!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'SHiKuyai refers to things for which a woman is MiSHtoKekes (desires), i.e. jewelry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> We do not allot wine to a woman. It says "Chanah got up after her eating... and <i>his</i> drinking", not after <i>her</i> drinking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should likewise deduce "<i>her</i> eating", and not <i>his</i> eating! (But surely, also men eat!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the verse discusses her, "his drinking" is unnatural, so we expound it. (There is no reason to expound "her eating".)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If she is accustomed, we give to her (wine).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> When she is used to wine it is different (then it will not arouse her lust), like the following teaching:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chinena):</span> If she is accustomed, we give to her one cup; if not, we give to her two.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> If she is accustomed to two cups when with her husband, we give to her one cup when she is alone. If she normally has one cup with him, we do not give to her at all when she is alone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> A woman who is accustomed receives wine for cooking:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Chachamim allotted two Sa'im of wine (between 16 and 29 liters) for the daughter-in-law of Nakdimon ben Guryon (who was exceedingly wealthy) to use in cooking each week.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">His daughter-in-law:</span> So you should allot to your daughters!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Beraisa:</span> She was a widow who fell to Yibum. (Enraged by the meager allotment, she cursed them that their daughters should also fall to Yibum, so) they did not answer Amen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One cup (of wine) is good for a woman. Two is disgracing. If she has three, she will verbally demand Bi'ah. If she has four, she will seek bestiality with a donkey in the market (in public), without shame.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is when her husband is not with her. When he is with her, there is no concern.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chanah was with her husband (and we learned from her that women do not drink)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Halachah is different when they lodge away from home;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> A guest is forbidden to have Bi'ah - "They returned to their city... and Elkanah had Bi'ah with his wife", but not before.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Abaye's widow Chomah came in front of Rava and requested that he allot wine for her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I know that Abaye did not drink wine!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chomah:</span> I swear that he did! I used to give to him in vessels like this (as long as my arm).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>While she was demonstrating, her arm was revealed. The Beis Din was lit up. Rava desired Bi'ah, so he went to his wife, Rav Chisda's daughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>His wife asked who was in Beis Din that sparked his desire. When she heard that it was Chomah, she hit her with the lock of a chest and chased Chomah out of the city.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava's wife:</span> You already killed three men (she was widowed twice before marrying Abaye, and was Muchzekes to cause her husbands to die), and you seek to (entice men with your beauty and) kill another?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>The wife of Rav Yosef bar Rava asked Rav Nechemyah bar Rav Yosef to allot wine for her; he did so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nechemyah:</span> I know that people of her city drink wine (she 	is used to it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>The widow of Rav Yosef brei d'Rav Menashiya asked Rav Yosef to allot wine for her; he did so. She requested that he allot silk for her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Why do you need silk?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">The widow:</span> I need for you and your colleagues (lest I be disgraced in your eyes).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>KELIM ALLOTED TO WOMEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He gives to her a bed and a mat...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does she need a mattress (and mat? Tosfos omits these words from the text.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> This is in a place where the bed-ropes are uncovered. Sleeping on such a bed without a mattress is painful.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not give to her a pillow and blanket;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Nasan says, we give to her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is normal for her family, the first Tana should agree that she gets it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is not normal for her family, why would R. Nasan say that she gets it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is normal for his family, but not for hers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana says that he can tell her 'When I go, I will take them. When I return, I will bring them!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Nasan says, she can counter 'sometimes you will return right before Shabbos and will be unable to bring them. You will take my (mat, or pillow and blanket that I myself bought), and force me to sleep on the floor!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He gives to her a kerchief...</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">65b----------------------------------------65b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Why does the Tana allot to her clothing only once a year, but allots for her shoes every festival?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Tana is in a mountainous place, where three pairs of shoes are needed each year;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana counsels that one should give them to her at the festival, to make her happy on the festival.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He gives clothes worth 50 Zuz...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> These are simple Zuzim (they are seven eighths copper, and hence worth only an eighth of Zuzim of Tzur of pure silver).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We derive this from the Seifa, which says that we discuss the poorest Yisrael. Such a person would not have 50 Zuz of pure silver!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Excess food belongs to the husband. Extra Bala'os of clothing belong to the wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does she need them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rachbah):</span> She wears them when she is Nidah, lest she be despised to her husband (by wearing the same clothing when she is Tehorah as when she is Nidah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Extra Bala'os of clothing of a widow belong to the heirs (also they buy for her 50 Zuz of clothing each year).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In this case, there is no concern if she is despised.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF THE HUSBAND</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'she eats with him on Shabbos night'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Literally, she eats with him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> They have Bi'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say 'she eats with him?'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a euphemism - "She ate... and said 'I did not sin.'"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> She eats with him on Shabbos night and Shabbos (day).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We understand according to the opinion that this literally means eating;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But if it means Bi'ah, do they have Bi'ah during the day?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Yisrael are holy, and do not have Bi'ah during the day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava taught that it is permitted in a dark house.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she was nursing...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ula Rabah):</span> Even though Chachamim said that a man need not feed his children when they are minors, he must feed very small children.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Until what age is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is until six (full) years.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> A six year-old may rely on the Eruv of his mother. (Chachamim made his law like hers, for he depends on her. Likewise, his father must feed him along with his mother.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did R. Ula derive his law from our Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says that a nursing woman is given more food.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He must supply the extra food a nursing woman needs because he must also feed the baby!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The case is, she is sick (and requires more food).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, the Mishnah should say 'if she is sick...'! Why did it discuss a nursing wife?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps it teaches that nursing women are assumed to be sick.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> We allot wine to a nursing mother, for this is good for the milk.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PRIVILEGES A MAN HAS IN HIS WIFE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man receives Metzi'os that his wife finds and her earnings. He receives the Peiros of what she inherits in her lifetime (alternatively - if she dies, he inherits her);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one embarrassed or wounded her, the payments are hers;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah ben Beseira says, for damage to a covered part of the body, she receives two thirds of the payment and he gets a third. For damage to an exposed part, she receives a third and he gets two thirds.</p></div>
