<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IF THE VOW WAS UNDONE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's source (that a vow made in public cannot be annulled)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Bnei Yisrael did not kill them (the Giv'onim) because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered (in front of) many?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is three, like we expound regarding Zivah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"(If a woman sees blood) many days" - "days" teaches two; "many" teaches a third.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yitzchak):</span> It is 10. It says "Edah" (like it says regarding the 10 evil Meraglim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>(Mishnah - R. Meir) If the vow can be annulled only by a Chacham, he may not remarry her. If the husband can annul it, he may remarry her;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Elazar says, we forbade him to remarry her when a Chacham is needed only due to the case when a Chacham is not needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of their dispute?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir holds that a man does not mind if his wife is shamed by going to Beis Din. (Perhaps he will say that had he known that a Chacham can permit her vow he would not have divorced her, so the Get is invalid. We decree that he can never remarry her, so he will not divorce before investigating all possibilities. There is no concern for a vow he could have annulled by himself. Surely he knew this, and decided to divorce her anyway);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar holds that a man does not want his wife to be shamed by going to Beis Din. (Even had he known that a Chacham can permit her, he would have divorced her. The only concern for an invalid Get is if he did not know that he could have annulled it himself. We decree about a vow that needs a Chacham due to the case of a vow he could have permitted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to 3:d, 74B - Rava):</span> Beraisa #2 (which says that she is not Mekudeshes if a Chacham permitted her vow) discusses a woman from an important family.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The husband does not want the Kidushin to take effect, lest he be forced to give to her a Get and become forbidden to her relatives (perhaps he would have wanted to marry one of them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If he went to a Chacham and annulled his vow or to a doctor and he removed his Mum, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Seifa should similarly discuss a man from an important family and say that she is not Mekudeshes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A woman wants to be married in any case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> A woman says, 'It is better to live as two (i.e. married) than to live (alone) like a widow.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Even a woman married to an ant (a midget) puts her chair among the important women.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Even if her husband cleans wool (a scorned profession), she goes out on the porch to greet him (she is not ashamed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Even if he is from a bad family, she will not even request lentils (a simple accompaniment for her bread, for it suffices for her that she is married).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All women married to such men have Znus, and attribute the child to their husbands.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>MUMIM</i> THAT INVALIDATE <i>KIDUSHIN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Mumim that disqualify (a Kohen)...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They added the following Mumim: sweat, a wart, and bad breath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> These also disqualify a Kohen!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An animal that is old, Mezuham (sweaty) or sick (is a Ba'al Mum).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> These disqualify a Kohen, whether they are permanent or temporary.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> Sweat disqualifies a Kohen only if it cannot be washed away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Mezuham (odorous) is different that sweat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sweat can be washed away with wine vinegar, so it does not disqualify a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also bad breath is not a Mum. He can put a pepper in his mouth and serve!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>These remedies do not suffice for a wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of the wart?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it has hair, it disqualifies also a Kohen!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it does not have hair but it is big, it disqualifies also a Kohen!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If it does not have hair and is small, it does not disqualify a Kohen or a wife!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A wart with hair is a Mum. If it has no hair, it is a Mum only if it is big.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered big?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> The size of an Italian Isar (a coin) is big.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> The wart (is small and has no hair, but it) is on her forehead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, he saw it and accepted it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It is under her kerchief. Sometimes it is seen, and sometimes not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a dog bit her and a scar remains, this is a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A deep voice is a Mum - "Your voice is pleasant and your form is beautiful".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nasan Birah):</span> A handbreadth between the breasts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> This is an ideal amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> No, the Beraisa teaches that this is a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the proper amount?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is three fingers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> If her breasts are bigger than other women's, this is a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much bigger is a Mum?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Maisha bar brei d'R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> A handbreadth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this ever the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! Rabah bar bar Chanah saw an Arab woman bend her breasts in back of her and nurse her child.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Maisha):</span> "It will be said, Ish v'Ish were born in Tziyon" - this applies equally to one born there, and one who anticipates seeing it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One person born there is like two of us.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One of us who goes there is like two of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In Bavel, R. Yirmiyah did not understand the Rabanan. After going to Eretz Yisrael, he calls us 'foolish Babylonians'.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN IN DOUBT WHEN THE <i>MUMIM</i> AROSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If she had Mumim in her father's house, the father must prove (to collect a Kesuvah) that they came after Kidushin, and the husband's field (wife) got spoiled;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she entered the husband's Reshus and Mumim were found, the husband must prove (to be exempt from paying a Kesuvah) that they came before Kidushin, and the Kidushin was invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say that this applies only to Mumim in covered places. The husband has no claim about Mumim in exposed places.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">75b----------------------------------------75b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If there is a bathhouse in the city, he has no claim even about Mumim in hidden places, since he checks her through his female relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> (In the Reisha) if the father does not bring proof, the husband is believed. This is like R. Yehoshua, who says that a woman is not believed (to say that she was a Besulah at the time of Kidushin, and was raped later - 12b);.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Seifa, if the husband does not bring proof, the father is believed. This is like R. Gamliel, who says that she is believed (about this)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> We are forced to say that different Tana'im said these two clauses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Don't say that R. Yehoshua never follows Chazakah of the body. This is only when Chazakah of money opposes it. If not, he follows it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the bright patch (Tzara'as) appeared and later a white hair developed inside, this makes him Muchlat (absolutely Tamei). If the white hair came first, he is not Muchlat. If we are in doubt, which came first, he is Muchlat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehoshua says, Kehah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> (It is as if) it became weaker; he is Tahor (not Muchlat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> One Tana taught the entire Mishnah. In the Reisha the Mumim were found by the father, so we assume that they were there from the beginning. In the Seifa the Mumim were found by the husband, so we assume they came when she was already married to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If she entered the husband's Reshus, he must prove that the Mumim arose before Kidushin, invalidating the Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It does not suffice to prove that the Mumim were there after Kidushin in her father's house. According to Rava, if they were found by the father, we assume that they were there from the beginning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If he proves that the Mumim were there during Eirusin, we have a Chazakah, a man does not drink a cup (marry a woman) before he checks it! Certainly, he saw the Mum and accepted it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the same applies even if the Mum preceded the Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We have a Chazakah, a man does not accept Mumim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the same applies when the Mum was seen after Kidushin in her father's house!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When the Mum was seen after Kidushin, two Chazakos oppose the husband: of her body (she was born without Mumim), and a man does not drink a cup before he checks it, and he accepted the Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that that a man does not accept Mumim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is one Chazakah. It does not override two Chazakos.</p>
