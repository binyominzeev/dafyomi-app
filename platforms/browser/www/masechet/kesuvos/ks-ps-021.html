<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>VALIDATION OF A DOCUMENT (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> According to Rebbi, witnesses testify about their own signatures. According to Chachamim, they testify about the content of the document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Rebbi is unsure whether the witnesses testify about their own signatures or about the content of the document.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Rebbi was unsure, this would affect the law if one witness died. Rebbi would require two witnesses to testify about his signature.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It would not suffice for the live witness and another person to testify about the signatures.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If so, the live witness would (perhaps) be giving three fourths of the testimony. (Perhaps when he verifies his signature he testifies alone about the content of the document, and he also helps to confirm the other signature.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi would be stringent in this case, and also stringent in the case of the Mishnah (when each confirms only his own signature).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Therefore, we needed to teach that Rebbi is sure that they testify about their signatures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one of the witnesses dies, two others are needed to confirm his signature.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In this case Rebbi is more lenient than Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What can we do if there is only one other who recognizes his signature (in addition to the live witness)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The live witness should write his name on a piece of pottery and give it to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Now we do not need him to confirm his own signature, so he may help confirm the other signature.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>He should sign specifically on pottery, but not on a parchment, lest a corrupt person find it, and write like he pleases above the signature.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven signed a document saying that he owes Shimon, Shimon collects from unsold property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he need to say this? The Halachah (normally) follows the majority!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Halachah (normally) follows Rebbi when he argues with one Tana. One might have thought that the Halachah follows him even against a majority!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chinena bar Chiya):</span> Did Shmuel really say that the Halachah follows Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There was a document validated in Shmuel's Beis Din that said that both witnesses confirmed both signatures!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> That document was of orphans;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel was extra careful to validate it in such a way that even if a Beis Din will mistakenly think that <i>here</i> the Halachah follows Rebbi against a majority, they will still accept the validation.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>VALIDATION OF A VALIDATED DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> A witness may join a judge. (If someone claims that a validated document was forged, it suffices for one witness to confirm his signature and one of the validating judges to confirm his signature.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rami bar Chama:</span> What a wonderful teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> No! They do not join, since they testify about different matters! (This is like Chachamim, who say that a witness testifies about the content of the document.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rami bar Yechezkel:</span> Do not heed these rules that my brother (Rav Yehudah) quotes in the name of Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Ravnoy citing Shmuel):</span> A witness may join a judge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Ameimar:</span> What a wonderful teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Because your grandfather (Rami bar Chama) praised it, also you praise it? Rava refuted it!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>JUDGES WHO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNATURES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Safra quoting R. Aba):</span> If three judges sat to validate a document and two of them recognize the signatures, before the two sign they testify about the signatures in front of the third judge. Then, all three sign the validation;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the two judges signed before testifying, they may not testify to enable the third judge to sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The <i>text</i> of the validation may be written before the testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Papi taught that a validation that was written before testimony on the signatures is invalid, since it appears false;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here too, it appears false (to write that all three judges knew the signatures before the third heard testimony)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the two judges testify before writing the validation. If it was already written, they may not testify to enable the third judge to sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>We learn three laws from this teaching;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A witness can act like a judge after testifying.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the judges recognize the signatures, there is no need to testify in front of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the judges do not recognize the signatures, testimony must be given in front of all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> I agree that we learn that a witness can become a judge (1);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, we cannot learn that if the judges recognize the signatures, there is no need to testify in front of them (2). In R. Aba's case, there is some testimony in front of the third judge!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, we cannot learn that if the judges do not recognize the signatures, testimony must be given in front of all of them (3). R. Aba's case is different. If we do not testify in front of the third judge, no testimony is given at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Safra to R. Aba - Mishnah):</span> If three members of the Beis Din that determines Rosh Chodesh saw the new moon, two of them stand. They seat two other judges of the Beis Din by the third, and the first two testify in front of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An individual cannot declare the new month. Rather, all three declare it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a witness could become a judge, (they would not need two more judges. Two would testify in front of the third, and) the three who saw could declare the new month!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba citing Rav):</span> Declaration of the new month is mid'Oraisa, so for this a witness cannot become a judge. Validation of documents is mid'Rabanan, so for this a witness can become a judge.</p>
