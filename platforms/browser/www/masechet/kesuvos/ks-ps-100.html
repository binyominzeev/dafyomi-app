<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>SHALI'ACH</i> WHO ERRED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Whom does a Shali'ach resemble?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> He is like Beis Din (if he errs less than a sixth, the sale stands).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Shmuel bar Bisna):</span> He is like a widow (any error invalidates the sale).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava said that he is like Beis Din because he does not sell for himself, similar to Beis Din. A widow sells for herself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Shmuel bar Bisna said that he is like a widow, since also he is an individual. Beis Din is a Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Halachah is, a Shali'ach is like a widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Shali'ach was told to take Terumah, he should take like the owner wants. If he does not know, he should take like an average person, one part in 50. If he took one in 40 or one in 60, the separation is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Some people take Terumah generously (one in 40) and some take stingily (one in 60). The Shali'ach can say that he estimated that this is what the owner wanted to give. Regarding a sale it is a pure error. The owner can say 'you should not have erred.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A MISTAKE OF <i>BEIS DIN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere Rav Nachman is concerned for the power of Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> If orphans come to divide their father's property, Beis Din appoints an overseer for them and they select a nice portion for them. When the orphans grow up, they can demand a new division;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman himself):</span> They cannot demand a new division. If they could, Beis Din would be weak!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Nachman is concerned for the power of Beis Din only when they did not err.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they did not err, why can the orphans protest (according to Shmuel)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (They did not err about the value.) They erred about location (e.g. an orphan received a portion far from property that he inherited from his mother's father).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Dimi):</span> A case occurred, and Rebbi ruled like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Parta:</span> If so, Beis Din is weak!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi reversed his ruling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Safra):</span> A case occurred, and Rebbi was about to rule like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Parta:</span> If so, Beis Din is weak!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi ruled like R. Shimon ben Gamliel. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Dimi holds that if one erred in Devar Mishnah (a clearly decided Halachah) we retract the ruling. Rav Safra holds that we do not retract the ruling.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all hold that we retract the ruling. They argue about the case that occurred.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> When a widow sells property, the orphans have Acharayos (to compensate the buyer if the land turns out to be stolen if a creditor takes it). The same applies when Beis Din sells property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case of the widow is obvious, but the case of Beis Din is a Chidush;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">100b----------------------------------------100b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that one who buys from Beis Din assumes that there has been enough publicity (and it would have become known if the land was stolen or has a lien against it), and buys without Acharayos. Rav Yosef teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> The sale stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Up to how much of a mistake can Beis Din make (and the sale stands)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna bar Yehudah):</span> They can err up to half the value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If Beis Din sold a field worth 200 for 100, or a field worth 100 for 200, the sale stands.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE AUCTION OF <i>BEIS</i> <i>DIN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> If Beis Din sold property without auctioning it, this is like a clear mistake, and the sale is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is not just <i>like</i> a clear mistake. It is a clear mistake!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The auction of the property of orphans is 30 days. The auction of Hekdesh property is 60 days. Announcements are made morning and evening.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Mishnah discusses only a Shali'ach who sells, but Beis Din does not need to announce. Ameimar teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> If an assessment of Beis Din was a sixth too little or too much, the sale is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the property was sold for the correct price, the sale would stand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, no announcement was made.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, the property was auctioned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Since the Seifa discusses when it was auctioned, the Reisha discusses when it was not auctioned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If a letter of investigation was done, even if they sold a field worth 100 for 200, or worth 200 for 100, the sale stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, there was no auction. The Reisha discusses property that is not auctioned. The Seifa discusses property that is auctioned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The following are not auctioned:</span> slaves, Metaltelim, and documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We do not auction slaves, lest they run away. We do not auction Metaltelim and documents, lest people steal them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Reisha discusses a time when property is not auctioned; the Seifa discusses a time when it is auctioned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Nehardai):</span> We do not auction to pay for head-tax, food or burial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> The Reisha discusses a place where property is not auctioned; the Seifa discusses a place where it is auctioned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Property was never auctioned in Nehardai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> This is because they were expert assessors.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Yosef bar Minyomi citing Rav Nachman):</span> No, it is because people who bought auctioned property were scorned (for capitalizing on the plight of orphans).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> We assess and sell Metaltelim of orphans immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> We (wait to) sell it in the markets.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They do not argue. We wait only if the market day is coming soon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav Kahana had beer of an orphan; he waited to sell it until the festival.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though it would soon turn to vinegar, it was better to sell at the festival, when people pay cash (as opposed to credit).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Ravina was overseeing wine of an orphan. He was taking his own wine abroad (to sell it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> May I take the orphan's wine also?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Yes. You need not be more careful with it than with your own.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WOMEN WHO HAVE NO <i>KESUVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following have no Kesuvah, Peiros, food, or Bala'os (remnants (Rashi) or compensation for depreciation (Tosfos) of property she brought into the marriage):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A minor who did Mi'un (decided to leave her mid'Rabanan marriage);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Sheniyah (a relative forbidden mid'Rabanan);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>An Ailonis (a girl who does not develop like a normal female).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If he knew that she was an Ailonis when he married her, she receives a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">The following have a Kesuvah:</span> a widow married to a Kohen Gadol, a divorcee or Chalutzah to a regular Kohen, a Mamzeres or Nesinah to a Yisrael, and a Bas Yisrael to a Nasin or Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> The text of the Mishnah says that a minor (who was married mid'Rabanan) has no Kesuvah if she was divorced. All the more so one who does Mi'un has no Kesuvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah says that one who did Mi'un has no Kesuvah. If she was divorced, she gets a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This is like Shmuel taught elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A Mema'enes gets no Kesuvah. A minor (married mid'Rabanan) who was divorced receives a Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she did Mi'un, she is not disqualified from marrying the brothers or a Kohen. If she was divorced, she is disqualified from marrying them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If she did Mi'un, she need not wait three months before remarrying. If she was divorced, she must wait three months before remarrying.</p>
