<p class="dedicationbox">KESUVOS 57 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MAY A COUPLE LIVE TOGETHER WITHOUT A <i>KESUVAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rami bar Chama's sister was married to Rav Avya. She lost her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Rav Yehudah cited Shmuel to say that R. Meir holds that she must have a Kesuvah of 200 (to cohabit with her husband), but Chachamim permit a man to keep his wife for two or three years without a Kesuvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Rav Nachman cited Shmuel to say that the Halachah follows R. Meir's decrees!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rav Yosef):</span> If so, he must write for her another Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN CAN SHE PARDON THE <i>KESUVAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi says that the Tana'im (R. Yosi and R. Yehudah) agree that at the end, she cannot pardon the Kesuvah (verbally, without writing). They argue about (whether she can do so) at the beginning (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yochanan said that they argue in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> R. Yochanan told me that he does not argue with R. Yehoshua ben Levi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehoshua ben Levi calls the start of Chupah 'the beginning', and the end of Bi'ah 'the end.' R. Yochanan said they argue at the start and end of Chupah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The end of Chupah is the start of Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi said that the Tana'im argue at the end. At the beginning, they agree that she can pardon the Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yochanan said that they argue in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> R. Yochanan told me that he does not disagree with R. Yehoshua ben Levi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehoshua ben Levi calls the start of Chupah 'the beginning', and the end of Chupah 'the end.' R. Yochanan said they argue at the start and end of Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Had R. Avahu not explained thusly, I would have said that R. Yochanan and R. Yehoshua ben Levi argue with each other, but Rav Dimi and Ravin do not argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ravin calls the end of Chupah 'the end', and Rav Dimi calls the start of Bi'ah 'the beginning'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rav Papa teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to say that two Amora'im (R. Yehoshua ben Levi and R. Yochanan) argue based on their own reasons, than to say that two Amora'im (Rav Dimi and Ravin) argue about what another Amora said.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE TIME TO PREPARE FOR <i>CHUPAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We give a virgin 12 months to prepare for Chupah from when the husband asks to make Nisu'in. Just like we give time to her, he is given time (from when she asks). We give to a widow 30 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the time came and they were not married, he must feed her. She may eat Terumah (if he is a Kohen);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Tarfon says, he may give to her only Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Akiva says, he gives half Terumah and half Chulin (regular food, for her to eat when she is Temei'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If her husband died and she is Shomeres Yavam (awaiting Yibum), she may not eat Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she was an Arusah for six months and Shomeres Yavam for six months, or a full year less one day Arusah and one day Shomeres Yavam, or vice-versa, she may not eat Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This is the first version of the Mishnah. A later Beis Din decreed that she may not eat Terumah until Chupah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">57b----------------------------------------57b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of a year to prepare for Chupah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> "Let her (Rivkah) stay with us Yamim (days) or 10".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "Yamim" means two days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is not normal to request two, and if this is not granted, to request 10!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, it means a year - "It may be redeemed for <i>Yamim</i>".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is a month - "Ad Chodesh Yamim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to learn Stam (unspecified) Yamim from Stam Yamim, and not from "Chodesh Yamim".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> A minor or her father may delay the Chupah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she wants to go to Chupah, why should her father object?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He reasons that she does not know that she will not be happy, and he will have to marry her off again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Levi):</span> We do not arrange to make Nisu'in for a minor, but we may arrange Nisu'in (Rashi - without Kidushin) for her now for when she grows up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously this is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we are concerned lest she will become weak from fright. R. Aba teaches that we are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>TIME FOR A <i>BOGERES</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If a Bogeres became Mekudeshes, we allow her 30 days, like a widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If she became a Bogeres, it is as if the husband asked to have Chupah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is like a virgin being asked (and she has 12 months)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is like a widow being asked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If a Bogeres was Mekudeshes for 12 months, since now her husband must feed her, he can annul her vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that she has 12 months to prepare!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It means, a Bogeres <i>or</i> one who has waited 12 months...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was Mekadesh a virgin, whether he asks and she delays or vice-versa, we give 12 months from the request, not from the Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Becoming a Bogeres is like being asked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she was Bogeres for one day and became Mekudeshes, she gets 12 months. An Arusah gets 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Huna is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'an Arusah gets 30 days'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> If she was a Bogeres for 12 months and became an Arusah, she gets 30 days, like a widow.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHY <i>ARUSOS</i> MAY NOT EAT <i>TERUMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Mid'Oraisa, a Bas Yisrael Mekudeshes to a Kohen may eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"A Kohen who acquires a soul through money" - an Arusah can be acquired with money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Ula):</span> Mid'Rabanan, she may not eat Terumah lest they mix a cup of Terumah wine for her, and she will give to her siblings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This concern applies even after the time for Chupah comes (yet the original Mishnah permits her after this time)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When the time comes, he designates a place for her (away from her family).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If this is a concern, a Kohen farmhand living with a Yisrael should not eat Terumah, lest they come to eat with him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They give him to eat. Surely they will not they eat from him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> An Arusah may not eat, lest she has a Mum that will invalidate the marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even after Chupah, if they did not yet have Bi'ah she should be forbidden to eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The husband checks her (through his female relatives) before Chupah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same concern should apply to a slave bought from a Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mumim in a slave do not invalidate the sale:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they are visible, the buyer saw them (and wanted the slave anyway)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they are covered, since the slave is needed only for labor, the master doesn't care about them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the slave is found to be a thief or gambler, the sale is valid (for this is normal for slaves).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the slave is an armed robber, or the kingdom sentenced him to be executed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Such matters become known. (Rashi - the buyer cannot retract. R. Tam - he can retract, but it is rare to buy such slaves, so we are not concerned for this.)</p>
