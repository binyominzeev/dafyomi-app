<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MUST THE LAST WOMAN SWEAR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the basis of the argument (about whether or not the last woman must swear)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> The case is, (after three women collected they found out that) one of the husband's fields was not really his. They argue about whether or not collection out of order (a later creditor before an earlier creditor) is a valid collection;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana holds that the collection is invalid (so there is no harm if the fourth woman collects without an oath). Ben Nanas holds that the collection stands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> (The case is, they found out that one of the husband's fields was not really his.) All agree that collection out of order is invalid. They argue about whether or not we are concerned lest the fourth woman decrease the value of the field.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana is not concerned. Ben Nanas is concerned (for she expects that it will be taken from her).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> (The case is, adult orphans want the fourth woman to swear.) They argue about Abaye Kashisha's law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye Kashisha):</span> The orphans (to whom one must swear to collect from them) are adults, and all the more so, minors.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The first Tana holds (that one need not swear to adults,) unlike with Abaye Kashisha. Ben Nanas holds like Abaye Kashisha.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If two brothers or partners have a case against someone, and one of them took him to Beis Din and received a verdict, the other brother or partner cannot say 'I was not party to that ruling.' Rather, his partner acted on his behalf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support  (Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> The first woman swears to the second, and the second to the third, but the first need not swear to the third.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is because when the second made the first swear, she acted on behalf of the third woman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is because an oath to one is like an oath to 100;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In Rav Huna's case, the partner could say that he would have argued better.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is only if the partner was not in the city. If he was in the city, he should have come to Beis Din. (By not coming, he accepts whatever verdict his partner receives.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TWO DOCUMENTS WITH THE SAME DATE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If two documents (of sale (Tosfos - or gift) for the same property) have the same date, the recipients split the property.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We apply Shuda (Rashi - we estimate to whom he wanted to sell the property; Tosfos - the judges give it to whichever they want).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav holds like R. Meir, who says that the witnesses who sign on a document empower it (therefore, both documents take effect simultaneously from the date written). Shmuel holds like R. Elazar, who says that the witnesses who see a document given to the recipient empower it (therefore, only the one that was given first is valid).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">94b----------------------------------------94b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all hold like R. Elazar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav holds that it is better to divide the property. Shmuel holds that Shuda is better.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav does not hold like R. Elazar!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Elazar in Gitin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Elazar even regarding monetary documents.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Rav does not hold like R. Elazar regarding monetary documents.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that Rav holds like R. Meir, and Shmuel holds like R. Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> If two documents have the same date, they divide the property!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Meir. Shmuel holds like R. Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> If he wrote to Levi, and then wrote and gave over to David, David acquires.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is like R. Meir, why does (only) David acquire? He holds that the witnesses who sign empower the document (both should acquire equally)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> (The Beraisa is like R. Elazar.) Tana'im argue about whether division or Shuda is better;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> (If Reuven sent a gift to Shimon, and Shimon died before the gift reached him and Reuven died before the gift returned,) the heirs of Reuven and Shimon divide the property;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Here (in Bavel) they said the Shali'ach does as he wants (i.e. Shuda).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Rami bar Chama's mother wrote her property to him in the morning. In the afternoon, she wrote it to Mar Ukva bar Chama. Rami bar Chama went to Rav Sheshes, who ruled that Rami bar Chama receives the property. Mar Ukva bar Chama went to Rav Nachman, and he ruled in his favor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> Why did you rule like you did?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Why did you rule like you did?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> Rami's document was written first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> We care which document was written earlier in the day only in Yerushalayim (where they write the hour in the document)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> Why did you rule like you did?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> The Halachah is Shuda. I ruled based on my estimation (or preference).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> My ruling may also be considered Shuda!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> No. Firstly, I am ordained to judge by the Exilarch and the Yeshivah, and you are not.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Secondly, your ruling was not intended to be Shuda.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A DOCUMENT WITH A VAGUE DATE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Two sale documents for the same property came in front of Rav Yosef. Reuven's was dated Nisan 5. Shimon's said only 'Nisan'. Rav Yosef gave the property to Reuven.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> Why should I lose?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> You have the lower hand. Perhaps your document was given on Nisan 29.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> (I bought with Acharayos.) Write for me a document authorizing me to take property (for compensation) sold from Iyar and onwards.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Buyers can dispel you. Perhaps your document is from Nisan 1, and you deserved the property given to Reuven!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The solution is for Reuven to give to Shimon power of attorney to collect from buyers.</p></div>
