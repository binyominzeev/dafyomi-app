<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHO BURIES A <i>SHOMERES</i> <i>YAVAM</i>? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> A widow is fed from the orphans' property. They receive her earnings, and need not bury her. Her heirs who inherit her Kesuvah must bury her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which widow has two sets of heirs? (The Mishnah needed to specify which heirs, i.e. those who inherit her Kesuvah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Shomeres Yavam.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why can't the Yavam say 'I inherit my brother (including the 200 Zuz he was prepared to pay if necessary. I do not inherit a dowry from her, so) I will not bury his wife'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Her heirs can force him to accept one of the following terms:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do you say 'I inherit my brother (and the Kesuvah was never due to be paid, for I am in place of him, so it is as if she died first)'? If so, you must bury her (like he would have had to bury her)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If you will not bury her, you must pay her Kesuvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> (He need not accept either of these. Even though he is not totally like his brother,) her Kesuvah was never due to be paid in his brother's lifetime (because she was never permitted to marry someone else)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Only Beis Shamai expound the text of the Kesuvah (that it is due to be paid only when she may remarry). They consider a document destined to be collected as if it was collected!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If a Sotah's husband died before she drank, she receives her Kesuvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, either she drinks or does not receive her Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> She cannot drink, for we cannot fulfill "The man will bring his wife"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, since she does not drink, she does not receive a Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Beis Shamai say that she receives her Kesuvah? Her claim to a Kesuvah is Safek (if she is guilty she deserves nothing), but his heirs surely inherit!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Shamai consider a document destined to be collected as if it was collected.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do they consider the Kesuvah as if it was collected? The Kesuvah says 'When you will (be permitted to) marry another (man), you will collect.' A Shomeres Yavam cannot marry another!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The Yavam is considered 'another'.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IS THE KESUVAH CONSIDERED TO BE COLLECTED IN HIS LIEFTIME?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava, against Abaye):</span> A Kesuvah is not considered to be collected in the lifetime of the Yavam!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Aba):</span> If a Yavam wants to sell property that he inherited from his brother:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he is a Kohen, he should appease his wife so she will agree;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If he is a Yisrael, he can divorce her and remarry her.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">81b----------------------------------------81b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we consider the Kesuvah to be collected in his lifetime, he could designate an amount sufficient to pay the Kesuvah and sell the rest!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question (Abaye):</span> Why didn't you ask from the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He (a Yavam) should not tell her 'Your Kesuvah is on the table.' Rather, there is a lien on all his property to pay the Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is merely good advice (Ri - lest he be quick to divorce her; Rashba - lest he be unable to spend the money; Rashi - lest he spend it and need to write a new Kesuvah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> Similarly, a man should not tell his wife 'Your Kesuvah is on the table.' Rather, there is a lien on all his property to pay the Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Surely a married man can sell his property! Rather, this is just advice. Also regarding the Yavam, it is just advice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Beraisa is still difficult (if he could designate enough for the Kesuvah, surely this is better than divorcing her)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also that is good advice, to avoid resentment. (Designating money for the Kesuvah makes it look like he plans to divorce her. If he divorces her and immediately remarries her, she realizes that this was only to be able to use the money.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CAN A YAVAM SELL THE PROPERTY OF THE DECEASED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A woman fell to Yibum in Pumbedisa. Levi planned to give to her a Get (which forbids her mid'Rabanan to all the brothers), to prevent his older brother Reuven from doing Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> Do you seek to prevent me from (doing Yibum and) inheriting our brother's property myself? I will split it with you!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Since Chachamim said that the property may not be sold, Reuven's sale (or gift) is void.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman fell to Yibum, even if the Mes left 100 Maneh and the Kesuvah is only one Maneh, there is a lien on all the property. The Yavam may not sell any of it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Sometimes Chachamim forbade selling, but b'Di'eved the sale is valid!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> (If property fell to an Arusah,) she may sell it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, she may not sell it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They agree that if she sold or gave it, the sale or gift stands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina bar Papi):</span> Rav Yosef's ruling is correct.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> What good is his answer? He did not give any reason!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rav Minyomi brei d'Rav Nechumi agreed with Abaye, but asked if Rav Yosef could find support for his ruling.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Yosef for himself - Beraisa):</span> Reuven owed money to his brother Levi. Levi died and his wife fell to Yibum. Reuven cannot say 'since I inherit, the money will stay by me.' Rather, we take the money from him, buy land with it, and he eats the Peiros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Perhaps the Beraisa is merely good advice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It says 'we take from him.' You cannot say that this is just good advice!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Minyomi:</span> Rav Nachman said that this Beraisa is erroneous.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is wrong?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A loan is like Metaltelim, and a Kesuvah is not collected from Metaltelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Beraisa is like R. Meir, who says that a Kesuvah is collected from Metaltelim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He can say to her 'you have no claim against me.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Beraisa is like R. Nasan!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> "v'Nasan la'Asher Asham Lo (to whom the principal belongs)" teaches that if Shimon owes to David and David to Moshe, we take from Shimon to pay Moshe.</p></div>
