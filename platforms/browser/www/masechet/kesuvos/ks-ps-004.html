<p class="dedicationbox">KESUVOS 4 (17 Shevat) - Dedicated by Mrs. Idelle Rudman in memory of Harav Reuven Moshe Rudman ben Harav Yosef Tuvia Rudman, who passed away 17 Shevat 5766, in honor of his ninth Yahrzeit. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE CHUPAH THAT PUSHES OFF AVEILUS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the bread was baked, the animals were slaughtered, or the wine was mixed, and then the Chasan's father or Kalah's mother died:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We put the deceased in a room until after the Chupah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They have Bi'as Mitzvah, and separate;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They celebrate the seven days of festivity (of newlyweds), followed by seven days of Aveilus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>All 14 days he sleeps among men, and she sleeps among women.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>She may use any cosmetics she desires during the 30 days of Aveilus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>All this applies only when the Chasan's father or Kalah's mother died, for no one else will toil to prepare another Chupah. If his mother or her father died, the burial and Aveilus precede the Chupah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Permission to postpone the burial and Aveilus due to having slaughtered animals applies only if water was put on the meat. If not, the meat can be sold;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> In a large city, even if water was put on the meat, it can be sold (so we must delay the Chupah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> In a village, even if water was not put on the meat, it cannot be sold (so we may delay the burial and Aveilus).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, where does Rav Chisda's law apply?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It applies in a middle-sized city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>A Beraisa supports Rav Chisda.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Similarly, if the Kalah becomes Nidah, he sleeps among men, and she sleeps among women.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Whether or not there is an Ones, the first act of Bi'ah may not be on Shabbos night nor Saturday night.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SEPARATION OF THE KALAH AND CHASAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He sleeps among men, and she sleeps among women.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This supports R. Yochanan, who says that even though we do not show signs of Aveilus on a festival (a Chasan has the same law as a festival), private matters (i.e. Bi'ah) are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef brei d'Rava):</span> They must sleep (separately) with other men and women only if they have not yet had Bi'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa says that they sleep separately, even though they have had Bi'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yosef discusses only when she became Nidah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says 'similarly' (which connotes that the cases are identical)!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means 'similarly, if a Kalah became Nidah before they had Bi'ah, they sleep among men/women.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>We are more stringent about Aveilus than about Nidah. We must say that a Chasan is less than careful to refrain from Bi'ah during Aveilus than to refrain from Bi'ah with a Nidah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak bar Chanina):</span> A Nidah may do everything a woman does for her husband, except for mixing his drink, making his bed, and washing his face, hands and feet. (This is more stringent than regarding Aveilus!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even though a man cannot force his wife to color her eyes and be Pokeses (apply rouge to her face; alternatively, part her hair) during her Aveilus, she may mix his drink, make his bed, and wash his face, hands and feet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That refers to her Aveilus. The restrictions of a man during his own Aveilus are more stringent than those of a Nidah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that they sleep among men and women, whether his father or her mother died!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We postpone burial and Aveilus (even) when her mother died, but sleeping among men/women applies only when his father died.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is no difference between his Aveilus and hers!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman lost a parent, her husband cannot force her to color her eyes and be Pokeses. Rather, he inverts his bed and mourns with her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Similarly, if a man lost a parent, his wife may not color her eyes or be Pokeses. Rather, she inverts her bed and mourns with him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> During his Aveilus, they sleep among men/women.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says 'similarly'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to coloring eyes and being Pokeses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that she mourns with him. This connotes in the same bed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means in his presence;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The wife of Rav's son Chiya was mourning. Rav told him to conduct like an Avel only in front of her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (i) - Rav Ashi):</span> Normally, a person is careful about Aveilus. Here we were lenient, so we must add stringencies so he will not treat it lightly.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE LENIENCY OF THIS AVEILUS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the leniency of this Aveilus?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They may have Bi'ah before the burial.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is not a leniency. Aveilus did not begin yet!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Eliezer says that Aveilus begins when the coffin leaves the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says that Aveilus begins from the sealing of the coffin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The leniency is that the week of Aveilus is postponed until after the seven days of festivities.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Whether or not there is an Ones, the first Bi'ah may not be on Shabbos night nor Saturday night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Shabbos night is forbidden because he makes a wound;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Why is Saturday night forbidden?</p></div>
