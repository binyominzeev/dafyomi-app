<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE CHUPAH THAT PUSHES OFF AVEILUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the bread was baked, the animals were slaughtered, or the wine was mixed, and then the Chasan's father or Kalah's mother died:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We put the deceased in a room until after the Chupah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They have Bi'as Mitzvah, and separate;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They celebrate the seven days of festivity (of newlyweds), followed by seven days of Aveilus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>All 14 days he sleeps among men, and she sleeps among women.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>She may use any cosmetics she desires during the 30 days of Aveilus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>All this applies only when the Chasan's father or Kalah's mother died, for no one else will toil to prepare another Chupah. If his mother or her father died, the burial and Aveilus precede the Chupah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Permission to postpone the burial and Aveilus due to having slaughtered animals applies only if water was put on the meat. If not, the meat can be sold;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> In a large city, even if water was put on the meat, it can be sold (so we must delay the Chupah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> In a village, even if water was not put on the meat, it cannot be sold (so we may delay the burial and Aveilus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, where does Rav Chisda's law apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It applies in a middle-sized city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A Beraisa supports Rav Chisda.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Similarly, if the Kalah becomes Nidah, he sleeps among men, and she sleeps among women.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Whether or not there is an Ones, the first act of Bi'ah may not be on Shabbos night nor Saturday night.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE SEPARATION OF THE KALAH AND CHASAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He sleeps among men, and she sleeps among women.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This supports R. Yochanan, who says that even though we do not show signs of Aveilus on a festival (a Chasan has the same law as a festival), private matters (i.e. Bi'ah) are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef brei d'Rava):</span> They must sleep (separately) with other men and women only if they have not yet had Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa says that they sleep separately, even though they have had Bi'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yosef discusses only when she became Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says 'similarly' (which connotes that the cases are identical)!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means 'similarly, if a Kalah became Nidah before they had Bi'ah, they sleep among men/women.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>We are more stringent about Aveilus than about Nidah. We must say that a Chasan is less than careful to refrain from Bi'ah during Aveilus than to refrain from Bi'ah with a Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak bar Chanina):</span> A Nidah may do everything a woman does for her husband, except for mixing his drink, making his bed, and washing his face, hands and feet. (This is more stringent than regarding Aveilus!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even though a man cannot force his wife to color her eyes and be Pokeses (apply rouge to her face; alternatively, part her hair) during her Aveilus, she may mix his drink, make his bed, and wash his face, hands and feet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That refers to her Aveilus. The restrictions of a man during his own Aveilus are more stringent than those of a Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that they sleep among men and women, whether his father or her mother died!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We postpone burial and Aveilus (even) when her mother died, but sleeping among men/women applies only when his father died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is no difference between his Aveilus and hers!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman lost a parent, her husband cannot force her to color her eyes and be Pokeses. Rather, he inverts his bed and mourns with her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, if a man lost a parent, his wife may not color her eyes or be Pokeses. Rather, she inverts her bed and mourns with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> During his Aveilus, they sleep among men/women.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says 'similarly'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to coloring eyes and being Pokeses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that she mourns with him. This connotes in the same bed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means in his presence;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The wife of Rav's son Chiya was mourning. Rav told him to conduct like an Avel only in front of her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (i) - Rav Ashi):</span> Normally, a person is careful about Aveilus. Here we were lenient, so we must add stringencies so he will not treat it lightly.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE LENIENCY OF THIS AVEILUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the leniency of this Aveilus?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They may have Bi'ah before the burial.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is not a leniency. Aveilus did not begin yet!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Eliezer says that Aveilus begins when the coffin leaves the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yehoshua says that Aveilus begins from the sealing of the coffin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The leniency is that the week of Aveilus is postponed until after the seven days of festivities.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Whether or not there is an Ones, the first Bi'ah may not be on Shabbos night nor Saturday night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Shabbos night is forbidden because he makes a wound;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why is Saturday night forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
