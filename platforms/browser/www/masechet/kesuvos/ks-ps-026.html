<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CHAZAKOS FOR KEHUNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He believed the brother because he spoke l'Fi Tumo (unaware of the consequences of his words):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A man said l'Fi Tumo 'I remember when I was a child... they took me out of school... and immersed me to eat Terumah';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Chiya says that he concluded 'my friends avoided touching me, and called me 'Yochanan who eats Chalah'.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi established him to be a Kohen based on this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Ma'aser Rishon establishes a man to be a Kohen, just like Terumah does. If he takes a portion in Beis Din, this does not establish him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ma'aser Rishon is given to a Levi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana holds like R. Elazar ben Azaryah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> We give Terumah to a Kohen and Ma'aser Rishon to a Levi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar ben Azaryah says, Ma'aser Rishon is given even to a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even R. Elazar ben Azaryah agrees that Ma'aser may be given to a Levi! (How can we establish the man to be a Kohen?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar ben Azaryah holds that after Ezra fined the Leviyim (for not returning to Eretz Yisrael), Ma'aser Rishon is given only to a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it happened to be given to a Levi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> We knew that Yochanan's father was a Kohen. There was a rumor that Yochanan was Pasul for Kehunah because his mother was divorced or did Chalitzah. People saw Yochanan receiving Ma'aser Rishon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is certainly not a Levi! If he was truly a Pasul Kohen, he would not receive Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even the opinion that permits anyone to <i>eat</i> Ma'aser Rishon agrees that it is <i>distributed</i> only to a Levi or Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he takes a portion in Beis Din, this does not establish him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If distribution in Beis Din does not establish him, what does?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Beraisa means: one who receives a share of Terumah with his brothers from his father's estate is not established to be a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that just like the others receive Terumah to eat, also this son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it is possible that he receives Terumah to sell it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A PROTEST THAT A MAN IS NOT A <i>KOHEN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> We do not establish Ploni to be a Kohen based on one witness... (R. Elazar says, when there are no protests, one witness suffices. R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, we establish a Kohen through one witness.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel says the same thing as R. Eliezer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Eliezer holds that even one witness can protest, and R. Shimon ben Gamliel requires two.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan taught that all agree that a protest requires at least two!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, we know that Ploni's father is a Kohen. There was a rumor that Ploni is Pasul (due to his mother), so we demoted him from Kehunah. One witness testified that he is a proper Kohen, and we reinstated him;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Two witnesses came and said that he is Pasul, so we demoted him. Now, a second witness testified that he is a proper Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree that we join witnesses who did not testify together. The question is whether or not we are concerned for disgrace to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The first Tana (R. Eliezer) does not allow a disgrace of Beis Din. Since we demoted him, we do not reinstate him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says that we reinstate him. We are not concerned for the disgrace of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> If so, they would argue even if both witnesses that he is a Kohen came after the two who protested!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> They argue about whether or not we join witnesses who testified separately;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Other Tana'im (R. Nasan and Chachamim) also argue about this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Two witnesses do not join unless they saw the testimony together;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah says, they join even if they saw the testimony at different times.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Two witnesses join only if they testify together;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Nasan says, one can testify today and the other on another day.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A WOMAN TAKEN FOR MONETARY REASONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Nochrim took a woman captive for money (they intend to charge ransom to release her), she is permitted to her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she was taken for a capital offense, she is forbidden to her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> This applies only when Yisrael are in control. If the Nochrim are in control, even when taken for money she is forbidden to her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> R. Yosi ha'Kohen and R. Zecharyah ben ha'Katzav testified about a girl who was taken for collateral for a loan in Ashkelon. Her family distanced themselves from her, even though the witnesses about her abduction said that she was never secluded.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If you believe the witnesses that she was taken for collateral, believe them that she was not secluded! If you do not believe them that she was not secluded, do not believe them that she was abducted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Nochrim are in control in Ashkelon, and it was a problem only because she was taken for collateral. Had she been taken merely for ransom, she would be permitted (even without witnesses that there was no seclusion)!</p>
