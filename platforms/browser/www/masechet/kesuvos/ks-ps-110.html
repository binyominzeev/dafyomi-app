<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Admon):</span> If Reuven shows a document saying that Shimon owes him money and Shimon shows a document that Reuven sold him a field, Shimon can say 'if I owed you money, you should have kept the money as repayment, and not sold to me a field!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Reuven was clever to sell to him land. Now he will be able to collect his debt!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Admon's law is reasonable. Why do Chachamim argue?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In a place where people pay for a field before the document is written, all agree that Shimon can say 'if I owed you money, you should have kept the money as repayment';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue in a place where people pay for a field after the document is written.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Admon holds that Reuven should have told witnesses why he is selling.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim say that everyone has friends. Had Reuven done this, Shimon would have heard and would not have bought the field.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ONE WHO LENT TO HIS CREDITOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Admon):</span> If Reuven shows a document saying that Shimon borrowed from him and Shimon shows a document that Reuven subsequently borrowed from him, Shimon can say 'if I truly owed you money, why did you borrow from me? You should have collected the debt!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, each collects what the other owes him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Nachman):</span> If Reuven and Shimon both show documents saying that the other borrowed from him, each collects what is owed to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> There is no point in paying money and returning it. Rather, each keeps his own.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>All agree that if Reuven and Shimon have the same quality land (both have Idis (top quality), or both Beinonis (medium), or both Ziburis (inferior)), each keeps what he has;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about when one has Beinonis and the other has Ziburis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav Nachman holds that each collects, because he says that a creditor collects from subjective Beinonis (the borrower's middle quality land).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The one with Ziburis receives the other's Beinonis. He then pays with his Ziburis. (He need not return the Beinonis he received, since it is his Idis.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rav Sheshes holds that each keeps his property, because he says that a creditor collects objective Beinonis (medium quality land based on the world standard).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he would collect Beinonis, he would have to return it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Nachman, why does the owner of the Ziburis collect first?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We should let the owner of the Beinonis first collect Ziburis, and he can then return the Ziburis!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the owner of the Ziburis was the first to demand payment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But still, they come to collect at the same time!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, they argue when one has Idis and Beinonis, and the other has Ziburis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Nachman holds that a creditor collects from subjective Beinonis. Rav Sheshes holds that he gets objective Beinonis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Sheshes - Mishnah):</span> Chachamim say that each collects...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman on behalf of Rav Sheshes):</span> The case is, one loan was for 10 years, and the other was for five years.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When were the loans made?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the first was for 10 years, and the second for five, why would Admon say that he should have collected his loan? The collection time didn't come yet!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the first loan was for five years, and the second was for 10.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When was the second loan made?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the first loan was already due to be collected, Chachamim should agree to Admon that if he really owed him, he should have collected the loan!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If the first loan was not yet due, why does Admon say he should have collected it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the second loan was made on the day the first loan was due,</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Chachamim hold that a person would take a loan for one day (i.e. rather than wait to collect his loan at the end of the day). Admon holds that a person would not take a loan for one day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rami bar Chama):</span> The case is, one party died, leaving no land.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>His orphans collect, but a creditor cannot collect from them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Mishnah says that each side collects!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, this one collects, and this one deserves to collect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah says that each collects!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rava):</span> The living creditor can pay land, and collect it again!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If orphans collect land for a debt owed to their father, a creditor of the father can collect that land.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>These are left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The orphans have Ziburis, and the other party has (Idis and) Beinonis. The orphans collect Beinonis, and pay back Ziburis!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even if Beinonis is defined objectively, only Ziburis is collected from orphans!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is only if the creditor did not seize Beinonis. If he seized Beinonis, he keeps it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FORCING ONE'S WIFE TO MOVE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are three regions (of Eretz Yisrael) regarding marriage: Yehudah, east of the Yarden, and Galil. One cannot force his wife to move to a different region.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Within a region one can force his wife to move from one city to another, or from a large city to another large city;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, one cannot force her even from a bad place to a nice place, because living in a nice place tests (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Granted, one cannot force his wife to move from a big city to a city, for everything is found in a big city, but not in a city;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Why can't he force her to move from a city to a big city?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like R. Yosi bar Chanina taught;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> Living in a large city is hard - "They blessed all the people who volunteered to live in Yerushalayim." (It is crowded and there is little air.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Shmuel taught;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel taught that a change in one's routine brings stomach sickness.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Sefer Ben Sira):</span> Even nights (of a poor person are hard). His roof is lowest of the roofs, his vineyard is at the top of the hill.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rain from other roofs falls on his. The soil of his vineyard falls to others.</p></div>

Anyone can force (his household) to move to Yerushalayim. Anyone cannot force them to leave Yerushalayim. This applies to men and women equally.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he married her in Eretz Yisrael and divorced her in Kaputkiya, he pays the Kesuvah in coins of Eretz Yisrael. This shows that he pays coins of the place where he obligated himself;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The Tana holds that Kesuvah is mid'Rabanan, therefore, he is lenient to allow payment of the smaller coins.</p></div>
