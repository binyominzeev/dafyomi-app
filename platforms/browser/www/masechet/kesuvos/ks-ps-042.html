<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHO RECEIVES THE PAYMENTS? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We already learned this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A seducer pays three things and a rapist pays four. A seducer pays embarrassment, blemish and fine, and a rapist also pays for pain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Mishnah teaches that the payments go to the father.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious, since a seducer pays;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the payments were to her, why would he pay? She consented!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Our Mishnah teaches the argument of R. Shimon and Chachamim when the father dies after the trial.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>AN ASHAM FOR A FALSE OATH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(Mishnah) Reuven claimed against Shimon 'You raped (or seduced) my daughter!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> I didn't!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> I impose an oath on you!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> Amen (I accept the oath).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Later, Shimon admitted that he swore falsely. He is liable (to pay the principal and a Chomesh (an added fifth) and to offer an Asham Gezeilos, the Korban for a false oath to deny a debt);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon exempts, since one does not pay a fine due to his admission.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Even so, he pays embarrassment and blemish due to his admission.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Would R. Shimon obligate (a Chomesh and an Asham) in the following case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> You raped (or seduced) my daughter. I took you to trial, and you were obligated to pay!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> That is all false!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> I impose an oath on you!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> Amen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Since there already was a trial, the payment is like regular Mamon (so he is liable);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Or, do we still consider it like a fine (so he pays only the principal)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> It is like Mamon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Reuven claimed 'You raped (or seduced) my daughter', or 'your ox killed my slave';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> That is false!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">A slave (to his master):</span> You knocked out my tooth or blinded my eye!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">His master:</span> I didn't!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Shimon or the master swore falsely and later admitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he is liable (to bring an Asham)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "He denied a deposit, loan or theft... (which are Mamon)" - this excludes these cases, which are fines.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case was already brought to trial.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> No, it was not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since in the Reisha the case already went to trial, surely the same applies to the Seifa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reisha) Question:</span> We know (that one adds a Chomesh and brings an Asham for a false oath) about matters for which one pays (only) the principal. What is the source for a thief who pays double, four or five times the value, a rapist or seducer, and Motzi Shem Ra?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the repetition "u'Mo'alah Ma'al".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If there was not yet a trial, there is no obligation to pay double!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the case went to trial.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Also in the Seifa, the case went to trial</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> The entire Beraisa is R. Shimon. The Reisha is after trial and the Seifa is before trial.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Rabah:	This is a poor answer. If so, 'R. Shimon says' should appear at the beginning or end of the Beraisa (and not in the middle)! I will give you a better answer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> The entire Beraisa is after trial. The Reisha is Chachamim and the Seifa is R. Shimon. I agree that R. Shimon exempts from an Asham due to "He denied a deposit..."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>I said that it is Mamon to teach that the father bequeaths it to his sons.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If she did not collect until the father died, she keeps the payments!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is like money to bequeath to the sons, her brothers should get the money!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE QUESTION IS FINALLY ANSWERED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Rabah and Rav Yosef could not answer this for 22 years. It was only answered when (Rabah died and) Rav Yosef became head of the Yeshivah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The fine of a rapist is different, since the Torah said "<i>v'Nasan</i> (he will give) to the father" - it is not considered the father's until it is given.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rabah said that <i>other</i> fines are Mamon to teach that the sons inherit them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> In the Parashah of a slave killed by an animal it says "<i>Yiten</i> (he will give)." Does the master merit it only after it is paid?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We only learn from the word "<i>v'Nasan"</i>, not from "<i>Yiten"</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> The Beraisa says that we learn from "He denied..." It should say that we learn from "v'Nasan"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "He denied..." teaches about (the exemption from an Asham) when after the trial she became a Bogeres and died. Her father inherits the fine <i>from her</i>. (Therefore, we cannot learn this from "v'Nasan l'Aviha".)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> ... This excludes these cases, which are fines.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it discusses after the trial, they are Mamon!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It means, this excludes these cases which were originally fines.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> R. Shimon exempts (from the Asham) since he does not pay due to his admission.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This applies only before the trial. After the trial he pays due to his admission, so he should bring an Asham!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon addresses the Chachamim according to their reasoning:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> I hold that even after the trial, the Torah exempts from "He denied..." You should agree with me that before the trial the claim is only a fine, and one who admits to a fine is exempt (so no Asham is brought)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say that the father demands payment for embarrassment and blemish (Mamon).</p></div>
