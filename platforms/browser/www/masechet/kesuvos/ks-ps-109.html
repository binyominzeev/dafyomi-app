<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO RETRACTS HIS PROMISE TO GIVE A DOWRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Levi promised to give a certain amount to his son-in-law, and before the Nisu'in he said that he will not (or cannot) give the money; his son-in-law can say that he will not make Nisu'in until Levi gives the money, and Levi's daughter will be unable to marry anyone else;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Admon says, she can claim 'had I promised myself, this would be proper. My father promised. What should I do? Have Nisu'in with me, or divorce me!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> I agree with Admon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Our Mishnah is unlike the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> Admon and Chachamim didn't argue about a man who promised money to his son-in-law, and then retracted. All agree that she can say 'my father promised. What should I do?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue when she promised, and then retracted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say that her husband can say 'I will not make Nisu'in until you give the money';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Admon says, she can say 'I thought that my father would give. Now that I see that he will not (or cannot), what can I do? Have Nisu'in with me, or divorce me!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> I agree with Admon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This (Rashi - the law of this Beraisa; Tosfos - our Mishnah) applies when she is an adult. If she is a minor, we force.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whom do we force?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We force her father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is more reasonable to force him if she is an adult!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We force her husband to divorce her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak ben Elazar):</span> Wherever R. Gamliel agreed with Admon, the Halachah follows Admon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Does this even apply to the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> He did not say 'in the Mishnah.' He said 'wherever'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Regarding the two laws that Chanan said, the Halachah is k'Yotzei Bo (Rashi - like the one who agrees with him; Tosfos - the same applies in similar cases). Regarding the seven laws that Admon said, the Halachah is not k'Yotzei Bo.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Halachah follows Chanan's two laws and k'Yotzei Bo. The Halachah does not follow Admon's seven laws, nor k'Yotzei Bo.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yitzchak ben Elazar said that wherever R. Gamliel agreed with Admon, the Halachah follows Admon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the Halachah follows Chanan's two laws and k'Yotzei Bo. Regarding Admon's seven laws, the Halachah does not follow k'Yotzei Bo.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that the Halachah follows Admon in all seven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yitzchak ben Elazar taught that wherever R. Gamliel said that he agrees with Admon, the Halachah follows Admon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Where R. Gamliel did not say this, the Halachah does not follow Admon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Halachah follows Chanan's two laws and k'Yotzei Bo. Regarding Admon's seven laws, sometimes the Halachah follows him and k'Yotzei Bo. Sometimes, it is not like him, but it is (Tosfos - and it is not) k'Yotzei Bo;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Wherever R. Gamliel agreed with Admon, the Halachah follows Admon. In all other places, it does not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A TACIT ADMISSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Admon):</span> If Reuven claims that Shimon stole a field from him, and Reuven signed on the document in which Levi bought this field from Shimon. Reuven did not forfeit his claim. He signed the document, because he would rather take Levi to trial than Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, he forfeited his claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If a sale document delineates an adjacent field by saying that it borders on Shimon's field, and Reuven signed this document, he forfeits his claim that Shimon stole the field from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Abaye):</span> This applies only to a witness who signs. If a judge signed (validated) such a document, he does not forfeit his claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Witnesses may not sign a document unless they read it, but judges may sign a document even without reading it.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">109b----------------------------------------109b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If this field was used to delineate an adjacent field...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is only if the adjacent field was sold to someone else. If it was for himself (Reuven bought (Rashi) or sold (Tosfos) the field from or to Shimon), he does not forfeit his claim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had Reuven objected to calling the adjacent field Shimon's, the sale would not have gone through.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reuven should have told witnesses that he does not agree that the field is Shimon's!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Everyone has friends. Had Reuven done so, word would have spread, Shimon would have heard and cancelled the sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>David signed a document selling the field north of Levi's field, and later claimed that Levi stole the field (to the south). David died. An Apotropos was appointed for the orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> David forfeited his claim to the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">The Apotropos:</span> If David was alive, he would claim that Levi only owns one furrow's width of the south field, and this was used to delineate the north field. The rest of the south field is mine!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Excellent! We make this claim for the orphans!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If David claims that Levi owns only one furrow's width of the south field, and this was used to delineate the north field, he is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Give to Shimon a furrow's width of the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>There was a row of date trees on the furrow (making the furrow very valuable).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">The Apotropos:</span> If David was alive, he would claim that later he bought back the furrow!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Excellent! We make this claim for the orphans!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If Reuven claims that later he bought it back, he is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> One who appoints an Apotropos should appoint a man like this, who knows how to argue for the orphans!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO LOST THE PATH TO HIS FIELD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Admon):</span> If Levi went overseas, and the path to his field was lost field (it was annexed to the adjacent field, he does not know where), he receives a short path to his field;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, he must pay whatever his neighbor charges for a path, or else he must fly (i.e. he may not walk) to his field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand Admon (surely, Levi used to have a path, and the neighbor took it). Why do Chachamim argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The case is, he was surrounded by four neighbors on the four sides of his field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is Admon's reason? (He has no Vadai claim against any neighbor!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If every neighbor owned his land (when Levi left), or if all bought from one person who used to own all the property surrounding the field, all agree that they can push off Levi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue when Levi was surrounded by four neighbors, and one person bought all their land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Admon says, in any case the path to his field is by the buyer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, the buyer says, accept my terms. If you protest, I will return the deeds to the original owners (undo the sales), and you will be unable to force them to give you a path.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A dying man said that his daughter should receive a date tree; he died. His sons divided the estate, and did not give to her a tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> This is just like our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> No! In the Mishnah, each neighbor can dispel him and say 'your path is not by me.' Here, the sons divided her tree among themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They must give to her a tree, and make a new division.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>A dying man said that his daughter should receive a date tree. He died, leaving two trees in which he was a half-owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Are two halves of a tree called a tree?</p>
