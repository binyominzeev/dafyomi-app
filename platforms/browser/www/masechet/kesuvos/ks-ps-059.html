<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ENACTMENT TO FEED ONE'S WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> He is feeding her, but is not giving a weekly Ma'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav and Shmuel hold that food was enacted in exchange for (standard) earnings, and a weekly Ma'ah in exchange for extra earnings;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since he is not giving a Ma'ah, the extra earnings are not his.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rav Ada holds that food was enacted in exchange for extra earnings; and a Ma'ah in exchange for earnings;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he is feeding her, the extra earnings are his.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the basis of the argument?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav and Shmuel hold that we enacted what is common (food) in return for what is common (standard earnings). Rav Ada holds that we enacted what is fixed (a Ma'ah) for what is fixed (standard earnings, detailed in the Mishnah 64b).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Ada - Beraisa):</span> Food was enacted in return for earnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means 'in return for <i>extra</i> earnings.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav and Shmuel - Mishnah):</span> If he does not give to her money for extra expenses, she keeps her earnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means 'she keeps her <i>extra</i> earnings.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah proceeds to teach 'How much must she produce? She must spin five Sela'im of warp-thread...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches how much is required, so we will know what is considered extra. The standard is five Sela'im...</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A VOW ABOUT SOMETHING NOT YET IN THE WORLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel contradicts himself! (Above (58b), Shmuel said that the Tana'im argue about Hekdesh of something not yet in the world, and R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar holds that it does not take effect.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a wife vowed 'what my hands produce is Konam (forbidden like a Korban) to your mouth', her husband need not annul it (it is void anyway);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, he should annul it, lest she will earn extra;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yochanan ben Nuri says, he should annul it, lest he divorce her and be unable to remarry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yochanan ben Nuri. (He says the vow takes effect on what is not yet in the world.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Shmuel said that the Halachah follows R. Yochanan ben Nuri regarding extra earnings. (Tosfos - her husband gets them. Rashi - he should annul the vow, like R. Yochanan ben Nuri said, but not due to concern for after divorce, rather, because the vow forbids extra earnings.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, Shmuel should have said that the Halachah follows R. Yochanan ben Nuri regarding extra earnings, or that the Halachah is unlike the first Tana, or that the Halachah follows R. Akiva!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> One cannot ask a question from Konamos to Hekdesh. Konamos are different!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since Reuven can forbid Shimon's property to himself through Konamos, he can also forbid something that is not yet in the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Granted, Reuven can forbid Shimon's friend's property to himself through Konam, just like Reuven can forbid his own property to Shimon (it suffices for the forbidden object <i>or</i> the forbidden person to be in Reuven's Reshus);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But can Reuven forbid something not in the world to Shimon?! (The forbidden object <i>and</i> the forbidden person are not in Reuven's Reshus.) Reuven cannot forbid Shimon's property to Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> The case is, she said 'My hands are Hekdesh to their Maker.' Her hands are in the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Her hands do not become Hekdesh! They are not in her Reshus, for they are obliged to work for the husband!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She said 'they will be Hekdesh after I am divorced.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we ever find that something does not become Hekdesh now, and it becomes Hekdesh later?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ila'i):</span> Yes! Reuven says 'this field that I sell to you should be Hekdesh when I buy it back!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yirmiyah):</span> The comparison is faulty! There, he can be Makdish it now (before selling it). The wife cannot!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> Our case is like Reuven saying 'the field that I <i>sold</i> to you should be Hekdesh when I buy it back.' It does not become Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> The comparison is faulty! There, the buyer owns the field itself and its Peiros. In our case, the wife owns her hands!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">59b----------------------------------------59b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> We find such a case. Reuven says 'the field that I mortgaged to you (gave for collateral for a loan, to eat its produce until the loan is repaid) should be Hekdesh when I redeem it.' The field becomes Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> The comparison is faulty! There, he can redeem the field. The wife cannot divorce herself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> We find such a case. Reuven says 'the field that I mortgaged to you for 10 years should be Hekdesh when I redeem it.' The field becomes Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> The comparison is faulty! There, he can redeem the field after 10 years. A wife can never divorce herself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (to Question (b) - Rav Ashi):</span> One cannot ask from Konamos, for they are different. They are like Hekdesh ha'Guf (for Avodah in the Mikdash), like Rava taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Hekdesh (ha'Guf), the Isur of Chametz, and freeing a slave uproot liens.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, her earnings should become forbidden immediately!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim strengthened the lien of a husband, therefore it does not become Hekdesh now.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WORK A WIFE MUST DO FOR HER HUSBAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A wife must grind, bake, launder, cook, nurse her son, spread her husband's bedsheet, and spin wool;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she brought a slave into the marriage, she is exempted from grinding, baking and laundering;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If she brought two slaves, she is exempted also from cooking and nursing;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If she brought three slaves, she is exempted also from making his bed and spinning wool;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If she brought four slaves, she sits in a comfortable chair (and need not work at all);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Eliezer says, even if she brings 100 slaves, he forces her to spin wool, since idleness causes immorality;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, even if through a vow one forbade his wife to work, he must divorce her and pay a Kesuvah, for idleness leads to insanity.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Does the Mishnah really mean that she grinds? (Water turns the millstone!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, she makes the preparations for grinding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> She grinds using a hand-mill.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Our Mishnah is unlike R. Chiya:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> A wife is only for beauty, and for having and raising children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> A wife is only to receive jewelry to adorn herself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> One who wants to make his wife radiant should clothe her in linen. One who wants to whiten his daughter should feed her chicks and give to her milk to drink before she becomes a Na'arah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She must nurse her son...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike Beis Shamai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> If a wife vowed not to nurse her son, she may not nurse him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel says, her husband can force her to nurse him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he divorces her, he cannot force her. If the baby recognizes his mother, he pays her wages (for nursing) and she must nurse him, due to the danger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Our Mishnah is even like Beis Shamai. The case is, she vowed and he confirmed the vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai holds that he is to blame (for confirming the vow, therefore it can uproot her obligation to him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel hold that she is to blame (so it cannot uproot her obligation).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> If so, they should argue more directly about whether or not he must pay a Kesuvah (when he confirmed a vow that obligates him to divorce her)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> A woman need not nurse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Indeed, our Mishnah is unlike Beis Shamai!</p>
