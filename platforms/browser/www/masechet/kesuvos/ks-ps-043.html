<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT DOES THE FATHER CLAIM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> R. Shimon holds that a person claims a fixed payment rather than a payment that must be assessed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that a person claims something that must be paid in all cases, and not a fine from which the defendant is exempt when he admits.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A DAUGHTER'S EARNINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Avina):</span> Who receives her earnings of a girl who is fed by her brothers (after the father died)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps the brothers are in place of the father. Just like her earnings went to her father, they go to the brothers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps this is different. The father chose to feed her, but a stipulation of her mother's Kesuvah obligates the brothers to feed her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes - Mishnah):</span> A widow is fed from the orphans' estate. They receive her earnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> A widow is different. A man is concerned for the prosperity of his daughter, but not of his widow!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A man is not more concerned for his daughter than for his widow!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> If a man died leaving a widow and a daughter, this is like a daughter and sons when the estate is too small (to feed everyone until the girls mature);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>There, the daughter is fed and the sons beg for food. Also here, the widow is fed and the daughter begs!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A man is more concerned for the disgrace of his widow than his daughter, but he is more concerned for the prosperity of his daughter than of his widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> The sons receive the earnings and Metzi'os of a daughter, even if the father died before collecting them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because she earned or found them in the father's life. After his death, she keeps them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, she is being fed by the brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is when she is not being fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Halachah is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even the opinion that allows one to force his slave to work for him without feeding him says so only about a Kena'ani slave!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding a Yisrael slave it says "with you (he eats like you)." All the more so, one may not receive a daughter's earnings without feeding her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Ula):</span> The Mishnah teaches about her earnings above what the cost of her food (after her father dies, if she is not being fed she keeps them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Surely, a Chacham like Rav Yosef should have anticipated this answer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Rejection of Answer (g) - Rava):</span> Rather, he found a difficulty in the Mishnah itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says that the sons receive her earnings and Metzi'os, even if the father died before collecting them. One does not <i>collect </i>Metzi'os!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, the Mishnah equates her earnings to her Metzi'os. Metzi'os she found in the father's lifetime go to him; what she finds after his death is hers. The same applies to her earnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A daughter who is fed by the brothers keeps her earnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> We learn from "You will bequeath them to your sons" - you bequeath Kena'ani slaves to your sons, but rights to your daughter's revenue do not go to your sons.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> Perhaps the verse discusses only payments for seduction, fines and payments of injuries!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Chanina - Beraisa):</span> The verse discusses payments for seduction, fines and payments of injuries.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> She should receive payments for injuries, since they are due to her pain!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> The case is, someone bruised her face. (The father receives the payment, for it decreases the money people will pay for her.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">43b----------------------------------------43b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira citing Rav):</span> A daughter who is fed by the brothers keeps her earnings - "You will bequeath them to your sons", but not rights to your daughter's revenue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Avimi bar Papa:</span> Shekod (Shmuel) said this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav said this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, also Shekod said this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mar bar Ameimar):</span> Chachamim of Nehardai say that the Halachah follows Rav Sheshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> The Halachah follows Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>The Halachah follows Rav.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN THE FATHER RECEIVES THE <i>KESUVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a girl became Mekudeshes, divorced, Mekudeshes, then widowed (before Bagrus), her father collects her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she had Nisu'in, was divorced, had Nisu'in, and was widowed, she collects her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, he receives the first Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Once she does Nisu'in, he has no jurisdiction over her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The Tana discusses when she was divorced and widowed, but not when she been widowed twice, (for this is severe,) for then she could not remarry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah is like Rebbi, who says that after she is widowed twice (she may not remarry, for) the Chazakah is that her husbands will die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> The first Kesuvah goes to the father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> The father acquired the Kesuvah from the time of Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava - Beraisa):</span> R. Yehudah admits that if she was Mekudeshes, became a Bogeres and had Nisu'in, her father has no jurisdiction over her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not say that the father acquired the Kesuvah from the time of Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Rabah and Rav Yosef taught that he receives it because it was written when she was in his jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FROM WHEN IS THE <i>KESUVAH</i> COLLECTED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From when does she collect? (I.e. if her husband sold property, from when did her lien begin, which allows her to collect from land sold afterwards?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> She collects 100 or 200 (the basic Kesuvah for a non-virgin or virgin) from the time of Kidushin. She collects Tosefes (any addition to this) from the time of Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Asi):</span> She collects the entire amount from the Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Huna contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If a (divorced or widowed) woman is holding two Kesuvos, one for 200 and one (with a later date) for 300, she may collect 200 from the earlier date or 300 from the later date.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Rav Huna's answer above, she should collect 200 from the earlier date and 100 from the later date!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Why doesn't she collect 500, i.e. 200 from the earlier date and 300 from the later date?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that since he did not write 'I am adding 300 to your 200', he intends that she may collect 200 from the earlier date, or 300 from the later date.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Likewise, since he did not write that he is adding 100 to the first 200, she pardoned the lien from the earlier date. (When a man adds Tosefes Kesuvah, he writes 'I added to what Chachamim enacted'; she does not pardon anything.)</p>
