<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE PUNISHMENT OF <i>MOTZI</i> <i>SHEM</i> <i>RA</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> In Beraisa #2 R. Yehudah says that he is Lokeh, i.e. suffers monetarily, only if he had Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would the Tana call paying money 'Lokeh'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one says 'I pledge half my Erech to Hekdesh', he pays half his Erech;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi bar Yehudah says, he is Lokeh and pays his full Erech.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he lashed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> He is stricken by having to pay his full Erech;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is a decree due to one who pledges the Erech of half of himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Since he cannot live without half of himself, he must pay his full Erech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He will be punished" - monetarily; "They will afflict him" - with lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand that the punishment is monetary, like the verse continues "Me'ah Kesef";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>How do we know that 'affliction' is lashes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> We learn "They will afflict" from "They will afflict" (regarding Ben Sorer u'Moreh), which we learn through "Ben-Ben" from "Im Bin Hakos ha'Rasha".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Lav against Motzi Shem Ra?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> "Lo Selech Rachil (do not go around like a talebearer.)"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Nasan):</span> "Guard yourself from every evil matter".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Elazar did not learn like R. Nasan, for he uses that verse like R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir):</span> "Guard yourself from every evil matter" - do not have thoughts (of women) by day, which lead to Tum'ah (nocturnal emissions) at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Nasan did not learn like R. Elazar, for he uses "Lo Selech Rachil" to teach that Beis Din should not be Rach (soft) to one litigant and harsh to the other.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE HUSBAND MUST BRING THE WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If witnesses testified for him without his request, he is not lashed and does not pay. She and the Edim Zomemim are stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot say that she and the witnesses are stoned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> She or the Edim Zomemim are stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he requested the witnesses to testify for him, he would be punished even if he did not hire them. This is unlike R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> He is not liable unless he hired witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> It says "Sam (putting)" regarding Motzi Shem Ra, just like regarding usury;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like there it refers to money, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Questions (R. Yirmiyah):</span> What is the law if he hired them for land, for less than a Perutah, or both witnesses for one Perutah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Questions (Rav Ashi):</span> What is the law if he divorces and remarries her and is Motzi Shem Ra on the first marriage? What is the law if a Yavam is Motzi Shem Ra on his brother's marriage?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer	(to the last question - Beraisa - R. Yonah):</span> "I gave my daughter to this man" - to this man, not to a Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS <i>MOTZI</i> <i>SHEM</i> <i>RA</i> DEPENDENT ON <i>BI'AH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the argument of R. Elazar ben Yakov and Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Motzi Shem Ra is when a man says, I found that your daughter is not a virgin. If witnesses say that she was Mezanah while married to him, her Kesuvah is 100.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If she had adultery, why does she have a Kesuvah? She is stoned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> If witnesses say that she had adultery, she is stoned. If they say that she was Mezanah before Kidushin, her Kesuvah is 100.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If his accusation was false, he is lashed and pays 100 Sela'im, whether or not he had Bi'ah with her;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Elazar ben Yakov says, this (lashes and a fine) is only if he had Bi'ah with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Elazar ben Yakov we understand "<i>U'Va</i> Eleha (this connotes Bi'ah)" and "I drew close to her";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim explain these verses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He came" with accusations; "I drew close" with words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Elazar ben Yakov we understand "I did not find Besulim in your daughter";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>How do Chachamim explain this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "I did not find witnesses who uphold the virginity of your daughter (through Hazamah of the witnesses who say that she was Mezanah)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Elazar ben Yakov we understand "U'Forsu (they will spread) the sheet (on which they had Bi'ah, to check for Dam Besulim)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>How do Chachamim explain this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> "They will clarify (the accusations) he put on her."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tana'im argue about how to explain "U'Forsu" like these two opinions.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "They will spread the sheet" - the witnesses for each side come, and they make the matter as clear as a new sheet;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Elazar ben Yakov says, the verse literally refers to the sheet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Rav Yakov):</span> Even though the Torah never distinguishes between Bi'ah k'Darkah and Lo k'Darkah regarding lashes or punishments, it distinguishes regarding Motzi Shem Ra. He is punished only if he had Bi'ah (even) Lo k'Darkah, and claims that she was Mezanah k'Darkah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yitzchak is not like either Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim obligate even if he didn't have Bi'ah with her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar ben Yakov requires that also he had Bi'ah with her k'Darkah (to be able to claim that there were no Besulim)!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Kahana):</span> He is punished only if he had Bi'ah k'Darkah with her and claims that she was Mezanah k'Darkah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PRIVILEGES A FATHER HAS IN HIS DAUGHTER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A father has the right to be Mekadesh his daughter (and keep the money) through money, a document, or Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He receives her Metzi'os and her earnings;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He can annul her vows;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>He can receive a Get (document of divorce) from her husband (during Eirusin);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>He does <i>not</i> eat the Peiros (produce) of her property in her lifetime;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If she does Nisu'in, her husband has a privilege above what a father has; he eats the Peiros of her property in her lifetime.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Her husband is obligated to feed, redeem and bury her;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yehudah says, even the poorest Yisrael must get two flutists and a woman to arouse the wailing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that he receives the Kidushin money?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "She will leave free; there is no money" - the master (of a Yisraelis slave who goes free when she becomes a Na'arah) does not receive money, but another 'master' receives money, i.e. her father (when she becomes Mekudeshes and leaves him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps she receives the money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The father is Mekadesh her - "I gave my daughter to this man." Surely she does not keep the money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this applies only to a minor, who has no Yad (power of acquisition) to receive Kidushin. A Na'arah has a Yad to receive Kidushin, perhaps she can Mekadesh herself and keep the money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Bi'N'ureha Beis Aviha" teaches that all revenue of a Na'arah goes to her father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Huna learned that her earnings go to her father from "When a man will sell his daughter to be a slave" - just like a slave's earnings go to her master, a girl's earnings go to her father;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why couldn't he learn from "Bi'N'ureha Beis Aviha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that "Bi'N'ureha Beis Aviha" teaches only about vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should say that her father gets her Kidushin money, just like he can annul her vows!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We do not learn monetary laws from non-monetary laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He receives the fine of one who rapes or seduces her. We should learn from this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We do not learn about Mamon from fines.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He receives the payments (of Mamon) for embarrassment and blemish. We should learn from them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Those are different, since they affect him. (They decreased the amount of Kidushin money he can receive for her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> When a slave leaves her master, no money goes to the master she leaves - the implication is that in a similar case (Kidushin), money goes to the master she leaves - her father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> These are not comparable! A slave entirely leaves her master, but an Arusah doesn't leave her father until Nisu'in!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She (partially) leaves his jurisdiction regarding vows;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The father and husband of a Na'arah Me'orasah jointly annul her vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The father can be Mekadesh her via a document or Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"She will be (Mekudeshes) to another man" equates all methods of Kidushin.</p>
