<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE RESULT OF RAV ANAN'S MISTAKE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> It is a Mitzvah to judge either case. It is better to judge this Ploni's case first, since this honors the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When Ploni's opponent saw the honor given to Ploni he was befuddled, and was unable to argue his case well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Eliyahu used to teach Rav Anan. After this episode, he stopped coming. Rav Anan fasted and prayed until Eliyahu returned. He was frightened, and had to sit in a box.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What he learned before this episode is called Seder Eliyahu Rabah. What he learned afterwards is called Seder Eliyahu Zuta.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>There was a famine in the days of Rav Yosef; they asked him to request mercy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> When the Talmidim rose to leave after Elisha's lesson, 2200 remained (i.e. he supported 2200 Talmidim), and he did not request mercy at a time of anger. How can I?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Elisha supported 2200 Talmidim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> What was the question "should I give this before 100 men?"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he refers to giving 22 loaves (for 100 men), at a time of hunger receiving over a fifth of a loaf is a lot!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he asked how each loaf will satisfy 100 men.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rav supported 1200 Talmidim. Rav Huna supported 800 Talmidim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Thirteen men used to broadcast Rav Huna's lessons (because there were so many Talmidim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When the Talmidim rose to leave after the lesson (in Bavel), they shook their cloaks, and the dust blocked out the sun. Even people in Eretz Yisrael could tell when the lesson ended!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Rabah and Rav Yosef supported 400 Talmidim. Abaye (others say that Rav Papa or Rav Ashi) supported 200 Talmidim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They called themselves 'orphans of orphans' (compared to their predecessors).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SOME USES OF TERUMAS HA'LISHKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Radifa):</span> Chachamim who checked Korbanos for blemishes in Yerushalayim received stipends from Terumas ha'Lishkah (money taken from a chamber of half-Shekalim that Yisraelim give every year to buy Korbanos of the Tzibur).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Chachamim who taught to the Kohanim laws of slaughter received stipends from Terumas ha'Lishkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> Chachamim who taught to the Kohanim laws of Kemitzah (taking a handful of a flour-offering) received stipends from Terumas ha'Lishkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Chachamim who checked the accuracy of Sefarim received stipends from Terumas ha'Lishkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Rav):</span> Women who wove Parochos (curtains, for in front of the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim) received stipends from Terumas ha'Lishkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman himself):</span> They received stipends from Bedek ha'Bayis (Hekdesh funds used for upkeep of the Mikdash), since the Parochos (in the second Mikdash) were in place of a wall (in the first Mikdash).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Women that wove Parochos, Beis Garmo (who made the Lechem ha'Panim (showbread), and Beis Avtinas (who made the incense) received stipends from Terumas ha'Lishkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to other curtains, which were not in place of a wall;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> There were 13 Parochos in the second Mikdash. Seven were for the seven gates, one for the opening of the Heichal, one for the opening of the Ulam, two between the Kodesh and the Kodesh ha'Kodashim, and two in the corresponding place in the second story.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Women who raised their children in Taharah to engage in Parah Adumah received stipends from Terumas ha'Lishkah;</p></div>

<div class="bbbline">106b----------------------------------------106b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna):</span> May Klei Shares (Kelim used to serve in the Mikdash) be bought with money of Bedek ha'Bayis?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Are they a need of the outer Mizbe'ach (it is of stone and is like part of the Mikdash), are therefore they are bought from Bedek ha'Bayis funds?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, are they a need of the Korbanos, and therefore they are bought from Terumas ha'Lishkah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> They are bought only from Terumas ha'Lishkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna):</span> "... The rest of the money (given for Bedek ha'Bayis) was used for Kelim".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav):</span> Did you learn only Kesuvim, but not Nevi'im?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> "The money will not be used for bowls..."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (Rav):</span> Bedek ha'Bayis money may not be used for Kelim. If they collected and there was extra money, the excess may be used for Kelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the money may not be used for Kelim (because it is a different Kedushah), this applies even to the excess!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> Beis Din stipulates that if the money will not be needed for Bedek ha'Bayis, (it will not receive Kedushas Bedek ha'Bayis, rather) it will be used for Kelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> We buy Klei Shares with money of Terumas ha'Lishkah - "the remaining money";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which money has a remainder?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> it is Terumas ha'Lishkah (they do not take all the money in the chamber).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say the money left in the chamber is for Klei Shares!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>The</i> remaining money" refers to the first money taken. This is like Rava taught;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "<i>The</i> Olah" refers to the first to be offered (each day, the morning Tamid).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>USES OF HEKDESH MONEY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Incense, and all communal Korbanos come from Terumas ha'Lishkah. The golden Mizbe'ach, frankincense and service Kelim come from Mosar Nesachim (profits from the purchase of flour for offerings. Hekdesh gets a heaping measure and a good price.) The outer Mizbe'ach, the chambers and the courtyards come from Shirei ha'Lishkah (what remains in the chamber after taking Terumas ha'Lishkah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like it was taught, that the city wall, its towers, and all needs of the city come from Shirei ha'Lishkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about which money is used to buy Klei Shares:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mosar Terumah (what is left from Terumas ha'Lishkah after all Korbanos for the year were bought) was used to make a gold plating for the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yishmael says, profits from Peiros (this will be explained) are used for Kitz ha'Mizbe'ach (Olah offerings brought when the Mizbe'ach is idle);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Akiva says, Mosar Terumah is used for Kitz ha'Mizbe'ach. Mosar Nesachim is used for Klei Shares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Chanina the vice-Kohen Gadol says, Mosar Nesachim is for Kitz ha'Mizbe'ach. Mosar Terumah is for Klei Shares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Akiva and R. Chanina did not agree to profits from Peiros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are 'profits from Peiros'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Mosar Terumah was used to buy produce cheaply. The produce was sold when the price went up. The profits were used for Kitz ha'Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'they did not agree to profits from Peiros'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> Mosar Shirei ha'Lishkah was used to buy wine, oil and flour. The profits go to Hekdesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva says, we do not invest Hekdesh or money for the poor in order to reap profits.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We do not invest Hekdesh, because the rich should not appear poor (i.e. like one who seeks every chance to profit).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>We do not invest money for the poor, lest a poor person comes, and there will not be what to give him.</p></div>
