<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>RECOGNIZING THE MOTHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the baby recognizes his mother...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> At what age do we say that a child recognizes his mother?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It is after three months.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Answer #2 (Shmuel) It is after 30 days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is after 50 days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Simi bar Abaye):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand Rav and R. Yochanan. Some babies are faster to recognize their mothers than others;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But Shmuel should agree that a baby cannot recognize his mother after 30 days!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (Rami bar Yechezkel):</span> My brother Rav Yehudah cited Shmuel to say 30 days. This is incorrect. Really, Shmuel said that it depends only on when the baby recognizes her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>A (divorced) woman (who did not want to nurse her baby) came in front of Shmuel. Shmuel told Rav Dimi to see if her son recognizes her. He sat her among other women, and passed her son in front of them. When the baby reached her, he was looking at her. Shmuel told her that she must nurse him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can a blind baby recognize his mother?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He recognizes her smell and (her milk's) taste.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HOW LONG MAY A CHILD NURSE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A child may nurse for 24 months. After this, it is like nursing from a disgusting thing;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, he may nurse for four or five years. If he stopped nursing after 24 months and resumes, it is like nursing from a disgusting thing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps human milk is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Kal v'Chomer supports this! We are lenient about touching animals (a living animal is always Tahor), but we are stringent about their milk (of Tamei species);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We are stringent about touching people (a living Yisrael can become Tamei), all the more so we should be stringent about their milk!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (The Tamei animals are listed in Parshas Shemini, and repeated in Parshas Re'eh.) "The camel (the repetition forbids its milk)... <i>it</i> is Tamei", but milk of humans is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps human milk is permitted because milk of some animals is permitted. The blood of every animal is forbidden, so also human blood should be forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "It" is forbidden, but the blood of humans is permitted. (Rashi - perhaps the same word permits human milk and blood. Alternatively, "Zeh" permits human blood.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> It is not even a Mitzvah (mid'Rabanan) to refrain from human milk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Milk that separated from the breast (into a Kli) is permitted. Nursing (above the permitted age) is despicable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The opposite applies to blood (it is forbidden only if it separated):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If blood is on a loaf, one scrapes it off and eats the loaf;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If blood is between one's teeth, one may swallow it without concern.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> A child may nurse until four or five...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> (He may nurse) even if he can carry a bundle on his shoulder.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is the same Shi'ur (four or five, depending on how healthy he is).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehoshua.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Marinus):</span> A moaning child may suckle (from a goat's udder) on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because suckling is Mefarek (a derivative Melachah of Dash, i.e. extracting a food), done in an unskilled way. (Normally, one milks by hand. Suckling is forbidden only mid'Rabanan, so) Chachamim did not forbid it to one who is in pain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah follows R. Marinus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Nachum Ish Galya):</span> If a gutter pipe became clogged, (on Shabbos and the water is dripping into the house) one may covertly squash the clogging matter with his foot, without concern.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because this is an unskillful way of fixing a Kli. (Normally, it is forbidden mid'Rabanan.) Chachamim did not decree when this will cause a loss.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah follows Nachum Ish Galya.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he ceased nursing after 24 months, he may not resume nursing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long is considered that he stopped?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 Answer (Rav Yehudah bar Chaviva, citing Shmuel):</span> It is three days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 Answer (Rav Yehudah bar Chaviva in front of Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> It is three days.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A NURSING WOMAN MAY NOT MARRY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a woman was widowed during the 24 months of nursing, she may not become Mekudeshes or have Nisu'in until 24 months (lest she become pregnant and wean the baby prematurely);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, she must wait until 18 months.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Nasan bar Yosef says, they argue as Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel do;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai say, the Shi'ur is 24 months. Beis Hillel say, it is 18 months.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, I will explain these opinions:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The opinion that says 24 months (is the Shi'ur for nursing) permits to marry after 21. The opinion that says 18 months permits to marry after 15.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is because milk is not impeded until three months of pregnancy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Ukva):</span> R. Chanina permitted me to marry a nursing woman after the baby was 15 months old.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Abaye's sharecropper asked whether he may Mekadesh a nursing woman when the baby is 15 months old.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> (Yes!) Firstly, the rule is the Halachah follows R. Yehudah when he argues with R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Secondly, the Halachah follows Beis Hillel against Beis Shamai.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Thirdly, Ula ruled like R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Fourthly, R. Chanina permitted this to Mar Ukva.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>These rulings permit Nisu'in. All the more so, Kidushin is allowed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Abaye came before Rav Yosef (his Rebbi).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Rav and Shmuel both require waiting 24 months, excluding the day of birth and the day of Kidushin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Abaye ran three Parsa'os (about 12 kilometers; some say, one Parsah in sand), but did not catch his sharecropper to retract his ruling.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Chachamim say 'Do not rule in the place of your Rebbi, even to permit eating eggs with a dairy dip.' (Aruch - this refers to eggs found inside a slaughtered chicken.) This is not (only) because it shows arrogance. Rather, he will rule incorrectly!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>I had learned this teaching of Rav and Shmuel, and still, I erred!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman gave her baby to a wet-nurse or weaned him, or he died, she may marry immediately.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>A case occurred, and Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua were about to rule like this Beraisa. A woman told them that Rav Nachman had forbidden her to marry in such a case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Nachman permitted widows of the Exilarch's house!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different. A wet-nurse who accepted to nurse a baby of their house would not retract.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papi):</span> We have another source that Rav Nachman forbids!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A woman must wait three months before remarrying even in the following cases (even though it is unlikely or impossible that she is pregnant):</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>She was constantly going to her father's home or was quarrelling with her husband;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Her husband was imprisoned or overseas;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Her husband was too old to have children or sick;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>She was sterile, too old to have children, an Ailonis or a minor;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p>She miscarried after her husband died;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><p>Her womb was uprooted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi permits her to marry immediately.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows decrees of R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (Rav Papa and Rav Huna):</span> We overlooked this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>The Halachah is, if the baby died, she may marry. If she weaned him, she must wait;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> Even if he died, she must wait. If not, perhaps she will kill her baby in order to marry!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Such a case occurred, and a woman choked her baby!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That woman was insane. A normal woman would not kill her baby.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>OBLIGATIONS OF A NURSING WOMAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman accepted to nurse a baby, she may not nurse during this period her own or another's baby;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Even if meager food was stipulated, she must still eat well. She may not eat things bad for the milk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she may not nurse her own baby together with the first, we need not teach that she may not nurse another's baby!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that out of concern for her baby, she would nurse him (if we permitted her) even if enough milk will not remain for the first baby;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, we would permit her to nurse another's baby, for she would not nurse another baby unless more remains for the first;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that if meager food was stipulated, she must still eat well. Who pays for the extra food?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa forbids her to eat things bad for the milk. What are these?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> They are hops, grass, small fish and earth.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> Even Kutach (a dip made with bread and milk) and fried breaded fish are bad.</p></div>
