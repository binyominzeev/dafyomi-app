<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR LAND TORN AWAY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> Reuven sold a field to Shimon, without Acharayos (in case the land is taken from him); Shimon sold it back to Reuven, with Acharayos. Reuven's creditor took the land. Shimon must compensate Reuven.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Granted, Shimon accepted Acharayos for others, but not for when the land is taken due to Reuven!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rava admits in the following case:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Reuven inherited a field from Yakov, and sold it to Shimon, without Acharayos. Shimon sold it back to Reuven, with Acharayos. Yakov's creditor took the field from Reuven.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Shimon must compensate Reuven. The creditor of Yakov is like a regular creditor (i.e. he is not like Reuven's creditor).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> Reuven sold a field to Shimon with Acharayos, and Shimon wrote a document saying that he owes the money. Reuven died, and Reuven's creditor took the field from Shimon. Shimon persuaded him to take the money owed in place of the field.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Reuven's children can say that our father left Metaltelim by you (a monetary debt), and a creditor cannot take Metaltelim of orphans (i.e. the creditor had no claim against us. You did not pay our debt, therefore you still owe to us. Also, since we did not inherit land, you cannot collect compensation (for having lost the field) from us.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Shimon is clever, he will pay the orphans with land, and he can collect compensation from it, like Rav Nachman taught;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If orphans collected land for their father's debt, a creditor can collect from it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A CREDITOR COLLECTS BEINONIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If Reuven sold all his fields to Shimon, Shimon sold one of them to Levi, and Reuven's creditor came to take a field, he may collect from whomever he wants.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is only if Levi bought Beinonis (middle quality land). If he bought high or low quality land, Levi can say 'I toiled to buy land that you cannot collect!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even when he bought Beinonis, the creditor has a choice from whom to collect, only if Levi bought all the Beinonis that Shimon bought from Reuven. If he left some over, he can say 'I left you land by Shimon from which to collect!'</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DOES A CREDITOR'S SEIZRE OF LAND AFFECT THE BORROWER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Abaye):</span> If Reuven sold a field to Shimon with Acharayos, and Reuven's creditor comes to take it, Reuven can claim in Beis Din to try to stop him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The creditor cannot say 'you have no case with me', since Reuven can say 'the one you take it from will demand payment from me.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Abaye):</span> Even if the field was sold without Acharayos, Reuven (can claim in Beis Din to try to stop him, for he) can say 'I do not want Shimon to have complaints against me.'</p></div>
