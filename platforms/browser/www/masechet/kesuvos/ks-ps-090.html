<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If she has a Get, a Kesuvah and witnesses of death:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Get precedes the Kesuvah, she collects two Kesuvos. If the Kesuvah is before the Get, she collects one Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is because a man who remarries his ex-wife does so on condition that she will receive only her original Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A KESUVAH WRITTEN FOR A PRIOR MARRIAGE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Yakov married his son Yosef, a minor, to a woman, and Yosef remained with her in adulthood, he consents that the Kesuvah written when he was a minor should be valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a Nochri converted with his wife, he remains with her on condition that her Kesuvah should be valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> Only 100 or 200 (the basic Kesuvah) is valid, but any addition he had written is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> She is entitled even to the addition.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If he made a new addition to her Kesuvah, she receives the addition.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he did not add now, she would not receive any (even a previous) addition!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, she receives also the new addition.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Seifa):</span> If he added to her Kesuvah, she receives the addition. If he did not add, she receives only 100 or 200.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Rav Yehudah is refuted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The Mishnah caused Rav Yehudah to err. He understood 'Her Kesuvah is valid' to mean the entire Kesuvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Really, it refers only to the basic Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK MI SHE'HAYAH</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH WIFE COLLECTS HER KESUVAH FIRST?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man had two wives and he died, his first wife collects before the second, and her heirs collect before the heirs of the second;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he married a woman and she died, then he married a second woman and he died, the second woman or her heirs collect before the heirs of the first wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Version #1:</span> The Mishnah says that the first wife collects before the second. It does not say that the first collects and the second does not. This implies that if the second wife seized property, she keeps it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If a man owed money to two creditors and the latter collected his debt before the former, the collection stands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the collection does not stand;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah says that the first collects before the second, even b'Di'eved!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is like the Mishnah that says that a son inherits before a daughter (and clearly, even if she seized property it reverts to the son).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> The Mishnah does not say that if the second wife seized property, she keeps it. This implies that if she seized property, she does not keep it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If a man owed money to two creditors and the latter collected his debt before the former, the collection is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the collection stands;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Seifa says that the second wife or her heirs come before the heirs of the first wife. (There we could not teach that if the first heirs collected, b'Di'eved they keep it, for this is not true.) For parallel structure, the Reisha said that the first wife comes before the second (even though if the latter collected, b'Di'eved she keeps it).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he married the first...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>We learn three things from the Mishnah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kesuvas Benin Dichrin (the enactment that sons inherits their mother's Kesuvah) applies even when the husband dies in the middle (one wife dies before him and the other after him), and we are not concerned for quarrels. (The latter woman's sons might say 'we inherited our mother's Kesuvah <i>from her</i>. You should not inherit <i>from our father</i> (who inherited your mother's Kesuvah) more than us!')</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We learn this from the wording of the Mishnah. It says that the second wife and her heirs come before the heirs of the first wife. This implies that if there is enough property, the heirs of the first wife also receive.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We learn that collection of a Kesuvah from the estate is considered like having an extra Dinar above the Kesuvos, and the enactment applies (whenever the husband dies in the middle. Kesuvas Benin Dichrin does not apply when it would totally uproot inheritance (52b), but here it is as if the heirs inherited and the latter Kesuvah was collected from them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We learn this from the fact that the Mishnah does not say that there must be an extra Dinar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We learn that Kesuvas Benin Dichrin is not collected from sold land.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it would be, the heirs of the first wife would collect from the heirs of the second.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah does not prove the first law!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps Kesuvas Benin Dichrin does not apply when the husband dies in the middle. Rather, the Mishnah teaches that the heirs of the second wife inherit before heirs of the first wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the first wife's sons do not inherit through her, why are they called <i>her</i> heirs?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are called her heirs for parallel structure with the Seifa (which discusses heirs of the second wife who inherit her Kesuvah from her).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah does not prove the second law!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps a Kesuvah is not like an extra Dinar. The case is, there is an extra Dinar in the estate!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHEN THE HUSBAND DIED IN THE MIDDLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not Kesuvas Benin Dichrin applies when the husband dies in the middle.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Ben Nanas):</span> If the husband died in the middle, sons of the first wife to die can tell sons of the second 'you are children of a creditor. Take your mother's Kesuvah, and leave (we receive the rest through Kesuvas Benin Dichrin)';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva says, the inheritance has already jumped from the first wife's sons to the second wife's sons.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Ben Nanas holds that Kesuvas Benin Dichrin applies when he died in the middle. R. Akiva holds that it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rabanan):</span> No, all agree that it applies. They argue about whether or not a Kesuvah is considered like an extra Dinar. The argument also applies if payment of a debt from the estate is considered like an extra Dinar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Ben Nanas says that payment of a Kesuvah or debt is considered like an extra Dinar. R. Akiva says that it is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rabah):</span> No, all agree that payment of a debt from the estate is considered like an extra Dinar. They only argue about whether or not a Kesuvah is considered like an extra Dinar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> If so, why does R. Akiva say that the inheritance has already jumped from the first wife's sons to the second wife's sons? He should say that this applies only if there is an extra Dinar!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> They argue about whether or not Kesuvas Benin Dichrin applies when he died in the middle, like originally suggested.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The following Tana'im also argue about this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he married a woman and she died, he married a second woman and he died, this (second) woman's sons collect her Kesuvah after her death;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, if there is an extra Dinar, these collect their mother's Kesuvah and these collect their mother's Kesuvah. If not, they divide the estate equally.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Shimon holds that Kesuvas Benin Dichrin applies when the husband dies in the middle; the first Tana says that it does not.</p></div>
