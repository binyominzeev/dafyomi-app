<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>FOR WHICH WOMEN IS THERE A FINE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>This answer is valid if R. Yesheivav merely came to disagree with R. Simai (he did not really mean <i>every</i> forbidden Bi'ah. He only wanted to include a widow to a Kohen Gadol.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If R. Yesheivav said an independent statement, even Chayavei Aseh produce Mamzerim, and Ein Kidushin Tofsin. What do Shimon ha'Teimani and R. Shimon ben Menasya argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about a Kohen Gadol who married a non-virgin (Kidushin is Tofsin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than other Chayavei Aseh?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This Isur does not apply to everyone.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CAPITAL OFFENSES EXEMPT FROM PAYMENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> All (i.e. both Tana'im of the Beraisa) agree that a man who raped a Nidah pays a fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kidushin is Tofsin with her. He may marry her (and have Bi'ah with her after she becomes Tehorah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He (Rashi - the Tana of our Mishnah) teaches unlike R. Nechunya ben Hakanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nechunya ben Hakanah):</span> Yom Kipur is like Shabbos regarding paying (for obligations incurred while doing a Melachah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>On Shabbos, since he is liable to death for the Melachah, he is exempt from payment. The same applies to Yom Kipur (Kares includes Misah b'Yedei Shamayim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he learn this way?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It says "Ason (fatality)" regarding acts of man (fighting) and regarding acts of Shamayim (Yakov's concern for Binyamin).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like liability to die through man (Beis Din) exempts (from paying for obligations incurred at the time he transgressed), liability to die b'Yedei Shamayim exempts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> Why do you assume that Yakov was concerned for colds and heatstroke, i.e. acts of Shamayim? Perhaps it refers to thieves and lions, acts of man!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yakov was certainly concerned for both!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Colds and heatstroke are not in the hands of Heaven!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All is in the hands of Heaven, except for colds and heatstroke.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Lions and thieves are not in the hands of man!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Even though the Sanhedrin ceased after Churban Beis ha'Mikdash, the four death penalties did not cease.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They did cease!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The penalties are still meted out;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Someone liable to be stoned (the first step is to through him to the ground) falls off a roof or is trampled by an animal;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Someone liable to be burned falls into a fire or is bitten by a snake;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Someone liable to death by the sword is killed by the government or bandits;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>Someone liable to be strangled dies of croup or drowns.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, lions and thieves are b'Yedei Shamayim. Colds and heatstroke are due to man.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question (c) - Rava):</span> R. Nechunya ben Hakanah learns from "If people will ignore (and not execute)... one who gives his seed to Molech... I will give him Kares";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This equates Kares from Shamayim to our death penalties. Just like our death penalties exempt from payment, also Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Rava and Abaye argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about a Zar who eats Terumah (it is punishable by death b'Yedei Shamayim, but not Kares).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Abaye exempts (from payment), and Rava obligates.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Abaye really exempt?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> R. Nechunya ben Hakanah agrees that if Reuven eats Shimon's Chelev, he must pay!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>When Reuven picked it up, he became a thief and was obligated to return it. The exemption due to the Chiyuv Kares does not apply until he eats it.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Also here, he is liable (to return or pay) for the Terumah once he picks it up. He is not Chayav Misah b'Yedei Shamayim until he eats it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, someone else put the Terumah in Reuven's mouth (Reuven never picked it up).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Still, he is liable for it once he chews it, but is not Chayav Misah until he swallows it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was stuck down his throat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How far down was it stuck?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he could have spit it out, he should have (he must pay for not doing so)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he could not spit it out, why is he liable to die (he had no choice)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He could have spit it out with great difficulty.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (m) - Rav Papa):</span> Someone else put Terumah liquids in Reuven's mouth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, a Zar ate his own Terumah and tore someone else's silk at the same time.</p></div>
