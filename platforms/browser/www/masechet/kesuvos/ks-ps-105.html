<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>JUDGES WHO MADE DECREES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There were two judges in Yerushalayim who made decrees, Admon and Chanan ben Avishalom. Chanan said two laws. Admon said seven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a man went overseas and his wife demands food, Chanan says that she swears when she collects the Kesuvah in the end, not at the beginning;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The sons of Kohanim Gedolim said that she swears at the beginning and the end;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Dosa ben Harkinas agrees with the sons of Kohanim Gedolim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yochanan ben Zakai says, Chanan is correct. She swears only at the end.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Contradiction:</span> There were three judges of burglaries in Yerushalayim: Admon ben Gedai, Chanan ha'Mitzri, and Chanan ben Avishalom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is a contradiction about the number of judges, and also about whether they made decrees or judged burglaries.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Resolution - part 1 (regarding the numbers):</span> The Tana of the Mishnah listed only the most important judges (Rashi; Tosfos - the judges who taught laws in our Perek).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Resolution - part 2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> They made decrees about burglaries;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> For cutting down a sapling, the judges who made decrees in Yerushalayim ruled that one pays two silver coins for a first year sapling, and four silver coins for a second year sapling. (Rashi explains that the Beraisa discusses an animal that cut down a tree, because 'Kitmah' is feminine. Our Gemara calls this burglary, for it knows that the same fine applies to a person who cut down a tree. Chachamim do not decree solely for unusual cases.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #1):</span> There were three judges in Yerushalayim who made decrees: Admon, Chanan, and Nachum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The Tana of Beraisa #1 is R. Nasan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> Also Nachum ha'Midi made decrees in Yerushalayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim did not agree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There were more judges!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Pinchas):</span> There were 394 Batei Din in Yerushalayim, and the same number of Batei Kenesiyos, Batei Medrash, and schools for children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There were many other judges. Only these made decrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The judges who made decrees in Yerushalayim received stipends from the coins brought to buy Korbanos, 9900 Zuz in all. If they were unhappy with this, they received more.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Do we discuss wicked judges (who take more money than they need)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if this was not enough they received more, even if they didn't want more.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MAY JUDGES RECEIVE MONEY FOR JUDGING?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Karna used to receive a Selah from both parties when he judged a case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says, "Don't take a bribe"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that is only when a judge takes only from one party, lest it bias his judgment. Karna took from both parties, so he would be unbiased.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even a bribe to give an unbiased judgment is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Do not take a bribe" does not discuss one who intends to acquit the guilty and convict the innocent. It already says "Do not pervert judgment"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rather, bribes are forbidden even with intent to acquit the innocent and convict the guilty!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Karna did not take the money as a bribe, rather for wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even for wages, it is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one receives wages for judging, his judgments are void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to one who takes wages for the ruling itself. Karna took compensation for what he could have earned in the time he judged.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is such compensation really permitted?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A judge who takes wages to judge is repulsive, but his ruling is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the wages are for the ruling, the ruling is void!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he takes compensation for what he could have earned. The Beraisa calls this repulsive!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is repulsive when it is unclear what he could have earned in the time. People used to pay Karna a Zuz to smell wine and evaluate it (how long it will be before it spoils), so it was clear what he could have earned in the time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When people would come to Rav Huna for judgment, he would ask them to get someone to draw water in his stead.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE HAZARD OF BRIBES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> See how much bribes blind the eyes of those who take them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A person whose eyes hurt him pays a doctor, even though he is unsure whether or not he will cure them. One who takes a bribe of a Perutah blinds his own eyes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Bribery blinds the eyes of Chachamim", all the more so, of fools. "And it perverts the words of Tzadikim", all the more so, of the wicked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Fools and the wicked may not be judges!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, "bribery blinds the eyes of Chachamim", even a great Chacham. If he takes a bribe, his heart will be blinded before he dies;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">105b----------------------------------------105b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"And it perverts the words of Tzadikim", even a total Tzadik. If he takes a bribe, he will become foolish before he dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> "A king will establish the land in judgment; a man of Terumos will ravage it" - if a judge is like a king, who does not need anyone, he will establish the land. If he is like a Kohen who runs to granaries to collect Terumah, he will demolish it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Shila):</span> A judge who often borrows things may not judge.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if he has nothing to lend in return. If he has, there is no problem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rava often borrowed from Rebbi bar Meryon, and didn't lend to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava only borrowed from him to elevate Rebbi bar Meryon's reputation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Torah forbids bribery, because one who receives a bribe feels close to the giver, like to himself, and a person does not see that he himself is guilty.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Shochad" (bribe) is like 'Shehu Chad (he is like one with the giver).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> One may not judge someone he loves or someone he hates;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he loves Ploni, he will not see that Ploni is guilty;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he hates Ploni, he will not see that Ploni is innocent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If a Chacham sees that people of his city love him, this does not show that he is praiseworthy. Rather, he does not rebuke them in spiritual matters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> I used to think that everyone in my city loved me. When I became a judge, I thought that the ones I convicted hate me, and the ones I acquitted love me.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When I saw that the same people I convict today, I acquit tomorrow, I concluded that either they all love me, or all hate me.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Do not take a bribe." Clearly, one cannot take money! The verse forbids even non-monetary bribes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Shmuel was walking on a bridge, and a man lent to him a hand. The man had a case; Shmuel disqualified himself from judging him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>A feather blew onto Ameimar's head, and a man removed it. Ameimar disqualified himself from judging his case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Mar Ukva spit, and a man covered the spit. Mar Ukva disqualified himself from judging his case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi's sharecropper used to bring to him a basket of produce from R. Yishmael's orchard every Erev Shabbos. Once he brought it on Thursday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Why did you bring it early?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The sharecropper:</span> I had to come for judgment anyway.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yishmael refused to take the produce and disqualified himself from judging him. R. Yishmael got other judges to judge him. He heard the case, and kept thinking how his sharecropper should claim in order to win.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Cursed are those who take bribes! I did not take, and had I took, it would have been my own, and still, I was biased. Those who take bribes, how much the more so!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>A man who came for judgment brought the first shearings of his flock (which must be given to a Kohen) to R. Yishmael bar Elisha. When R. Yishmael heard that the man was from far away and could have given them to other Kohanim, he refused to take them and disqualified himself from judging him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael got other judges to judge him; he heard the case, and kept thinking how this man should claim in order to win.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Cursed are those who take bribes! I did not take, and had I took, it would have been my own, and still, I was biased. Those who take bribes, how much the more so!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>Ploni came for judgment and brought fish to Rav Anan. Rav Anan refused to take them and disqualified himself from judging him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ploni:</span> You need not judge me, but take the fish, or else you will stop me from bringing Bikurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "A man brought... Bikurim (to Elisha)" - did Elisha eat Bikurim?! (He was not a Kohen. He was from Shevet Gad!)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, if one gives a gift to a Chacham, it is as if he brought Bikurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Anan:</span> I was not going to accept the fish. Now, I will accept them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Anan sent Ploni to Rav Nachman. He enclosed a note saying that he himself could not judge him. Rav Nachman assumed that this was because they were relatives. Rav Nachman also had a case of orphans to judge.</p>
