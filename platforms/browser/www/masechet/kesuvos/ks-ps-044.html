<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TWO DOCUMENTS FOR THE SAME TRANSACTION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> She may collect whichever Kesuvah she wants.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He argues with Rav Nachman.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If there are two documents (of sale or gift for the same property to the same recipient) with different dates, the latter invalidates the former.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They need not argue!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Rav Nachman admits that if the second document adds on a date tree, it was written for the addition and does not invalidate the first document.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Also in Rav Huna's case, the second Kesuvah adds to the first!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Clearly, if the first document was a sale and the second is a gift, the second does not invalidate the first. It was written to protect the buyer from the law of Bar Metzra. (When land is sold, the neighbors have first rights to buy it. This does not apply to gifts.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>All the more so, if the first was a gift, and the second was a sale, it does not invalidate the first. The second was written to guarantee the receiver compensation if the property will be taken by creditors.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>When both are sale documents or both are gifts, the latter invalidates the former.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rafram):</span> The recipient requested another document because he agrees that the first one is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha):</span> The recipient pardoned the earlier lien.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>There are three practical differences between these reasons:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to Answer #1, the recipient invalidates the witnesses (or signatures) on his first document (he cannot rely on them for other documents);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to Answer #1, the recipient must pay for produce he ate from the land between the dates on the two documents;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>According to Answer #1, the seller must pay the property taxes for the period between the documents.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we rule (about question 4:a, Daf 43B)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Eliezer bar R. Shimon says that 100 or 200 is collected from the Kidushin. Tosefes is collected from the Nisu'in;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim say that all is collected from the Nisu'in.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TO WHICH CONVERTS DO THE LAWS OF MOTZI SHEM RA APPLY?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman converted with her daughter and the daughter was Mezanah (while she was a Na'arah Me'orasah), she is strangled. She is not killed at her father's doorway, and there is no fine of 100 Shekalim if her husband is (falsely) Motzi Shem Ra against her;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If her mother converted between conception and birth, she is stoned (for such Znus), but not at her father's doorway, and there is no fine of 100;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If her mother converted before conception, she is like a Bas Yisrael in all respects.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Even if a girl has a father but her father has no doorway, or his house has a doorway but she has no father, her punishment is stoning;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mitzvah is to stone her at the father's door. If this cannot be done, she is still stoned.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">44b----------------------------------------44b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Reish Lakish):</span> "And she will die" teaches that she is stoned even if her mother converted between conception and birth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, one who is Motzi Shem Ra on her should be lashed and pay!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "And she will die" applies to execution, not to a fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is only if the conversion was before conception!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Such a girl is a regular Bas Yisrael. The verse is not needed in such a case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the verse includes even if the conversion was after birth!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "B'Yisrael" excludes this.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MOTZI SHEM RA ON AN ORPHAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> One who is Motzi Shem Ra on an orphan is exempt. "He will give to the father of the Na'arah" excludes an orphan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi bar Avin - Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> The repetition "Im Ma'en Yima'en" teaches that also an orphan receives a fine!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Avin):</span> That is when she was orphaned between the seduction and the trial.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who is Motzi Shem Ra on an orphan is punished:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ami - Beraisa):</span> "A virgin of Yisrael" excludes a virgin convert.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand this if Motzi Shem Ra on an orphan is normally punished. The verse exempts Motzi Shem Ra on a convert.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>But if one is always exempt for an orphan, why must a verse exempt for a convert? (According to Halachah, she has no father!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Motzi Shem Ra on a minor is exempt - "He will give to the father of the Na'arah." Na'arah is written full (with a Hei), to teach that we discuss a full (adult) Na'arah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha bar Aba):</span> Even without the Hei, we would know that a minor is not included!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"The Na'arah... will be stoned" - we do not punish a minor!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, here the Torah discusses a full Na'arah. When Na'arah is written without a Hei, it includes even a minor.</p></div>
