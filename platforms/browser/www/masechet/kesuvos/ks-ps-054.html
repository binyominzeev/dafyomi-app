<p class="dedicationbox">KESUVOS 54 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH DAUGHTERS ARE FED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> Is the daughter of a Sheniyah (a relative forbidden mid'Rabanan) fed (after the husband dies)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since a Sheniyah has no Kesuvah (she has no provisions of the Kesuvah), her daughter is not fed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps Chachamim fined only the mother, who sinned, but not her daughter!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Is the daughter of his Arusah fed (after he dies)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since an Arusah has a Kesuvah, her daughter is fed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since she has no Kesuvah until Nisu'in, her daughter is not fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If a man raped Dinah (and married her), is her daughter fed after he dies?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Yosi bar Yehudah, clearly she is fed. He says that Dinah has a Kesuvah of 100;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The question is according to Chachamim, who say that the fine is in place of her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since she has no Kesuvah, the daughter is not fed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, we say that she lacks only Ikar Kesuvah, which is so it will not be light in her husband's eyes to divorce her. This does not apply to a rapist, who cannot divorce her (but all other provisions of the Kesuvah do apply).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE WIDOW LIVES IN HIS HOUSE AND IS FED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> 'You will sit in my house...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> In my house - not in my shack (if the husband did not leave a proper house, just a shack, she has no privilege to stay in it); she is fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> In such a case, she is not even fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah does not follow Mar bar Rav Ashi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> If they asked to marry her and she agreed she is not fed (she is no longer in 'the days of widowhood').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she did not agree, is she fed (in any case)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Anan citing Shmuel):</span> If she refused due to her deceased husband, she is fed. If she refused because the suitor was not fitting, she is not fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If she had Znus, she is not fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If she colored her eyes and beautified herself, she is not fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Chisda, who says that she is not fed if she had Znus, certainly agrees that she is not fed if she colored her eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Yosef, who said that she is not fed if she colored her eyes, would say that she is fed if she had Znus.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is because her evil inclination forced her. (She does not seek to remarry.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Halachah does not follow any of these teachings (Tosfos - except for Shmuel's). Rather, it is like Rav Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If she demanded to be paid her Kesuvah in Beis Din, she is not fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If she sold her Kesuvah, used it for collateral or designated that it will be used to pay a loan, she is not fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>For these, she forfeits being fed, but not for demanding payment!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For these, whether or not she did them in Beis Din she forfeits being fed. She forfeits food for demanding payment only in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> People in Yerushalayim and Galil wrote this...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Halachah follows the people of Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows the people of Galil.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bavel and its nearby cities conduct like Rav. Nehardai and its nearby cities conduct like Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>A woman from Mechuza married a man from Nehardai. She came to Rav Nachman, who could tell from her voice that she was from Mechuza (which is near Bavel). He judged her case like Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> But she married a man from Nehardai!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> If so, we judge her case like Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How far does Nehardai extend (for this law)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is as far as the Kav (a measure) of Nehardai is used.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS A WIDOW'S CLOTHING COUNTED TOWARDS THE <i>KESUVAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We evaluate the clothing a widow is wearing (it is considered partial payment of her Kesuvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is not deducted from her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> They hold oppositely regarding a worker who lives by his employer (whether or not clothing he is wearing (that his employer bought for him) is deducted from his wages.).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> They argue similarly regarding a hired worker;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav gave a Siman to remember his opinion - a widow and a worker, strip them and send them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Even though a Mishnah supports Shmuel, the Halachah follows Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one made his property Hekdesh, or pledged his Erech value to Hekdesh, the Gizbar (treasurer of Hekdesh) does not collect from his wife's or children's clothing, nor from clothing he dyed for them, nor from new sandals he bought for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Since the Mishnah supports Shmuel, why is the law as Rav?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The Mishnah appears to support Shmuel. When you look deeper, you find that it does not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Gizbar not collect from her clothing, because the husband gave it to her to wear in front of him (i.e. during the marriage);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He did not give it to her to leave with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The daughter-in-law of Bar Elyashiv's house wanted to be paid her Kesuvah. She was taking the orphans to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Orphans:</span> It is a disgrace to us for you to appear like this in Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She put on all her ornaments and came to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> The Halachah follows Rav. We evaluate what she is wearing.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHO PROFITS FROM A CHANGE IN PRICE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A dying man said that his daughter should receive a dowry of (standard) garments. The price went down.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> The orphans profit. (We do not give to her the amount they would have cost when he commanded to give them.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">54b----------------------------------------54b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A man said that 400 Zuz from his wine should go to his daughter. The price of wine increased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The profit goes to the orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yochanan's relatives were concerned that their father's wife was spending too much on food. He counseled them to ask their father to designate some land towards her food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>After the father died, they came in front of Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> The father gave this land so she should have extra food from it (if you will give to her minimal rations)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Orphans:</span> R. Yochanan did not say so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> Give to her, or I will withdraw R. Yochanan's support from you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>They came to R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> I cannot overrule Reish Lakish. He is qualified to disagree with me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu citing R. Yochanan):</span> If he said '<i>towards</i> her food', he gave extra. If he said; '<i>for</i> her food', he set a limit.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>ADDING ON TO THE STANDARD <i>KESUVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even though Chachamim said that the Kesuvah of a virgin is 200 and of a non-virgin is 100, one may add even 10,000 if he wants. If she is widowed or divorced, whether from Eirusin or Nisu'in, she collects it all;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Elazar ben Azaryah says, from Nisu'in she collects it all. From Eirusin, she collects 100 or 200.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He wrote the Tosefes (addition) only on condition that they have Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, he may write 200 to a virgin, and she writes (a receipt) that she received 100 (even if she did not). He may write 100 to a non-virgin, and she writes that she received 50;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir says, if one reduced the Kesuvah from 200 for a virgin or from 100 for a non-virgin, their Bi'ah is like Znus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Obviously a man may add! Why should it be forbidden?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would have thought that Chachamim did not want him to do so, lest this shame one who cannot give so much.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Mishnah did not say that one who wants to <i>write</i>, rather, one who wants to <i>add</i>. (This connotes that the addition is considered part of the Kesuvah. It is not a mere gift.) This supports R. Eibo:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Eibo):</span> (Tosefes and other) stipulations of the Kesuvah are like the Kesuvah. This is relevant to a woman who:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Sells or pardons her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rebels (refuses to have Bi'ah with her husband);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Says that she received only partial payment of the Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>Demands payment of her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>Transgresses Das (causes her husband to transgress Torah law, or does not behave like modest Bnos Yisrael).</p>
