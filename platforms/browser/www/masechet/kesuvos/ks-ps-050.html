<p class="dedicationbox">KESUVOS 50 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TZEDAKAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila'a):</span> In Usha it was enacted that one should not give more than a fifth of his income to Tzedakah, lest he come to need to take from people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One should not give more than a fifth of his income to Tzedakah, lest he come to need to take from people;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> A case occurred in which a man wanted to give more. His colleague, R. Yesheivav, did not allow him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> R. Yesheivav wanted to give more. His colleague, R. Akiva, did not allow him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> We learn from "Aser A'asrenu (I will tithe twice)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The second tithe (is a tenth of the 90% remaining after the first tithe) is less than a tenth. In all, less than a fifth is given!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> "A'asre<i>nu</i>" - I will take the second tithe (on it, i.e. all that You give to me,) like the first tithe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> These three teachings of R. Ila'a are in descending order (of the number of Amora'im he quoted).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Siman (way) to remember the order of the teachings is 'children wrote and squandered'.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN TO TEACH CHILDREN <i>TORAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> In Usha it was enacted that a man should be gentle with a son that does not want to learn until age 12. From then on, he should whip him and deprive him of food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav said 'Do not accept to teach a child below six. After six, stuff him (with Torah) like an ox!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> One stuffs him with Torah, but does not whip or hunger him until 12.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Six is the age to afflict a son who refuses to learn Chumash. Twelve is the age for one who refuses to learn Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye, citing his (surrogate) mother):</span> Six is the age to learn Chumash, 10 is the age to learn Mishnah, 13 is the age to fast (on Yom Kipur) the entire day, and for a girl, 12.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye, citing his mother):</span> If a boy is bitten by a scorpion on the day he turns six, he will die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the cure?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Take bile of a white Dayah bird and anoint him with it, and give him some to drink with beer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye, citing his mother):</span> If a boy is stung by a bee on the day he turns one, he will die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the cure?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Put moss of a date tree in water; anoint him with it, and give him some to drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Katina):</span> If one starts teaching his child before six, he will run but not succeed (to cure him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> His peers will run but not succeed (to attain his level of learning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #1:</span> Both are true. He will be weak and learned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> If a sickly child starts learning before 6, he will never be cured. If he is healthy, he will learn greatly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> In Usha they enacted that if a woman sold her Nichsei Melug (property that she brought into the marriage), when she dies her husband takes the property from the buyers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Yosi bar Yitzchak heard from R. Avahu that R. Yosi bar Chanina taught this. R. Yosi learned this from him 40 times, until it was utterly ingrained in him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Happy is the one who guards justice and constantly does Tzedakah" - is it possible to constantly do Tzedakah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Our teachers in Yavneh):</span> This refers to one who feeds his children when they are minors.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> This refers to one who raises orphans in his home and marries them off.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna or Rav Chisda):</span> "Wealth in his house; his Tzedakah stands forever" refers to one who learns and teaches Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Huna and Rav Chisda):</span> This refers to one who writes Sefarim (Tanach) and lends them to others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> "And you will see children to your sons; Shalom upon Yisrael." If all sons have children, there is no need for Yibum or Chalitzah (which leads to strife).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> When there are children there is no dispute about who inherits. There will be Shalom among the judges of Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FEEDING THE DAUGHTERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Elazar ben Azaryah expounded...</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">50b----------------------------------------50b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> Just like sons inherit only land, also daughters are fed only from land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (everyone):</span> If one died without land, don't his sons inherit (Metaltelim)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rav Yosef):</span> Perhaps Rav Hamnuna refers to Kesuvas Benin Dichrin (an enactment that sons inherit their mother's dowry - 52b).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Hamnuna:</span> You are a great Chacham, therefore you understood what I meant.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Yosef):</span> Rav was <i>Zan</i> from wheat of <i>Aliyah</i> (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Possibility #1:</span> 'Zan' refers to Parnasah (dowry). 'Aliyah' refers to the estimation of how much the father would have given, like Shmuel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We estimate the father's generosity to determine how much of a dowry to give to his daughters (from his estate after he died).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Possibility #2:</span> 'Zan' literally means fed. 'Aliyah' refers to nice teachings said in the attic:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> In the attic, they enacted that daughters be fed (also) from Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A case occurred in which Shmuel ruled to be Zan orphan girls be fed from Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He literally fed them, like R. Yitzchak bar Yosef's teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it was Parnasah, like he holds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We estimate the generosity of the father to determine how much of a dowry to give his daughters. (Therefore, we give even from Metaltelim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>A case occurred in Nehardai; Rav Chana bar Bizni fed the girls from Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Return them, or I will confiscate your houses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rav Ami and Rav Asi planned to feed from Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yakov bar Idi:</span> Will you do something that R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish did not do?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Elazar planned to feed from Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Elyakim:</span> Surely you know that this is not the law. You merely want to be merciful. Refrain, lest Talmidim see and establish this to be the Halachah forever!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Rav Yosef ruled that daughters be fed from dates on mattresses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> A creditor would not collect from them (they are Metaltelim of heirs)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> I referred to dates ready to be put on mattresses (they are ready to be harvested).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is ready to be harvested is considered to be harvested (i.e. Metaltelim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> I referred to dates that must remain on the tree a little longer.</p>
