<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A FINE AFTER DEATH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> She cannot become pregnant (and give birth before becoming a Bogeres)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi - Beraisa):</span> Three women use a wad to prevent pregnancy: a minor, a pregnant woman, and a nursing woman. (Rashi - they <i>may</i> use a contraceptive wad at the time of Bi'ah. Tosfos - this is forbidden! Rather, they <i>must</i> use a wad <i>after</i> Bi'ah to remove the semen.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A minor does so, lest she get pregnant and die;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>A pregnant woman does so lest the fetus get mashed (Rashi - if a second fetus is conceived; Tosfos - this is impossible. Rather, we are concerned lest there are already two fetuses inside, and semen will enter between them);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>A nursing woman does so lest pregnancy force her to wean her baby, and it will die.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir says, a girl between 11 and 12 years uses a tuft. If she is younger or older, she has Bi'ah normally.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim say, at any age she has normal Bi'ah. Shamayim will have mercy on her - "Hash-m guards the simple."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps she became pregnant and gave birth while she was a Na'arah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> She cannot give birth in six months!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Only six months separate a Na'arah from a Bogeres.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the interim is never less than six, but sometimes it is more.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shmuel said 'only'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, Rava asked about a girl who died without children.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If she becomes a Bogeres after death, the father loses the fine;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If she doesn't become a Bogeres, her father receives the fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> Is death considered like becoming a Bogeres (i.e. does it make her leave her father's jurisdiction)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If he raped or seduced her and then she became Mekudeshes, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It does not say 'the father of the Na'arah who (even now) is not Mekudeshes'! (Certainly, the father still collects the fine.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If he had Bi'ah with her and then she had Nisu'in, she receives the fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this? It does not say 'the father of the Na'arah who is not Nesu'ah'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is no comparison. Nisu'in removes her from her father's jurisdiction, just like becoming a Bogeres;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If she was raped or seduced and then became a Bogeres, she receives the fine. The same applies to if she had Nisu'in;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Kidushin does not take her from the jurisdiction of the father!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The father and husband of a Na'arah Me'orasah (Arusah) jointly annul her vows.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A RAPIST AND A SEDUCER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A seducer pays three payments: embarrassment, blemish and a fine.	A rapist pays these and also for pain;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A rapist pays a fine immediately. A seducer pays when he divorces her;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A rapist must keep her for a wife. A seducer may divorce her;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>When is a rapist forced to marry her? This is even if she is lame, blind or leprous;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If he found immorality in her, or if she may not marry a Yisrael, he may not stay married to her. "She will be his wife" - she must be fitting for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> For which pain does he pay?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel's father):</span> He threw her to the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> According to this, if he threw her onto silk he is exempt?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is true!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rejection (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Yehudah) A rapist does not pay for pain, because she was destined to suffer the pain in any case, when she marries. (Her husband will not throw her on the ground! Rather, he refers to pain of the first Bi'ah.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The pain of one who is forced is greater than that of one who willingly has Bi'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> He pained her by opening her legs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, a seducer should also pay!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> (She consented.) This is like one who says 'tear my silk and be exempt.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why is this like 'tear <i>my</i> silk'? The payment belongs to her father!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> Rather, wise women say that a seduced woman suffers no pain.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that they (women who willingly have first Bi'ah with their husbands) do!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> My (surrogate) mother told me that it is a trifling pain, like hot water on a bald head.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> My wife told me that it is like a bloodletter's incision.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> My wife told me that it is like hard bread scratching the palate.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN THE FINE IS PAID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A rapist pays immediately. A seducer pays when he divorces her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say 'when he divorces her'? He did not marry her yet!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It means 'when he does not marry her.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Even though we learned that a seducer pays (the fine) when he does not marry her, he pays for embarrassment and blemish immediately;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding both a rapist and a seducer, she or her father can block the marriage.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding a seducer it says "Im <i>Ma'en Tima'en</i> Aviha." The repetition teaches that also she may refuse;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is the source regarding a rapist?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Answer - part 1:	"To him she will be a wife" connotes willingly. This teaches that she may refuse;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that her father may refuse?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> (This is logical. It is) in order that a sinner should not profit (to be able to marry a girl against her father's will).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We learn from a Kal v'Chomer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A seducer violated only the father's will, yet the father may refuse. A rapist violated also her will, all the more so the father may refuse!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Rava did not learn like Abaye. Since he pays a fine, it is not considered profiting if he gets to marry her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Abaye did not learn like Rava. Since a seducer can refuse to marry her, also the father may protest. A rapist cannot refuse to marry her, so the same could apply to the father!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even though a rapist pays a fine immediately, when he divorces her she has no claim against him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> He is not allowed to divorce her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, when she decides to leave him she has no claim against him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> If he dies, the fine he had paid is in place of a Kesuvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>R. Yosi bar Yehudah says, she has a Kesuvah of 100;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana holds that we enacted Kesuvah so that it will not be light in a man's eyes to divorce his wife. A rapist cannot divorce her, so we did not enact a Kesuvah for her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi bar Yehudah is concerned lest he pain her until she will want to leave him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The rapist must marry her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava of Parzika):</span> We learn from a rapist to a seducer and vice-versa. Why don't we learn that this applies also to a seducer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Regarding a seducer it says "Yimhareno <i>Lo</i> (he will take her for a wife <i>to him</i>)" - if he wants.</p></div>
