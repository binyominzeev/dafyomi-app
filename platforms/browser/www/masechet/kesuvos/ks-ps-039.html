<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A FINE AFTER DEATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> She cannot become pregnant (and give birth before becoming a Bogeres)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi - Beraisa):</span> Three women use a wad to prevent pregnancy: a minor, a pregnant woman, and a nursing woman. (Rashi - they <i>may</i> use a contraceptive wad at the time of Bi'ah. Tosfos - this is forbidden! Rather, they <i>must</i> use a wad <i>after</i> Bi'ah to remove the semen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A minor does so, lest she get pregnant and die;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>A pregnant woman does so lest the fetus get mashed (Rashi - if a second fetus is conceived; Tosfos - this is impossible. Rather, we are concerned lest there are already two fetuses inside, and semen will enter between them);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>A nursing woman does so lest pregnancy force her to wean her baby, and it will die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir says, a girl between 11 and 12 years uses a tuft. If she is younger or older, she has Bi'ah normally.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, at any age she has normal Bi'ah. Shamayim will have mercy on her - "Hash-m guards the simple."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps she became pregnant and gave birth while she was a Na'arah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> She cannot give birth in six months!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Only six months separate a Na'arah from a Bogeres.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the interim is never less than six, but sometimes it is more.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shmuel said 'only'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, Rava asked about a girl who died without children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she becomes a Bogeres after death, the father loses the fine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she doesn't become a Bogeres, her father receives the fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> Is death considered like becoming a Bogeres (i.e. does it make her leave her father's jurisdiction)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If he raped or seduced her and then she became Mekudeshes, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It does not say 'the father of the Na'arah who (even now) is not Mekudeshes'! (Certainly, the father still collects the fine.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If he had Bi'ah with her and then she had Nisu'in, she receives the fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this? It does not say 'the father of the Na'arah who is not Nesu'ah'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is no comparison. Nisu'in removes her from her father's jurisdiction, just like becoming a Bogeres;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she was raped or seduced and then became a Bogeres, she receives the fine. The same applies to if she had Nisu'in;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Kidushin does not take her from the jurisdiction of the father!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The father and husband of a Na'arah Me'orasah (Arusah) jointly annul her vows.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A RAPIST AND A SEDUCER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A seducer pays three payments: embarrassment, blemish and a fine.	A rapist pays these and also for pain;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A rapist pays a fine immediately. A seducer pays when he divorces her;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A rapist must keep her for a wife. A seducer may divorce her;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When is a rapist forced to marry her? This is even if she is lame, blind or leprous;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If he found immorality in her, or if she may not marry a Yisrael, he may not stay married to her. "She will be his wife" - she must be fitting for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> For which pain does he pay?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel's father):</span> He threw her to the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> According to this, if he threw her onto silk he is exempt?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rejection (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Yehudah) A rapist does not pay for pain, because she was destined to suffer the pain in any case, when she marries. (Her husband will not throw her on the ground! Rather, he refers to pain of the first Bi'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The pain of one who is forced is greater than that of one who willingly has Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> He pained her by opening her legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, a seducer should also pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> (She consented.) This is like one who says 'tear my silk and be exempt.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why is this like 'tear <i>my</i> silk'? The payment belongs to her father!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> Rather, wise women say that a seduced woman suffers no pain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that they (women who willingly have first Bi'ah with their husbands) do!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> My (surrogate) mother told me that it is a trifling pain, like hot water on a bald head.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> My wife told me that it is like a bloodletter's incision.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> My wife told me that it is like hard bread scratching the palate.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN THE FINE IS PAID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A rapist pays immediately. A seducer pays when he divorces her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say 'when he divorces her'? He did not marry her yet!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It means 'when he does not marry her.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Even though we learned that a seducer pays (the fine) when he does not marry her, he pays for embarrassment and blemish immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding both a rapist and a seducer, she or her father can block the marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding a seducer it says "Im <i>Ma'en Tima'en</i> Aviha." The repetition teaches that also she may refuse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the source regarding a rapist?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Answer - part 1:	"To him she will be a wife" connotes willingly. This teaches that she may refuse;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that her father may refuse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> (This is logical. It is) in order that a sinner should not profit (to be able to marry a girl against her father's will).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We learn from a Kal v'Chomer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A seducer violated only the father's will, yet the father may refuse. A rapist violated also her will, all the more so the father may refuse!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rava did not learn like Abaye. Since he pays a fine, it is not considered profiting if he gets to marry her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye did not learn like Rava. Since a seducer can refuse to marry her, also the father may protest. A rapist cannot refuse to marry her, so the same could apply to the father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even though a rapist pays a fine immediately, when he divorces her she has no claim against him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> He is not allowed to divorce her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, when she decides to leave him she has no claim against him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> If he dies, the fine he had paid is in place of a Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Yosi bar Yehudah says, she has a Kesuvah of 100;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana holds that we enacted Kesuvah so that it will not be light in a man's eyes to divorce his wife. A rapist cannot divorce her, so we did not enact a Kesuvah for her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi bar Yehudah is concerned lest he pain her until she will want to leave him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The rapist must marry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava of Parzika):</span> We learn from a rapist to a seducer and vice-versa. Why don't we learn that this applies also to a seducer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Regarding a seducer it says "Yimhareno <i>Lo</i> (he will take her for a wife <i>to him</i>)" - if he wants.</p>
