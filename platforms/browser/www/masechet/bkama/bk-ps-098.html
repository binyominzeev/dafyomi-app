<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The new coins have more weight (they are worth more to be melted down)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> A case occurred, and Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua checked with a moneychanger, and found that eight new coins equal 10 old coins (that were lent. Rashi - they ruled that eight new coins must be returned. Had they added less to the coins, the same number lent would be returned. R. Chananel, brought in Tosfos - they ruled that 10 new coins must be returned. Had they added more to the coins, only the same weight of metal lent would be returned.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS ONE LIABLE FOR MAKING A COIN UNUSABLE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If Reuven threw Shimon's coin into the sea, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The coin is there; it can be retrieved.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if the water is clear, so the coin can be seen. If the water is cloudy, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is only if he knocked Shimon's hand. If he took the coin and threw it, he stole it, and he must return the coin to Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> One may not redeem (Ma'aser Sheni) on coins not in his Reshus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he had coins in a far away place (with no safe way to get there), or if his coins fell into the sea, they may not be used.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Regarding redemption of Ma'aser, the coins must be available to him - "you will bind the money in your hand". (Normally, money on the sea floor is not considered lost.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If Reuven rubbed out the writing or picture on Shimon's coin, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not do (take away) anything!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if he pounded it with a hammer. If he filed it smooth, he removed some of the metal, so he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If a master hit his slave on his eye and blinded the eye, or on his ear and deafened the ear, the slave goes free (even though nothing is missing)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he hit him near the eye or ear, and he cannot see or hear, he does not go free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah holds that one who deafens his father is killed, for certainly he made a wound; a drop of blood fell in his ear (there is a loss).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DAMAGE THAT DOES NOT AFFECT THE INTRINSIC VALUE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If Reuven made a groove in the ear of Shimon's cow (disqualifying it from being a Korban), he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The cow is fine. Not all cows are destined to be Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven worked with Shimon's red heifer, or with his water destined to be sanctified with ashes of a red heifer (which disqualifies them), he is exempt b'Yedei Adam, but liable b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is only exempt for work, for this is not noticeable. He would be liable b'Yedei Adam for a notch in the ear, which is noticeable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he is exempt b'Yedei Adam even for a notch in the ear, which is noticeable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa teaches that even for work, which is not noticeable, he is liable b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If Reuven burned Shimon's loan document, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He can say 'I burned a mere piece of paper!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">98b----------------------------------------98b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If witnesses know what was in the document, they can write another document!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If no witnesses know what was in the document, how could we possibly obligate Reuven to pay?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, Reuven trusts Shimon to say what was written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi bar Chanina):</span> R. Shimon and Chachamim argue about Rabah's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon holds that Davar ha'Gorem l'Mamon (something that has no intrinsic value, but if it is lost, one will lose money) k'Mamon Dami (it is like property with value). He obligates for burning documents;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that Davar ha'Gorem l'Mamon is not k'Mamon. They exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> R. Shimon said (that it is k'Mamon) only regarding something that was originally worth money, like Rabah's case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If Reuven stole Shimon's Chametz before Pesach, and Levi burned it during Pesach, he is exempt, for all are commanded to burn Chametz on Pesach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he burned it after Pesach, R. Shimon, who holds that Davar ha'Gorem l'Mamon k'Mamon Dami, obligates him (for now Reuven cannot return the Chametz itself, and must pay for his theft);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim, who say that it is not k'Mamon, exempt him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We never find that R. Shimon obligates for something that never had intrinsic value!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> According to the opinion that obligates for Garmi ((Tosfos - direct) causation), he must pay the full value of the document;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that exempts for Garmi, he pays the value of the paper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>A case occurred, and Rafram forced Rav Ashi to pay the full value. (Rashi - he burned it when he was a minor.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>RETURNING SOMETHING FORBIDDEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven stole Shimon's Chametz, and Pesach passed, he can return the Chametz and say 'here is your Chametz.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of our Mishnah, who allows saying 'here is your object' even if it is Asur b'Hana'ah (forbidden to benefit from it)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Yakov;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven's ox killed, before the final verdict, if he sold it, it is sold. If he made it Hekdesh, it is Hekdesh. If he slaughtered it, the meat is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Shimon was appointed to guard it, and he returned it to Reuven's house, it is considered returned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>After the verdict (if Reuven did these things), it is not sold, it is not Hekdesh, and the meat is forbidden. If Shimon returned it, it is not considered returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yakov says, it is considered returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yakov holds that one can say 'here is your object' even if it is Asur b'Hana'ah, and Chachamim (the first Tana) hold that he cannot say this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rabah):</span> No, all agree that one can say 'here is your object', even if it is Asur b'Hana'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If that were the argument, Chachamim would not allow one to return Chametz after Pesach (but they do allow this).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> If that were the argument, the argument (here) should have been taught regarding Chametz on Pesach (lest we think they argue about something else). (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, they argue about whether or not Beis Din can sentence an ox in its absence.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim hold that they cannot sentence an ox in its absence. Reuven can say 'you made me lose my ox (by giving it over to Beis Din). Had you returned it to me, I would have hid it, it would not have been sentenced';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yakov holds that they can sentence an ox in its absence. In any case, it would have been sentenced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Shmuel - Beraisa) Question:</span> It says "he will return the stolen object." Why must it say "that he stole"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that he returns similar to what he stole;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he stole a coin and it was disqualified, produce and it rotted, wine and it soured, Terumah and it became Tamei, Chametz and Pesach came, an animal and a person slept with it or it was disqualified from being a Korban, or if (it killed but) was not yet sentenced to be stoned, he can say 'here is your object'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This Tana does not allow returning an animal after it was sentenced to be stoned, like Chachamim, yet he allows returning Chametz after Pesach! (This supports Rabah, who says that all permit returning theft that became forbidden Asur b'Hana'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>A CRAFTSMAN WHO RUINED AN OBJECT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven gave something to a craftsman to fix, and the craftsman ruined it, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he gave a chest, box or tower to a carpenter, and he ruined it, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a builder was hired to dissemble a wall, and he broke it or damaged the rocks, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was dissembling from one side, and it fell from the other side, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it fell due to the blow, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Asi):</span> The Mishnah discusses only when he gave a chest, box or tower to a carpenter to insert a nail, and in doing so, he broke it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he gave to him wood to make a chest, box or tower, and then he broke it, he is exempt, for Uman Koneh bi'Shvach Kli (a craftsman immediately acquires improvements that he makes to a Kli).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven gave something to a craftsman to fix, and he ruined it, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He gave to him wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he gave him a chest, box or tower.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa discusses when he gave a chest, box or tower. This implies that in the Reisha, he gave wood!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa explains the Reisha. He is liable when he gave a chest, box or tower.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> We must say that the Seifa explains the Reisha! If in the Reisha he gave to him wood, we would learn that Ein Uman Koneh bi'Shvach Kli. There would be no need for the Seifa to teach that he is liable for breaking a Kli!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Seifa is needed to reveal that the Reisha discusses when he gave wood, but not when he gave a Kli.</p>
