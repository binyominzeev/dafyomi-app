<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA KAMA 34 (28 Sivan) - dedicated to the memory of Hagaon Rav Yisroel Zev (ben Rav Avrohom Tzvi) Gustman, ZT'L, Rosh Yeshiva of "Yeshivas Netzach Yisrael-Ramailes" (in Vilna, Brooklyn, and then Yerushalayim), author of "Kuntresei Shi'urim," and renowned Dayan in pre-war and post-war Vilna, on the day of his Yahrzeit. Dedicated by his Talmidim Harav Eliezer Stern of Brooklyn NY, and Rabbis Mordecai Kornfeld, Avraham Feldman, Yechiel Wachtel, and Michoel Starr of Yerushalayim, who merited to learn from Rav Gustman in Yerushalayim.<br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 33-35 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the ninth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PRIORITY TO COLLECT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Even when he borrowed after the damage, since the creditor grabbed the ox first, he should collect from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This teaches that if a creditor collected before earlier creditors (and there is not enough to pay them all), his collection is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and answer to both questions):</span> No. If a creditor collected before earlier creditors, his collection stands;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A damaging ox is different. The victim says, even if you consider that the ox was yours from when you lent him, I collect it. (Regarding a Tam, the victim collects from the damager.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN THE OXEN CHANGE IN VALUE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If an ox worth 200 gored an ox worth 200, and the damage was 50, and the ox rose in value to 400, but if not for the damage, it would now be worth 800, the damager pays according to the time of damage (50. If it is Tam, it pays 25.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the victim went down in value, payments are according to the time of judgment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If the damager rose in value, it pays according to the time of damage. If it went down in value, it pays according to the time of judgment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> 'If the damager rose in value, it pays like the time of damage' is like R. Yishmael, who says that the victim is a regular creditor (he has no partnership in the animal);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Seifa says 'if it went down in value, it pays like the time of judgment.' This is like R. Akiva, who says that they are partners!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Is the Reisha like R. Yishmael, and the Seifa like R. Akiva?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The entire Beraisa is like R. Akiva. The case is, he fattened the ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why must the Reisha teach that if the damaged ox rose in value to 400, the damager pays according to the time of damage? This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The Reisha applies whether or not he fattened it. The Chidush is when it rose in price by itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Seifa is only when he fattened it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case when the damaged animal went down in value?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If this was because he overworked it, that is no reason for the damager to pay more!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It went down due to the wound. It is all due to the goring.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SPLITTING THE OXEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If an ox worth 200 gored an ox worth 200, and the carcass is worthless, in this case the Torah said "they will sell the live ox and split the money."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> You fulfilled that verse, but not "also the dead ox they will split"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, an ox worth 200 gored an ox worth 200, and the carcass is worth 50. Each gets half the live ox and half the dead ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If an ox worth 200 gored an ox worth 200, the carcass is worth 50, each gets half the live ox and half the dead ox. This is the case the Torah discusses;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> No, the Torah discusses when both were worth 200, and the carcass is worthless - "they will sell the live ox and split the money";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Also the dead ox they will split" teaches that the damager pays half the difference between the value of the gored ox when alive and after death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (When the carcass is worth 50,) both Tana'im agree that both parties end up with 125. What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> They argue about when the value of the carcass declines. R. Meir says that the victim loses. R. Yehudah says that the damager shares the loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, R. Yehudah holds that a Tam is more stringent than a Mu'ad! (We learned (10a) that regarding a Mu'ad, the victim suffers the entire loss.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> That is true!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> (If the owner guarded the animal poorly) a Tam is liable, and a Mu'ad is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rejection R. Yehudah said so only about guarding the ox, for the verses say so;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We have no source that a Tam is more stringent regarding payments!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah) Suggestion:</span> If a (Tam) ox worth 100 (Zuz) gored an ox worth 20, and the carcass is worth four, each gets half the live ox and half the dead ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This cannot be! A Mu'ad is more stringent than Tam, and Mu'ad does not pay more than the damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> They argue about when the carcass rose in value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir holds that the victim profits. R. Yehudah holds that the damager shares the profit (i.e. he pays less).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This explains R. Yehudah's Havah Amina:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Torah was lenient on the damager, to allow him half the increased value of the carcass. Perhaps if an ox worth 20 gored an ox worth 100, and the carcass is worth 50, that each gets half the live ox and half the dead ox!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Where do we find that the damager profits? Also, it says "he will pay", he will not receive!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must we also bring the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that when the victim has no loss, e.g. his animal was worth 20, and the carcass is worth 30, then both victim and damager would gain five. The verse teaches that the damager never gains.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Acha bar Tachlifa):</span> If so, R. Yehudah (has no source that the damager pays half the decrease due to the goring. Rather, we sell both and split the money, even when the damager is worth more than the victim. If so, he) holds that a Tam sometimes pays more than half- damage. However, it says "they will sell the live ox and split the money" (and R. Yehudah (37a) agrees that it pays half-damage)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> No. R. Yehudah agrees that the victim gets half the decrease in value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn this from "also the dead ox they will split";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah learned from this verse that each gets half the live ox and half the dead ox!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the verse come to teach only that, it would have said 'and the dead ox they will split';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it says "also the dead ox they will split" to teach both laws.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MONETARY LIABILITY OF ONE LIABLE TO DIE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Sometimes Reuven is liable for his ox' action and exempt for his own, and sometimes vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If his ox caused embarrassment, he is exempt. If he embarrassed, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If his ox destroyed a limb of Reuven's slave, he is exempt. If he did so, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If his ox wounded his father or mother, or burned something on Shabbos, he is liable. If Reuven did so, he does not pay, for he is liable to die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Avahu - Beraisa):</span> All who ruin (on Shabbos) are exempt, except for one who wounds or burns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yochanan):</span> Don't teach this way. It is wrong!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It could be true only if one wounds to feed the blood to his dog, or burns to get the ashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question: (against R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> If his ox burned something on Shabbos, he is liable. If he did so, he does not pay, for he liable to die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case in which he burned is like when his ox burned. Just like his ox does not burn for a need, also he, and he is liable to die!</p>
