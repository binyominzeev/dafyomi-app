<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 18-20 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the ninth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ATTEMPTS TO ANSWER RAVA'S QUESTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If chickens were pecking at the rope of a bucket, and the rope snapped and the bucket broke, they pay full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This proves that it depends on the beginning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No, the Beraisa teaches that they pay full damage for the rope.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is abnormal to peck at a rope!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There was dough on the rope.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If he pays for the rope, why did the Beraisa mention the bucket?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> The Beraisa is like Sumchus, who says that Tzeroros pay full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> If a fragment flew off (the bucket) and broke a Kli, he pays full damage for the first Kli, and half-damage for the second;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Sumchus, he should pay full damage for both Kelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Sumchus distinguishes between impetus and impetus of impetus (the damager set something in motion, it set something else in motion that later damaged).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Ashi never resolved this!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Does Sumchus consider impetus of impetus like impetus, or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If the Beraisa is like Sumchus, this shows that he does not consider it as impetus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The Beraisa is like Chachamim. Impetus is like bodily damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> No. The case is, the chicken was pushing the bucket the entire time, until it broke.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DO TZEROROS PAY MIN HA'ALIYAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Is half-damage of Tzeroros paid from ha'Aliyah (even above the value of the damager)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We never find half-damage that pays from ha'Aliyah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>On the other hand, we never find normal damage that pays mi'Gufo (only up to the value of the damager)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> Dancing (of chickens) is not Mu'ad;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say, it is Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, dancing is Mu'ad!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the chickens danced and strewed up pebbles, which broke a Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Tana who says that it is not Mu'ad holds that it pays from ha'Aliyah. The other Tana says that it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they argue like Sumchus and Chachamim (like above).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> If a dog took a cake (with a coal inside) to a pile of grain, and it ate the cake and burned the grain, it pays full damage for the cake and half-damage for the grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is because burning the grain is like Tzeroros.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Half-damage is paid (for the grain) up to the value of the dog.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This settles Rava's question!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be! R. Elazar holds that full damage is paid even for the grain. We never find full damage mi'Gufo! (Rava asks only according to Chachamim. Surely, Sumchus, who obligates full damage for Tzeroros, holds that it pays from the Aliyah, like a Mu'ad.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we must say that the dog acted abnormally with the coal. R. Elazar holds like R. Tarfon, who says that Keren in the victim's premises pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Defense #1 (of Answer #2):</span> We need not say that R. Elazar holds like R. Tarfon, or that the damage was abnormal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can say that he holds like Sumchus, and like R. Yehudah (who says that half the obligation of a Mu'ad is like a Tam. The Tam part only pays mi'Gufo. Rava's question is settled, like above.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sama brei d'Rav Ashi):</span> R. Yehudah said so in cases where the animal was initially Tam. We have no source to say this about something (Tzeroros, according to Sumchus) that is Mu'ad from the beginning!</p>

<p class="bas bbbline"></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Defense #2 (Rav Sama):</span> R. Elazar says that it became Mu'ad for damage through Tzeroros.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana holds that Tzeroros cannot become Mu'ad. R. Elazar holds that they can.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava never resolved this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Can Tzeroros become Mu'ad?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Rav Sama, Chachamim say that they cannot, and R. Elazar says that they can!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava asked (whether Tzeroros can become Mu'ad) according to Chachamim who argue with Sumchus. R. Elazar and his Chachamim (those who argue with him) all hold like Sumchus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If R. Eliezer's Chachamim hold like Sumchus, they should obligate full damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim obligate half-damage for the cake because it was abnormal, and it did not become Mu'ad for this. R. Elazar and his Chachamim argue like R. Tarfon and his Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Tarfon said that Keren in the victim's premises pays full damage. Do we have any source that it pays only mi'Gufo?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! He learns from a Kal va'Chomer, from Keren in Reshus ha'Rabim. The principle of Dayo (a Kal va'Chomer cannot teach more than the source) dictates that it only pays mi'Gufo.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Tarfon disagrees with the principle of Dayo!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He argues only when the Kal va'Chomer does not teach anything new (e.g. we knew half-damage without the Kal va'Chomer). Once we learn a Chidush (e.g. full damage), he agrees to Dayo.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN <i>TZEROROS</i> BECOME <i>MU'AD</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Can Tzeroros become Mu'ad?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we compare them to Keren (they can become Mu'ad)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since they are a Toldah of Regel, they cannot become Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> Dancing (of a chicken) is not Mu'ad;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say, it is Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, dancing is Mu'ad!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, a chicken danced and strewed up pebbles.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The chicken has done this three times. They argue about whether or not it becomes Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they argue about the first time it happens, like Sumchus and Chachamim argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Amora'im argue about Rava's question.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If an animal excreted on a dough, it pays full damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar says, it pays half-damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The animal has done this three times three times; they argue about whether or not it becomes Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. They argue the first time it happens, like Sumchus and Chachamim argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But this is abnormal! (Why does Rav Yehudah obligate full damage?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It had no other place to excrete, so it was normal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yehudah should have said 'the Halachah follows Sumchus', and R. Elazar should have said 'the Halachah follows Chachamim'! (Why did they teach about a particular case?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a Chidush in the law of excrement. One might have thought that since it comes from the body, all agree that it is like bodily damage. They teach that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rami bar Yechezkel - Beraisa):</span> If a chicken stuck its head into a glass Kli and cackled, breaking it, it pays full damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If a horse or donkey neighed and broke Kelim, it pays half-damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They did so three times. They argue about whether or not it becomes Mu'ad.</p>
