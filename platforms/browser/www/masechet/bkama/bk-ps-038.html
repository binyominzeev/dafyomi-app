<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>NOCHRI'S</i> OX</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Yisrael's ox gored a Nochri's ox, the Yisrael is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the since for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If "Shor Re'ehu" is a condition to be liable, a Nochri's ox that gored a Yisrael's ox should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If "Shor Re'ehu" is just a typical case, but the Torah obligates even other cases, a Yisrael's ox that gored a Nochri's ox should also be liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu):</span> "...(Hash-m) saw va'Yater (and scattered) Nochrim" - He saw that they were not keeping their seven Mitzvos, v'Hitir (and He permitted) their money to Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> "(Hash-m) Hofi'a (appeared) from Mount Paran" - from Paran (when the Nochrim refused to accept the Torah), Hofi'a (He exposed, i.e. permitted) their money to Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael's ox gored a Nochri's ox, it is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a Nochri's ox gored a Yisrael's ox, whether it is Tam or Mu'ad, it pays full damage. It says "...(Hash-m) saw va'Yater Nochrim", and "(Hash-m) Hofi'a from Mount Paran".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are both verses needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we need the first verse to teach like Rav Masnah and Rav Yosef (as follows).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REWARD AND PUNISHMENT OF <i>NOCHRIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Masnah):</span> "...(Hash-m) saw va'Yater Nochrim" - He saw that they were not keeping their seven Mitzvos, and exiled them from their land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that va'Yater connotes exile?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lenater (to jump) with them (extra legs of grasshoppers) on the ground".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "...Ra'ah va'Yater..." - Hash-m saw that they were not keeping their seven Mitzvos, and released them from their Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Do they gain from their sins?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar brei d'Ravina):</span> No. He teaches that even if they fulfill their Mitzvos, they are not rewarded for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "(The Mitzvos) that a man will do and live in them" - it doesn't say that Yisraelim will do, rather that a man will do!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that a Nochri who engages in Torah is (rewarded) like a Kohen Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are not rewarded like one who is commanded, rather like one who is not commanded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Romi sent two officers to learn the Torah; Chachamim taught them. They acknowledged the truth of every point, except for one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The officers:</span> How can it be that a Yisrael's ox that gores a Nochri's ox is exempt, but a Nochri's ox (even a Tam) that gores a Yisrael's ox pays full damage?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If "Shor Re'ehu" is a condition to be liable, a Nochri's ox that gored a Yisrael's ox should be exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If "Shor Re'ehu" is not a condition, also a Yisrael's ox that gored a Nochri's ox should be liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The officers said that they would not tell this to the authorities.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah's daughter died. Rabanan asked Ula to go with them to console him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> The consolation they give in Bavel is blasphemy! They say 'what can one do', which implies that if one could do (differently than Hash-m did), he would!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ula went alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Ula):</span> "Do not afflict Mo'av, and do not start war with them" - why would Moshe think to wage war if not commanded?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> Moshe made a Kal va'Chomer: Midyan only came to help Mo'av, and we were commanded to strike them. All the more so, we should strike the Mo'avim!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">38b----------------------------------------38b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> No. Two special women will convert, Rus the Mo'avis and Na'amah the Amonis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> Hash-m spared two nations due to two women that would convert from them. If your (Rav Shmuel's) daughter was proper, and good would have come from her, all the more so Hash-m would have kept her alive!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Hash-m doesn't withhold reward for anything, even for nice words!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Lot's older daughter (brazenly) called her son Mo'av (from father). Hash-m commanded "do not afflict Mo'av, and do not start war with them", but we may subjugate them to pay taxes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Lot's younger daughter (modestly) called her son Ben Ami (son of my nation). Hash-m commanded "do not afflict (Amon), and do not subjugate them" - at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> One should always do Mitzvos at the first opportunity!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Because Lot's older daughter slept with him one night earlier than her sister, she merited four generations of descendants in Yisrael before a descendant of her sister entered Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Oved (Rus' son), Yishai, David and Shlomo descend from the older daughter. Rechavam, Shlomo's son from Na'amah, descends from the younger daughter.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DAMAGES TO AND OF <i>KUSIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Yisrael's ox gored a Kusi's ox, it is exempt. If a Kusi's ox gored a Yisrael's ox, a Tam pays half-damage, and a Mu'ad pays full damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, if a Kusi's ox gored a Yisrael's ox, whether Tam or Mu'ad, it pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Meir holds that the Kusim converted due to lions (that were eating them. Their conversion was invalid, and they are Nochrim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> All (blood) stains that come from Rekem are Tehorim. (We are not concerned that it is from a (Yisraelis) Nidah, for we assume that it is from a Nochris);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, they are Teme'im, because converts live there and they err (act like Nochrim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Stains that come from places where Nochrim live are Tehorim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Meir says, stains that come from places where Yisraelim and Kusim live are Teme'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim say, they are Tehorim, for they are careful about hiding away Tamei stains.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> R. Meir is Metamei stains of Kusim. He must hold that they are true converts!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (and rejection of Inference - R. Avahu):</span> Really, they are valid converts. R. Meir fined them, lest Yisraelim intermarry with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira - Mishnah):</span> If one who rapes or entices a virgin Na'arah, pays the fine (of 50 Shekalim): a Mamzeres, a Nesinah, a Kusis...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If R. Meir fines them monetarily, he should also fine them not to receive this fine!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He does not want a sinner (the man who raped or enticed her) to profit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should say that the fine goes to the poor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mari):</span> The rapist would avoid paying. He could tell any poor man 'I will give it to someone else.'</p>
