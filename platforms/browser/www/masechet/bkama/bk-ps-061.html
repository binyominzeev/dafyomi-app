<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>KING DAVID'S QUESTION (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Huna and Rabanan, we understand "David did not want to drink" (to rely on the special right of a king).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rava what does this mean? (He merely received an answer!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He would not say the law in their names.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>David had received from Shmuel that we do not say laws in the name of one who endangered his life to learn Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Huna and Rabanan, we understand "he poured them for an offering to Hash-m" - he acted for the sake of Heaven (he did not rely on the special right of a king);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rava, what does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He said the law (anonymously) like a tradition.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A FIRE THAT SPREAD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a fire passed a wall of four Amos, Derech ha'Rabim (a public road) or a river, one is exempt (for what burned on the other side).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If a fire passed a wall of four Amos, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah teaches about walls of descending heights. If the wall was six Amos, he is exempt, and also if it was five, until (and including) four;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa teaches about walls of ascending heights. If the wall was two Amos, he is liable, and also if it was three, until (but not including) four.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A wall of four Amos exempts, even in a field of thorns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The four Amos are measured above the thorns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Mishnah applies only to a flame that rises. A low (or bent) flame is liable even for crossing a wall (Tosfos; Rashi - road) of 100 Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah applies only to a low (or bent) flame. A flame that rises is exempt even for crossing a wall (road) of any size.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav - Beraisa):</span> This applies only to a flame that rises. A low (or bent) flame where wood is found is liable even for crossing a road of 100 Mil (one Mil is 2000 Amos, about a kilometer);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it crossed a river or Shlulis (explained below) eight Amos wide, it is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it crossed Derech ha'Rabim...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> (One is exempt if it crossed a road) 16 Amos wife, like the width of Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Or a river...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This literally means a river.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if it is dry, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It refers to a small irrigation ditch.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is exempt only if has water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are a division regarding Pe'ah (they require one to leave a part of the field unharvested (for the poor) on each side of the division): a Nachal (river; some say, valley), a Shlulis, a private path, or a public road.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Shlulis?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is a place where rainwater Sholelim (gathers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Bivi):</span> It is an irrigation ditch that apportions Shalal (profit) to its banks (by supplying water).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yehudah would say that all the more so, an irrigation ditch is a division;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Bivi would not agree about a place where rainwater gathers. That is a mere basin of the field.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE LIMIT OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> If Reuven lit a fire in his own premises (and it spread to his neighbor), how far must it be from the fire to his neighbor for Reuven to be exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> It must be like the distance from the middle of a Beis Kor (to the edge, about 137 Amos);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Eliezer):</span> It must be 16 Amos, like Reshus ha'Rabim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Akiva):</span> It must be 50 Amos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Shimon):</span> "The one who burned the fire will pay" - it is according to the fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction:</span> Elsewhere, R. Shimon limits responsibility for a fire!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not set up a Tanur (oven) in his house unless there are four Amos above it. One may not set up an oven in an upper story unless there are three Tefachim of plaster below it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>For a Kirah (a kind of oven that does not get as hot as a Tanur), one Tefach suffices.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the oven caused damage, he must pay for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon says, if he kept the proper distance, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> R. Shimon holds that the distance is always according to the size of the fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>LIABILITY FOR SOMETHING CONCEALED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If Reuven burned a stack, and Kelim were inside and they burned, he pays for them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, he only pays for a stack of wheat or barley (whatever it was).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven burned a stack of grain, and there was a goat tied to it and a slave nearby, and they were burned, Reuven is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there was a slave tied to it and a goat nearby, and they were burned, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim admit to R. Yehudah that one who burns a building pays for everything inside, for people normally put (all kinds of) things in houses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Kahana):</span> They argue about when Reuven lit in his own premises, and it spread to Shimon's property: R. Yehudah obligates him for what was hidden, and Chachamim exempt him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he lit a fire in Shimon's premises, all obligate him for what was hidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, why does the Seifa say 'Chachamim admit to R. Yehudah that one who burns a building pays for everything inside, for people normally hide things away in houses?' It should distinguish regarding the case of a stack!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It should say that Chachamim exempt only when Reuven lit in his own premises. If he lit in Shimon's premises, all agree he is liable for what was hidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, they argue in both cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Reuven lit in his own premises and it spread to Shimon's property, R. Yehudah obligates him for what was hidden, and Chachamim exempt him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he lit a fire in Shimon's premises, R. Yehudah obligates even for anything hidden, even a wallet. Chachamim obligate for Kelim that are sometimes put in a stack, such as tools used for threshing and with cattle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If Reuven burned a stack, and Kelim were inside and they burned, he pays for them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Chachamim say, he pays only for a stack of wheat or barley. We view the place of the Kelim as if it were grain.</p>
