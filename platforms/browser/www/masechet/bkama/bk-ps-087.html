<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LAWS THAT DO NOT APPLY TO A BLIND PERSON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Yehudah):</span> A blind person does not pay for embarrassment. Also, he is exempt from all monetary laws of the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "The Tzibur will judge between the murderer and the avenger (the victim's relative) according to these Mishpatim (monetary laws)" - only those who are liable for murder are liable for Mishpatim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3 - R. Yehudah):</span> A blind person does not pay for embarrassment. Also, he is exempt from all Mitzvos of the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "These are the Mitzvos, statutes and Mishpatim" - only those who are liable for Mishpatim are commanded about Mitzvos and statutes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef (who was blind):</span> At first, I hoped to hear that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah (that a blind person is exempt from Mitzvos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He would get a greater reward for doing Mitzvos, even though he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rav Yosef):</span> After hearing R. Chanina's teaching, I hope to hear that the Halachah does not follow R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> One who is commanded and fulfills gets a greater reward than one who is not commanded and fulfills.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the Halachah were unlike R. Yehudah, Rav Yosef would get a greater reward for the Mitzvos, because he is commanded.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>GENERAL RULES OF PAYING FOR DAMAGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Torah was stringent about a man who damages, to obligate him to pay Nezek, pain, medical expenses, Sheves, and embarrassment, and compensation for a fetus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An ox only pays Nezek, it is exempt from compensation for a fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One who strikes his father or mother and does not make a wound, or one who strikes a person on Yom Kipur is liable for all damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One who strikes a Yisrael slave is liable for all damages, except for Sheves if it is his own slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One who strikes another's Kena'ani slave is liable for all damages;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah says, embarrassment does not apply to slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>One loses from encounters with a Cheresh, lunatic or child. One who damages any of them is liable. If any of them damaged someone, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>One loses from encounters with a slave or (married) woman. One who damages either of them is liable. If either of them damaged someone, he or she is exempt now, but pays later;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the slave is freed or the woman is divorced, then he or she is liable to pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>One who strikes his father or mother and makes a wound, or one who strikes a person on Shabbos is exempt from all damages because he is liable to die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>One who strikes his Kena'ani slave is exempt from all damages.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HITTING CHILDREN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Elazar) Question:</span> If Reuven hit Shimon's daughter (a minor), does he pay to her or to Shimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah gave Shevach Ne'urim (what a girl earns or receives (e.g. for Kidushin) throughout the period that she is a minor or Na'arah) to the father. Perhaps this also applies to damages;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should this be?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Her value decreased.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps the Torah gave to the father only Shevach Ne'urim such as Kidushin money, for a repulsive person would pay Shimon money to let him marry Shimon's daughter. However, Shimon has no Reshus (jurisdiction) over wounding his own daughter, so money paid for damages is hers!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">87b----------------------------------------87b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> The Torah gave to the father only Kidushin money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> One who strikes a Yisrael slave is liable for all damages, except for Sheves if it is his own slave. (Since a girl's labor belongs to her father, the Halachah should be the same!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Rav admits that the father receives the Sheves, since he owns her labor until Bagrus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> If Reuven hit his son, if the son is an adult, Reuven pays him immediately. If the son is a minor, he buys something lasting.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven hit his daughter (a minor), he is exempt. If Shimon hit Reuven's daughter, he pays Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses the Sheves.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CHILDREN WHO FEED THEMSELVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one hit his son (an adult), he pays immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> If one hit another's sons or daughters, if they are adults, he pays them immediately. If they are minors, he buys something lasting</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one hit his own sons or daughters, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one feeds his children, he is exempt (if he hits them). If they feed themselves, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beraisa #1 cannot discuss children that feed themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa of Beraisa #1):</span> If he hit his daughter (a minor), he is exempt. Further, if he hit another's daughter, he pays her father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she feeds herself, she must receive the money!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Even according to the opinion that a master can tell his slave 'work for me, and I will not feed you' says so only about a Kena'ani slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The master can make him work all day; and the slave can pursue his food at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A master cannot tell his Yisrael slave 'work for me, and I will not feed you', for it says "it is good for him with you." He is with you regarding food and drink (he eats no worse than his master)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>All the more so, a man cannot tell his daughter 'work for me, I will not feed you'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can answer like Rabah brei d'Rav Ula said (elsewhere, that the father gets) the money above what she needs to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beraisa #2 cannot discuss one who feeds his children. It says that if one hit another's sons or daughters, if they are adults, he pays them immediately. If they are minors, he buys something lasting;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The father should receive the money (since he is feeding them)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A man who feeds his children is insistent not to lose money (e.g. if he hits them, he should not pay). He does not mind if they get money from another source (e.g. when someone else hit them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He is insistent to receive lost items that they find!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Clarification of Answer:</span> He is insistent to get money they get from another source if it came without bodily pain to them; he is not insistent to get money which came through bodily pain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that he is insistent to receive money they get from another source that came through bodily pain!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> Further, if he hit another's daughter, he pays her father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to an exacting father. He does not feed his children. He is insistent to get money they get from another source;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Beraisa #2, the father feeds his children. He is insistent not to pay them, but he is not insistent to get money they get from another source.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the 'something lasting'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is a Sefer Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> It is a tree from which they eat dates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The Torah gave to the father only Shevach Ne'urim money (like Rav holds).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even if someone bruised her, her father gets the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can that really be?! Even R. Elazar only asked about a blow that decreases her value, not a bruise that does not decrease her value!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> R. Yochanan refers to a bruise on the face that decreases her value.</p>
