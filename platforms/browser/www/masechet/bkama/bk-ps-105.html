<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA KAMA 105 (10 Elul) - This Daf has been dedicated in honor of the Yahrzeit of Sheina Basha (daughter of Yakov and Dora) Zuckerman, who passed away on 10 Elul, by her children and sons in law. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LESS THAN A <i>PERUTAH</i> OF A STOLEN OBJECT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the son should also pay the Chomesh (for his own false oath)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Chomesh is not paid for denial of money when there is a lien on land to pay it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (i) - Rava):</span> The case is, the father had deposited the stolen object with others;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The son pays the principal, for the stolen object is intact;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He does not pay the Chomesh, for he swore truthfully. He did not know where it was.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LESS THAN A <i>PERUTAH</i> OF A STOLEN OBJECT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon pardoned the entire obligation, except for less than a Perutah of the principal (Reuven need not travel to return it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Papa):</span> This is only when the stolen object is not around. If it is around, he must return it, lest it rise in value to a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Papa):</span> This is even if the stolen object is around. We are not concerned lest it rise in value to a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven stole three (equal) bundles, worth a total of three Perutos, and they declined in value, they are now worth two Perutos, and he returned two, he must (even travel to) return the third.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If one stole Chametz, and Pesach passed, he can say 'here is your Chametz.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he did not have the Chametz to return, he would need to pay its original value, even though now it is worthless!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also in Rava's case, since it was worth a Perutah when he stole it, he must return it, even though it is not worth a Perutah now.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If Reuven stole two bundles, and their total worth is one Perutah, and he returned one, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he is not holding (a Perutah of) stolen property, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he stole (a Perutah) and has not returned (a Perutah), he must return the other?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He is not holding a Perutah of stolen property, nor has he returned the theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since he is not holding a Perutah of stolen property, he has returned all he must return!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava meant, even though he is not holding a stolen object worth a Perutah, he did not yet fulfill the Mitzvah of returning (therefore, he must return it).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO DID LESS THAN THE MINIMUM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a Nazir shaved (at the end of his Nezirus) and left two hairs uncut, it is as if he did not shave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If he shaved one of the remaining two, and the other fell out, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> Does Rava ask if a Nazir may shave one hair at a time? (Surely, he may!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> No, he asks about when one of the remaining two fell out before he shaved the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since no hair remains, it is as if he shaved (and he may drink wine);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, since he left two hairs (and was obligated to shave them), and one fell out before he shaved either, he did not fulfill the Mitzvah (and he may not drink wine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Two hairs do not remain; he did not shave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since two hairs do not remain, he has shaved all he must shave!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava meant, even though two hairs do not remain, he did not yet fulfill the Mitzvah of shaving (so he may not drink wine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a barrel was punctured, rendering it unable to block Tum'as Mes (Rashi - from passing to the upper story, if it rests in the opening in between; Tosfos - from entering the barrel, which is of earthenware and has a flush cover), and the hole was sealed with dregs, the barrel can block the Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one corked half the hole [and now the hole is less than the Shi'ur], what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yemar):</span> A Mishnah answers this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a barrel was punctured, and sealed with dregs, this saves it [from Tum'ah];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he (partially) plugged up the hole with a twig (so the remaining holes on each side are not large enough to disqualify a barrel from blocking Tum'ah), this helps only if he plasters it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he used two twigs, he must put plaster in between and on both sides of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Without plastering, it is not considered sealed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [If corking half the hole helps, even without plaster] this should be as if he sealed half the hole! (Rather, corking half does not help.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> If twigs are not plastered, they will not stay in place, so it is as if nothing was sealed. If he corked half, it will stay [even without plaster].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OATHS TO DENY MONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven stole Shimon's Chametz, and Pesach passed, he can say 'here is your Chametz.'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">105b----------------------------------------105b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If he swore falsely (that he did not steal it), is he liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since if the Chametz would be stolen from Reuven, he would have to pay Shimon, it is as if he swore to deny money (he is liable);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since now it is here, and it is worthless, his oath did not matter (he is exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This was not a question for Rabah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If Yehudah had Levi's ox, but denied that he stole it and swore 'I am a Shomer Chinam', and later admitted, he is liable, because his oath would have exempted himself if the ox was lost or stolen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he swore 'I am a Shomer Sachar' and later admitted, he is liable, because this would have exempted him if it was injured or died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he swore 'I borrowed it' and later admitted, he is liable, because this would have exempted him had it died while working.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even though now the animal is here, he is liable because his oath might have saved himself money (if it was lost or died...);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Similarly, Reuven is liable because his oath could have saved himself money (if the Chametz was stolen)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Amram - Beraisa):</span> "He denied it" excludes one who admits from the beginning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yehudah had Levi's ox, but denied that he stole it. He swore to one of the following claims-- you (or your father) sold or gave it to me, it chased after my cow, it came by itself, I found it straying on the road, I am a Shomer Chinam or Shomer Sachar, or I borrowed it. He later admitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "He denied it" excludes one who admits from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The Beraisa discusses a case of Heilach (he returns the animal immediately). I discuss when the animal is in the swamp (he does not return it immediately).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa mentions an oath 'you sold it to me.' This is not admission from the beginning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yehudah admits that he never paid for it, and says 'take it back for payment.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa mentions 'you (or your father) gave it to me.' This is not admission from the beginning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yehudah admits that the gift was on condition that he act nicely to Levi, and that he did not fulfill this. He says 'take it back.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One case is 'I found it straying on the road.' Since he knew that it was Levi's, he should have returned it. Keeping it is like stealing it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel's father):</span> He claims that he did not know that it was Levi's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Ben Azai):</span> If Reuven asked David to testify about Reuven's Aveidah, and David swore falsely that he knows no testimony, and later David admitted that he knew, there are three cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He says 'I knew that it was yours, but I did not know that Shimon found it (perhaps he bought it from you)';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He says 'I knew that Shimon found it, but I did not know that it was yours';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He says 'I did not know that it was yours, nor that Shimon found it.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, David swore truthfully!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he says 'I knew that it was yours, and that Shimon found it.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Ben Azai come to teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ami):</span> In all three cases, the witness is exempt (from the Korban for a false oath that he does not know testimony).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> In all three cases, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>R. Ami and Shmuel argue like the following Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one imposes an oath on one witness that he does not know testimony (and he swore falsely), the witness is exempt (from a Korban, because the testimony of one witness cannot force someone to pay);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon obligates him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar holds that something that can cause a loss of money is considered like money. The first Tana holds that it is not like money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm"></p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span></span>DOES DENIAL MAKE ONE A THIEF?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> If one denies a deposit, he is considered a thief, and he is liable even for Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa) Question:</span> "And he denied it" teaches the punishment (this will be explained). Where does the Torah warn not to do this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Do not deny."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Version #1 (our text, Tosfos) Suggestion:</span> 'The punishment' refers to money ("he will return the theft" obligates him for Ones, until he returns it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it means that he must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi) Suggestion:</span> 'The punishment' (liability for Ones) is because of his denial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is for swearing falsely. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa discusses when he swore. This implies that in the Reisha, he did not swear!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa) Question:</span> "And he swore falsely" teaches the punishment. Where does the Torah warn not to do this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Do not lie."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also the Reisha discusses swearing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Seifa, he later admitted (so he pays principal, Chomesh and offers an Asham);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the Reisha, witnesses testified against him (and he is liable even for Ones).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama - Mishnah):</span> A defendant is suspected to swear falsely (and may not swear, so the claimant swears and receives like he claimed) if he (ever) swore falsely that he does not know testimony, or about a deposit, or took a vain oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one becomes a thief just for denying a deposit, denial alone should disqualify him from swearing (in the future), even if he did not swear (just like a thief is disqualified)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the deposit is (an animal) in the swamp. If he denied without swearing, we assume that he is not trying to steal, he is just stalling until he can return it.</p>
