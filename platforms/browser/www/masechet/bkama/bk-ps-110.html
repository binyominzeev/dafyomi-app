<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>KOHEN</i> MAY OFFER HIS OWN <i>KORBANOS</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How old or sick is he?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he can serve, he himself should offer them and get the meat and skin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he cannot serve, why can he choose a Kohen to be his Shali'ach? (He should need to give them to Kohanim of the division!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> He can serve (and eat) with difficulty. Since such service is valid, he can make a Shali'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Eating with difficulty is like gorging oneself. Such eating is invalid, therefore, Kohanim of the division get the meat and skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> If a Tamei Kohen (of the serving division) has a Korban of the Tzibur to offer, he gives it to any Kohen he wants. Kohanim of the division get the meat and skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there are Tahor Kohanim (in the division), Tamei Kohanim may not serve! (Why can he give it to any Kohen he wants?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If there are no Tahor Kohanim, why do Kohanim of the division get the meat? They cannot eat it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The only Tahor Kohanim in the division have blemishes. (They may not offer, but they may eat.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> If the Kohen Gadol was an Onen (i.e. one of his close relatives died today), he gives his Korban to any Kohen he wants. Kohanim of the division get the meat and skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Why did Rav Ashi need to teach this?) A Mishnah teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Kohen Gadol may serve when he is an Onen, but he may not eat Kodshim, nor does he receive a portion to eat at night (when he is permitted to eat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Torah was merciful to allow a Kohen Gadol to serve when he is an Onen, but not to appoint a Kohen to offer on his behalf. Rav Ashi teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>ASHAM</i> FOR THEFT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven stole from a convert and swore falsely to him, and the convert died, Reuven pays principal and Chomesh to the Kohanim, and brings an Asham - "if the man has no redeemer... the theft that is returned to Hash-m, to the Kohanim, aside from the ram of atonement..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven was bringing the money and Asham to the Mikdash and died, his heirs inherit the money. The Korban grazes until it gets a blemish. It is sold, the money is used for a Olah of the Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he gave the money to Kohanim of the division and then died, his heirs cannot take it back - "a man who will give to the Kohen, it will be to him (the Kohen)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he gave the money to Yehoyariv (a particular division of Kohanim), and the Asham to Yadayah (the division that serves after Yehoyariv), he was Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he gave the Asham to Yehoyariv, and the money to the Yadayah, if the animal is still around, Yadayah offers it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If not, he must bring another Asham. If one gave the money before bringing the Asham, he was Yotzei. If one brought the Asham before giving the money, he was not Yotzei (he was not Yotzei).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he gave the principal but not the Chomesh, he may bring the Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa #1):</span> "Asham" is the principal. "That is returned" is the Chomesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Asham" is the Korban Asham!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference would it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This would teach us that the Halachah does not follow Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one gave the theft to the Kohanim at night, or in two payments, he was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah calls it "Asham" (which cannot be offered at night or in two installments).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Aside from the ram of atonement" refers to the Asham, so "Asham" must refer to the principal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> "Asham" is the principal. "That is returned" is the Chomesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Asham" is the Chomesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference would it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It would teach unlike our Mishnah, which says that if he gave the principal but not the Chomesh, he may bring the Asham. Rather, we would learn that he may not bring the Asham until he pays the Chomesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "He will return his Asham b'Rosho and its fifth" teaches that "Asham" (cannot mean Chomesh, so it) is principal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3):</span> "Asham" is the principal. "That is returned" is the Chomesh. The verse discusses one who stole from (and swore falsely to) a convert who later died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "that is returned" is Kefel, and it discusses one who covertly stole from a convert!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "He will return his Asham b'Rosho, and its fifth" refers to money that is paid b'Rosho (only one principal).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CONDITIONS OF THE PAYMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven gave the theft to the Kohanim at night, or in two payments, he was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah calls it "Asham" (which cannot be brought at night or in two installments).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If every Kohen (in the division) does not get a Perutah, the thief did not fulfill his obligation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah calls it "Asham that is returned (...to the Kohen)" - it must be returned to every Kohen (less than a Perutah is not considered money).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If it is not enough for every Kohen in Yehoyariv to get a Perutah, but it is enough for every Kohen in Yadayah, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">110b----------------------------------------110b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he gave it to Yadayah when Yadayah is serving, surely this is good!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he gave to Yadayah when Yehoyariv is serving.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since Yadayah is not serving, this is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, since the theft is not fitting for Yehoyariv (it is too small), it is destined to be given to Yadayah, so it is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This question is unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> May Kohanim trade portions that they received of Gezel ha'Ger?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the Torah called it Asham, just like they may not trade one Korban for another, also Gezel ha'Ger;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since it is mere money, they may trade it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Since the Torah called it Asham, they may not trade it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Acha brei d'Rava cited this teaching in his father's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Is a Kohen who received Gezel ha'Ger like an heir, or like one who received a gift?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reuven stole Chametz from a Ger, and Pesach passed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he is like an heir, he inherits the worthless Chametz;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he is like one who received a gift, Reuven must give him something of value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ze'ira):</span> Even if he is like one who received a gift, the Torah told Reuven to return what he stole (even if it is worthless)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ze'ira):</span> If a Kohen received 10 animals for Gezel ha'Ger, must he tithe them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is like an heir, we learned that if orphans bought animals with money of the estate, they must tithe them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he like one who received a gift, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who buys or receives a gift of animals is exempt from tithing them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Twenty-four gifts were given to the Kohanim. They are all included in a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal, and a covenant of salt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one fulfills them, it is as if he fulfilled (the whole Torah, which is expounded using) Klal u'Frat u'Chlal, and (all the Korbanos, for which there is) a covenant of salt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one does not fulfill them, it is as if he transgressed the whole Torah and all the Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Ten of the gifts may only be eaten in the Mikdash - Korban Chatas of animals and birds, Asham brought for a definite or Safek Aveirah, Korban Shelamim of the Tzibur (on Shavuos), (the remains of) the Log (about a half liter) of oil that a Metzora brings, the remains of the Omer offering (on Pesach, after offering a handful on the Mizbe'ach), the Lechem ha'Panim (the bread that is on the Shulchan the entire week), the two loaves brought on Shavuos, and the remains of Menachos (flour-offerings).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Four of the gifts are (eaten or received) in Yerushalayim - Bechor (a firstborn male, of Tahor) animals, Bikurim, the chest and foreleg of Shelamim and of the ram that a Nazir offers, and the hides of Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Ten of the gifts apply even outside Yerushalayim:</span> Terumah, Terumas Ma'aser, Chalah, first shearings (of sheep), the foreleg, jaw and stomach of Chulin Behemos, redemption of firstborn sons, redemption of Bechor donkeys, Sdei Achuzah (a field from one's ancestral inheritance that he made Hekdesh and did not redeem before Yovel), a field declared Cherem, and Gezel ha'Ger.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Beraisa calls Gezel ha'Ger a gift.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>UNEXPECTED RESULTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven gave the money to Kohanim of the division (and then died, the Kohanim keep it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We learn from this that the money partially atones. If it did not, we should say that it reverts to Reuven's heirs!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reuven gave it only to get atonement.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, if the owner of a Korban Chatas died, we should say that it reverts to Chulin, for he made it Hekdesh only in order to offer it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A tradition from Moshe from Sinai teaches that if the owner of a sin-offering dies, the animal is left to die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, if the owner of an Asham died, we should say that it reverts to Chulin, for he made it Hekdesh only in order to offer it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A tradition from Sinai teaches that in any situation in which a Chatas must die, an Asham grazes (until it gets a blemish. We buy and offer an Olah of the Tzibur with the money).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A woman who falls to Yibum to a leper should be exempt without Chalitzah. She did not accept Kidushin with intent that she would fall to such a Yavam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely, she accepts Kidushin in spite of this possibility, due to Reish Lakish's teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> A woman prefers being married (even to an undesirable man) than to remain single.</p>
