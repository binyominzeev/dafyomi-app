<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 33-35 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the ninth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO ENTERED THE <i>RESHUS</i> IN WHICH HE WAS DAMAGED (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (Rav Zvid - Beraisa):</span> "And it found" excludes a victim who brought himself to be damaged;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, this teaches that if Reuven threw a stone, and Shimon stuck out his head and was killed, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> He is exempt from exile, but he is liable in four payments of damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Version #3 obligates for four damages even when the victim brought himself to be damaged. All the more so, it obligates in the cases of Versions 1 and 2 (when the shop owner knew that someone entered, he is more negligent);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Versions 1 and 2 obligate in four damages when the shop owner knew he had entered, but if Shimon brought himself to be damaged, Reuven would be totally exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If workers came to demand their wages from their boss, and one was bitten by the boss' dog, the boss is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Others say, workers are entitled to demand payment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the boss can be found in the city, why do Others permit them to enter to demand wages?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the boss is usually at home, what is the reason for the first Tana?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the boss is sometimes at home. The workers called at the porch, and the boss said 'yes'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first holds that 'yes' means 'come in.' The second Tana holds that 'yes' means 'wait there'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The following Beraisa is like the opinion that 'yes' means 'wait there'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a worker came to demand his wages from his boss, and he was gored or bitten by the boss' ox or dog, the boss is exempt, even though the worker had permission to enter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the boss said 'yes', and this means, 'wait there'. (The Beraisa means 'even though the worker thought that he had permission to enter').</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OXEN THAT DAMAGED EACH OTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Two oxen damaged each other. If they are Tamim, they (i.e. whichever damaged more) pay half the excess damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If they are Mu'adim, they pay all the excess damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one is Tam and one is Mu'ad, if the Mu'ad damaged more, it pays all the excess damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Tam damaged more, it pays half the excess damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Similarly, if two men damaged each other, they pay all the excess damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If a man and a Mu'ad ox damaged each other, they pay all the excess damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If a man and a Tam ox damaged each other, if the man damaged more, he pays all the excess damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Tam damaged more, it pays half the excess damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, even a Tam that damaged a man pays all the excess damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Like this law will be done to it" - just like when an ox damaged an ox, a Tam pays half the excess damage, and a Mu'ad pays full damage, the same applies to a Tam or Mu'ad that damaged a man;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Akiva says, "like this law" - like the latter law (Mu'ad, which was mentioned last), not like the former (Tam).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps (a Tam that damaged a man) pays even more than its value!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Will be done to it" - it pays only from its body.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from "this"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This exempts the ox from the four damages (other than Nezek).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Akiva's source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "a man who will wound his fellowman", not an ox that will wound a man.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold that if we had only R. Akiva's verse, one might have thought that it is exempt only for pain (for the victim does not lose money due to it), but it pays medical expenses and Sheves. Therefore, we need also "this".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PAYMENTS OF A <i>TAM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an ox worth 100 gored an ox worth 200, and the carcass is worthless, the victim takes the damager.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> The ox is evaluated in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, the ox itself is taken.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yishmael holds that the victim is like a creditor. The damager owes him money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Akiva holds that they are (usually) partners in the ox that damaged (the victim's share is according to the damage. In this case, he entirely owns the damager.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>They argue about "they will sell the live ox and split its money." R. Yishmael holds that this is an instruction to Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Akiva says, the verse addresses the victim and the damager.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Practically, what difference is there between R. Yishmael and R. Akiva?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about if the victim made the damaging ox Hekdesh (According to R. Akiva, it takes effect. According to R. Yishmael, it does not.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> According to R. Yishmael, if the damager sold the ox, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the victim is only a creditor, the sale is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since the victim has a lien on the ox, it is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The sale is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The sale is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The sale is valid, but the victim may collect it from the buyer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the victim may collect it from the buyer, in what sense is it sold?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The buyer may work with it until the victim takes it. (Rashi - if the buyer worked with it, he does not pay the victim for the work.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If a debtor sells Metaltelim, Beis Din takes them from the buyer to pay the creditor?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Damages are a special case. It is as if the damaging animal is an Aputiki (collateral designated for collection of the loan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava taught that if a man made his slave an Aputiki and sold it, Beis Din collects from the slave. If he made his ox an Aputiki and sold it, Beis Din does not collect from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They collect from a slave because it becomes known that it was made an Aputiki. (The buyer knew that it might be collected. Word does not spread when an ox is made an Aputiki);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When an ox gores, it becomes known, for people call it a goring ox!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SALE OF A <i>TAM</i> OX THAT DAMAGED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(Rav Tachlifa bar Ma'arava - Beraisa) If he sold the ox, it is not sold. If he made it Hekdesh, it is Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who sold the ox?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The damager sold it. Since his sale is invalid, the Beraisa must be like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If he made it Hekdesh, it is not Hekdesh. This is like R. Yishmael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the victim sold it. Since his sale is invalid, the Beraisa be like R. Yishmael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If he made it Hekdesh, it is not Hekdesh. This is like R. Akiva!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, the damager sold it. The Beraisa is like both Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he sold it, it is not (permanently) sold. This is even according to R. Yishmael, for the victim has a lien on it (and can collect it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he made it Hekdesh, it is Hekdesh. This is even according to R. Akiva, due to R. Avahu's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> (If one was Makdish his property, and creditors had a lien against it, really, it is not Hekdesh. The creditor takes the property, and pays a small amount to Hekdesh. It is not a real redemption.) This is a decree, lest people say that Hekdesh becomes Chulin without redemption.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Tam damaged, before Beis Din judges the case, if it was sold or made Hekdesh, this stands. If it was slaughtered or given for a gift, what was done was done;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After Beis Din judges the case, if it was sold or made Hekdesh, this is invalid. If it was slaughtered or given for a gift, nothing happened;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If (other) creditors collected it, whether the damager borrowed before or after the damage, the collection is invalid, for a Tam pays only from itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If a Mu'ad damaged, before or after Beis Din judges the case, if it was sold or made Hekdesh, this stands. If it was slaughtered or given for a gift, what was done was done;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If creditors collected it, whether the damager borrowed before or after the damage, the collection is valid, because a Mu'ad pays from the owner's pocket.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Explanation:</span> (Before Beis Din judges the case,) if he sold it, it is sold. I.e. if the damager sold it, it is sold regarding work;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If he made it Hekdesh, it is Hekdesh. I.e. a redemption is required, like R. Avahu taught. (Hekdesh Damim (something not used for the Avodah, but Hekdesh sells it and uses the money) cannot overcome the victim's lien on it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If it was slaughtered or given for a gift, what was done was done.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, a gift stands. The receiver may work with it until it is collected;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if it was slaughtered, the victim may still collect, from the meat!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the victim can collect only when the ox is alive!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "They will sell the ox" applies even after slaughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shizbi):</span> It says 'what was done was done', for a slaughtered animal is worth less.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> If Reuven damages land on which Shimon has a lien, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, we can infer this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we cannot infer this. Here, the slaughterer only took the wind (life) out of the animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah already taught this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If Reuven burned Shimon's documents, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that there he can say 'I burned only paper', but for a real action, such as digging pits on a field (which decreases the value), he would be liable. The case of a damaging ox teaches that this is not so</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If creditors collected it, whether the damager borrowed before or after the damage, the collection is invalid, because a Tam pays only from itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Granted, when he borrowed after the damage, the victim has precedence to collect; 1.  However, when he borrowed before the damage, the creditor should have precedence!</p>
