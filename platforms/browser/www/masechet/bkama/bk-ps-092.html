<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TREES THAT HARM VINES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Shmuel's sharecropper brought to him dates. Shmuel tasted wine in them, and asked why.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The sharecropper:</span> The trees are between vines.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> They are weakening the vines. Uproot them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rav Chisda saw date trees among his vines. He told his sharecropper to uproot them, because vines are more profitable than date trees.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ATONING FOR DAMAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even though the damager pays the victim, he must ask the victim for forgiveness - "return his (Avraham's) wife to him (and he will pray for you)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he does not forgive, he is cruel - "Avraham prayed... and Hash-m cured Avimelech..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(If Reuven told Shimon) 'blind my eye', 'cut off my hand', (or) 'break my foot', and Shimon did so, he is liable, even if Reuven said 'on condition that you will be exempt';</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he said 'tear my garment' or 'break my jug', and Shimon did so, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'on condition that you will be exempt', he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If Reuven told Shimon to damage Levi's body or property, even if he said 'on condition that you will be exempt', Shimon is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> All the fixed payments (for Toke'a, slapping... - 90a) are only for embarrassment. For the anguish he caused, Korbanos cannot atone until he requests his forgiveness - "return the man's wife and he will pray for you, for he is a prophet."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he was not a prophet, would he not need to return his wife?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> In any case, he must return his wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Avimelech argued "will you kill an innocent person? He said 'she is my sister...'" Hash-m responded "he is a prophet." Avraham had taught that when a guest comes to a city, people should ask whether he has to eat and drink, and not 'is the woman with you your wife or your sister?';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>From here we learn that a Ben Noach is liable for not having learned what he should have learned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The double expression "Ki Atzor Atzar" teaches that Hash-m had closed the place where a man emits semen, and where a woman emits semen (that she received from a man) and gives birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It teaches that He had closed the place where a man emits semen and urine, and where a woman emits semen and urine and gives birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> It teaches that the places of emission of semen, urine and excrement (in men and women) and birth (in women) were all closed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(D'Vei R. Yanai):</span> "(Had closed) every womb" - even hens of Avimelech's house did not lay eggs.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Rabanan say that if Reuven prays for Shimon for something that Reuven himself needs, that Reuven will get it first. What is the source of this?</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "Avraham prayed... and Hash-m cured Avimelech and his wife and slaves... and Hash-m conferred (pregnancy) upon Sarah like He said" - like Avraham said about Avimelech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> People say 'in uprooting the thorn, also the cabbage is stricken (uprooted - i.e. neighbors of the wicked suffer with the wicked).' What is the source of this?</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> "(Yosef) took some of his brothers, five men." Which did he take?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Mari citing R. Yochanan):</span> He took the ones whose names were mentioned twice (in Moshe's Berachah, to strengthen them, for they were weak).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yehudah is mentioned twice (and he was the strongest)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The extra mention was to remedy his problem;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "Reuven should live and not die... and this is to Yehudah" - all 40 years in the Midbar, Yehudah's bones were dissembled in his coffin (due to the excommunication he accepted on himself if he will not return Binyamin) until Moshe prayed for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> Yehudah (through admitting about Tamar) caused Reuven to admit (about Bilhah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>(Moshe asked) "Hash-m, hear the voice of Yehudah" - Yehudah's bones assembled, but he could not enter the Heavenly Yeshivah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>"Bring him to his people" - (he entered), but he could not understand and debate with the Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>"His hands are great for him" - he could argue with them, but he did not merit that the Halachah follows him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>"And You will aid him from his opponents" - he merited that the Halachah follows him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> People say that poverty breeds poverty. What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar Mari - Mishnah):</span> The rich would bring Bikurim in gold and silver baskets (and take back the baskets). The poor would bring in wicker baskets, and the Kohanim kept the baskets.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "He (the Metzora) will cry Tamei, Tamei" (he will increase his plight).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar Mari):</span> "They will not be hungry or thirsty, and heat and sun will not strike them (because they already ate)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "You will serve Hash-m" refers to saying "Shema Yisrael" and prayer in the morning. "And He will bless your bread and water" refers to (eating) bread with salt and a flask of water, after which "I will remove sickness from your midst."</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Mari):</span> We learn this from the Torah, the prophets, and the writings (Tosfos - of Ben Sira);</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The Zarzir (starling) does not dwell with the raven for no reason. It is the same species.
