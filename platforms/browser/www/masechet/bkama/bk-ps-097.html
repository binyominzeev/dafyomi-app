<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MUST ONE PAY FOR USING STOLEN PROPERTY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rav really hold that slaves are like land?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Daniel citing Rav):</span> If Reuven grabbed Shimon's slave and made the slave work for him, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If slaves are like land, the slave always belonged to Shimon. Shimon should own the labor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he used the slave when the slave does not work:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba):</span> If Levi lived in Yehudah's yard without Yehudah's knowledge, must he pay rent?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> He is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The cases are different!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There, Levi benefits Yehudah, both according to the opinion that an inhabited house is settled (the dweller tends to its upkeep), and according to the opinion that Sheidim damage desolate houses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here, Shimon loses. His slave is weaker (because he was working)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, it benefits Shimon that his slave not get used to idleness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>People of Rav Yosef bar Chama's household would take slaves (of people who owed them money) and work with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava (his son):</span> Why do you do this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> This is like Rav Nachman taught, that a slave is not worth the food that he eats (I feed them when I use them. I benefit the owners!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Rav Nachman said that only about his own slave Daro, who dances in bars to get drinks. Normal slaves work!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I hold like Rav Daniel citing Rav, who says that if Reuven grabbed Shimon's slave and used the slave, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Shimon is happy that people use his slaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Since you take slaves of people who owe you, this looks like Ribis!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef bar Minyomi):</span> If Levi lived in Yehudah's yard without Yehudah's knowledge, he is exempt. If Yehudah owes him money, Levi must pay rent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef bar Chama:</span> I retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Reuven grabbed Shimon's boat and used it, Shimon may demand the normal rental, or the depreciation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He gets only the depreciation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (Rav Papa):</span> They do not argue. Rav discusses a boat that is normally rented. Shmuel discusses a boat not normally rented.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> Both discuss a boat normally rented. Rav discusses when Reuven intended to rent it, and Shmuel discusses when he intended to steal it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DISQUALIFIED COINS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he stole a coin and it cracked...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> 'Cracked' is understood literally. 'Disqualified' means that the kingdom disqualified the coin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If the kingdom disqualified the coin, this is also considered 'cracked'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is the case of disqualified?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This province disqualified it, but it is accepted in other provinces.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda, of Rav Huna):</span> You say that 'disqualified' means in the whole kingdom. However, fruit that rotted and wine that soured are similar to this, and there, he pays like at the time of the theft!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> There, the taste and smell changed. Here, the coin did not change.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah of Rav Yehudah):</span> You hold that if the whole kingdom disqualified the coin, this is as if it cracked (and he pays like the time of the theft). This is like Terumah that became Tamei, and there he can say 'here is your Terumah!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> There, the damage is not noticeable. Regarding the coin, one can see that it is unlike the coins being used.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CURRENCIES OF OTHER KINGDOMS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Reuven lent Shimon money, and the currency was disqualified, Shimon must pay with a currency that is accepted;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">97b----------------------------------------97b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Shimon can return the same currency, and say 'you can use it in Meishan (a far away place in which it is still accepted).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Presumably, Shmuel's law is only when Reuven needs to (Rashi; Rashba - can) travel to there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> We may not redeem Ma'aser Sheni on currency that is not accepted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he had coins of Ben Koziva or of previous kings, they may not be used.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A similar case of coins of contemporary kings (i.e. they may not be used here) may be used for redemption.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> One may use the coins if the king does not mind if people use currency of other kingdoms.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We must say that Shmuel's law is when the kings object to use of other currencies. If so, the money will be confiscated!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They object to using other currencies, but they do not search people for other currencies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> In Bavel, we may not redeem Ma'aser Sheni on coins of Yerushalayim, nor vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We may redeem on coins of Bavel in Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The Beraisa forbids redemption on Yerushalayim coins in Bavel, even though the owner will come to Yerushalayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the kings object to use of other coins and search people for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why may we redeem in Bavel with coins of Bavel? One cannot take them to Yerushalayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One can buy an animal, and take it to Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #2):</span> It was enacted that all coins be accepted in Yerushalayim for this reason (that people brought foreign currencies. Why does Beraisa #1 forbid redeeming on coins of Bavel in Yerushalayim?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> When Yisraelim rule in Yerushalayim, all coins may be used. When others rule, only Yerushalayim coins may be used.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The coin of Yerushalayim says 'David and Shlomo' on one side, and 'Yerushalayim, the holy city' on the other side;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The coin of Avraham said Yitzchak and Rivka on one side, Avraham and Sarah on the other.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>REPAYING IN A DIFFERENT CURRENCY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If Reuven lent Shimon in a coinage, and they increased the (weight of) the coins, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> He must return coins that are accepted now.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Is this even if the new coins are much bigger?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> These coins can buy more food! (This is Ribis!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> If they buy more because they are bigger, he only returns coins with the same purchasing power. If the price of food declined, he returns the same monetary amount, even though it can buy more.</p>
