<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE STRINGENCIES OF EACH TYPE OF DAMAGER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are stringencies of an ox over a pit, and vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Stringencies of an ox over a pit:</span> an ox pays Kofer if it kills a person, and 30 Shekalim if it kills a slave. One may not benefit from an ox sentenced to be killed, and its nature is to move and damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Stringencies of a pit over an ox:</span> a pit is prone to damage from the beginning, and it is Mu'ad (pays full damage) from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>There are stringencies of an ox over a fire, and vice- versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Stringencies of an ox over fire:</span> an ox pays Kofer, and 30 Shekalim for a slave. One may not benefit from an ox sentenced to be killed. One is liable for handing over an ox to a Cheresh, lunatic or child;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The stringency of fire over an ox:</span> fire is Mu'ad from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>There are stringencies of fire over a pit, and vice- versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Stringencies of a pit over fire:</span> a pit is prone to damage from the beginning, and one is liable for handing over a pit to a Cheresh, lunatic or child;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Stringencies of a fire over a pit:</span> its nature is to move and damage, and it is liable even for things unfitting for it to consume.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa should also teach that an ox is liable for Kelim, but a pit is not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Yehudah, who obligates a pit also for Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> A fire is liable even for things unfitting for it to consume, but a pit is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered fit and unfit for a fire to consume?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Wood is fit, and Kelim are unfit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Since the Beraisa exempts a pit, it cannot be like R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Beraisa is like Chachamim. The Beraisa did not list all the stringencies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1:</span> Really, the Beraisa can be like R. Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It obligates a fire even for things unfitting for it to consume, i.e. scorching a plowed field or rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> The Beraisa should also teach that an ox is liable for damaging blemished Korbanos, but a pit is not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Answer #2, the Beraisa is like Chachamim. We can say that also this case was omitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, according to the opinion that the Beraisa is like R. Yehudah, the Beraisa would not omit only one case. What else was omitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It omits an ox that threshed in a plowed field (this does not apply to a pit).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is included in 'its nature is to move and damage'!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A PARTIAL DAMAGER THAT PAYS FULL DAMAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who is responsible for part of the damage...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One who is responsible for part of the damage is responsible for all of the damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, Reuven dug a nine Tefachim pit, and Shimon completed it to 10 Tefachim. Shimon is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> This is unlike Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If Reuven dug a nine Tefachim pit, and Shimon completed it to 10, Shimon is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says, Shimon is liable for death (if an animal dies in the pit). Both are liable for damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Our Mishnah (like Beraisa #1 explained) is even like Rebbi. It refers to liability for death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> It is even like Rebbi. It refers to liability for death. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> This is not the only case when one responsible for part of the damage is responsible for all of the damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one handed an ox over to five people, and one of them (Reuven) was negligent (and left), and it damaged, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If it cannot be guarded without Reuven, obviously, he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it could be guarded without Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, he is exempt! (We conclude that R. Zeira's question is ill-founded. There is no Chidush in his case that should be taught.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Mishnah should also teach the case of adding fuel to a fire!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the fire would not have spread without the extra fuel, obviously, he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it would have spread without the extra fuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, he is exempt! (Rav Sheshes' question is ill-founded.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> It should also teach the case of the following Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If five men sat on a bench without breaking it, and a sixth man sat on it, and it broke, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The sixth man was fat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it would not have broken without him, obviously, he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it would have broken without him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, he should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, the Beraisa teaches a Chidush. What is it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, without him, it would have broken in two hours. Because he sat on it, it broke in one hour.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The others can say 'had you not sat on it, we would have left before it broke!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He can say 'without the five of you, I would not have broken it alone!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Really, it would not have broken without him. The case is, he did not sit on it. He only leaned on the men sitting on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that (damage caused by) his force is unlike (damage by) his body. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so. (Presumably, the Mishnah did not teach this case, for the last man did all the damage.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah should also teach the case of the following Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If 10 men hit Reuven, each with a different stick, and he died, whether this was at the same time or one after the other, they are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira says, if they hit him one after the other, the last one is liable, for he hastened the death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah discusses damages, not death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We do not list cases about which there is an argument.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We were willing to establish the Mishnah unlike Rebbi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can say that the Mishnah is like Rebbi, unlike Chachamim. We will not establish it like an individual (R. Yehudah ben Beseira), unlike Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHO GETS THE CARCASS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who is responsible to pay for the damage...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Mishnah does not say 'one who is responsible for the damage', rather, 'one who is responsible to pay for the damage'. This teaches like the following Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> 'Payments for his damage' (taught in the Mishnah) teaches that the owner (of an animal that was killed) takes the carcass (i.e. he receives the difference between the value of a live animal and the carcass).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ami):</span> We read "one who strikes an animal Yeshalmenah (will pay for it)" like 'Yashlimenah (will complete it, i.e. pay the decreased value)'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Kahana):</span> "He will bring Ed (a witness), the Tereifah he will not pay" - we read this 'Ad (up to the difference between a live animal and a Tereifah, he will pay. For) the Tereifah (itself), he need not pay (rather, he gives back the Tereifah)'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Chizkiyah):</span> "The carcass will be to him" - to the victim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei Chizkiyah) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is to the damager!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is not that way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> If it were to the damager, the Torah should have said only 'an ox for an ox.' It added "the carcass will be to him" to teach that it is to the victim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>We need all these verses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had the Torah taught only about a man who strikes an animal, one might have thought that is because it is uncommon; but Tereifos are common, perhaps there it is to the damager (Shomer);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only about a Tereifah, one might have thought that this is because it died by itself, but if one struck an animal, the carcass would be to the damager;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had it taught only about these two cases, we would attribute the law to the above reasons (it is uncommon, or the man actively damaged); but it is common for an animal to fall in a pit and it happens by itself, so the carcass would be to the damager. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> Without the verse "the carcass will be to him", could we really think that the damager must keep the Neveilah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He will return" teaches that (anything) worth money may be given, even bran. 2.  Summation of question: The damager can pay with (even other) carcasses if he wants, all the more so with the victim's carcass!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> The verse teaches that the victim suffers any loss in value of the carcass from the time of damage until the payment.</p>
