<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ANOTHER CASE THE MISHNAH TEACHES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Tzad ha'Shavah of them (their nature is to damage...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> One left a stone, knife or load on top of his roof, and they fell in a common wind and damaged.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they damaged while they were falling, this is exactly like fire (we would not need to learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Another force participates. They are your money and you are responsible to guard them. This is just like fire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they damaged after they came to rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the owner was Mafkir them, Rav and Shmuel agree that this is a pit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are prone to damage from the beginning, they are your money and you are responsible to guard them. This is just like a pit (we would not need a Tzad ha'Shavah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he was not Mafkir them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> According to Shmuel, even if he was not Mafkir them, this is exactly like a pit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, he was Mafkir them. This is unlike a pit, for another power participated;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We need to learn from fire that participation of another power does not exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from fire. Fire moves and damages!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a pit that even stationary damagers are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is the Tzad ha'Shavah of the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (b) - Rava):</span> The Tzad ha'Shavah teaches about a pit (i.e. an obstacle) that is kicked around by people and animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the owner was Mafkir them, Rav and Shmuel agree that this is a pit;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They are prone to damage from the beginning, they are your money and you are responsible to guard them. This is just like a pit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he was not Mafkir them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even so, according to Shmuel, this is exactly like a pit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, he was Mafkir them. This is unlike a pit, which damages due to the owner's action (digging it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, the damage is not due to the owner's action (rather, to the one who kicked it to the place where it damaged!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>We learn from an ox that one is liable even when the damage is not due to the owner's action.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from an ox, it normally moves and damages!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a pit that even stationary damagers are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is the Tzad ha'Shavah of the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DAMAGES FROM PERMITTED ACTIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 1:b - Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The Tzad ha'Shavah includes the following case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may empty his waste water or the refuse of his cave into the Reshus ha'Rabim in winter, but not in summer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though this is permitted, he is responsible for any resulting damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If they damaged before they came to rest - this is a result of his action (i.e. this is a man who damages. We need not learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they damaged after they came to rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the owner was Mafkir them, Rav and Shmuel agree that this is a pit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are prone to damage from the beginning, they are your money and you are responsible to guard them. This is just like a pit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Answer #1 Rather, he was not Mafkir them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> According to Shmuel, this is exactly like a pit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, he was Mafkir them. This is unlike a pit, for one may not dig a pit (in Reshus ha'Rabim). Here, the owner did not transgress!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>We learn from an ox that one is liable even when the owner did not transgress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from an ox, it normally moves and damages!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a pit that even stationary damagers are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is the Tzad ha'Shavah of the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (to Question 1:b - Ravina):</span> The Tzad ha'Shavah teaches the following case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a wall or a tree fell into a Reshus ha'Rabim and damaged, the owner is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Beis Din fixed a time by which he must cut his tree or destroy his wall, if they fell within this time, he is exempt; if they fell after this time, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he was Mafkir them, Rav and Shmuel agree that it is a pit;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The damage is common, they are your money and you are responsible to guard them. They are just like a pit!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he was not Mafkir them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> According to Shmuel, this is exactly like a pit!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, he was Mafkir them. They are unlike a pit, which is prone to damage from the beginning. These were not prone to damage from the beginning;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We learn from an ox that one is liable even when they are not prone to damage from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from an ox, it normally moves and damages!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a pit that even stationary damagers are liable. This is the Tzad ha'Shavah of the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PAYMENTS OF DAMAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He must pay for the damage (from the best of his land).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "From the best of his field and vineyard he will pay" - from land equal to the best land of the victim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says, the verse teaches that damages are collected from Idis (highest quality land), Kal va'Chomer to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yishmael, does he pay from Idis, whether he damaged Idis or Ziburis (low quality land)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> The case is, a patch of the field was consumed, and we are unsure which one. He pays for Idis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If we knew that he ate Ziburis, he would pay Ziburis. Since we are in doubt, the one who wants to collect must bring proof!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Acha bar Yakov):</span> The case is, the damager's Idis is like the victim's Ziburis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael holds that the payments are like the victim's Idis. R. Akiva holds that the payments are like the damager's Idis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yishmael's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns a Gezeirah Shavah "Sadeh-Sadeh" (the field from which payments are made is like the damaged field).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva expounds "from the best of his field and vineyard he will pay" - the field of the one who pays.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yishmael learns from the Gezeirah Shavah and from R. Akiva's verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He learns from the Gezeirah Shavah, like above;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He learns from R. Akiva's verse, e.g., if the damager had Idis and Ziburis, and his Ziburis is not as good as the victim's Idis, he must pay with his Idis.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>HEKDESH</i> COLLECTS FROM <i>IDIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> The verse teaches that damages are collected from Idis, Kal va'Chomer to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Kal va'Chomer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It teaches about when a man's ox gored a Hekdesh ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Torah obligates for goring "the ox of his fellowman", not the ox of Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, a man said 'it is upon me to give a Maneh to Hekdesh.' The Kal va'Chomer teaches that Hekdesh collects from his Idis.</p>
