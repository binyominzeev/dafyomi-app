<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHERE ONE MAY RETURN THEFT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven received a deposit, stole or borrowed from Shimon in a settled area, he may not return to him in the Midbar (wilderness);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he received a deposit or borrowed from him on condition to go to the wilderness, he may return it in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Contradiction:</span> A loan may be paid anywhere. An Aveidah or deposit may be returned only to its place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa means that one may demand payment of a loan anywhere. One may only demand an Aveidah or deposit in its place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (If he received a deposit or borrowed from him) on condition to go to the Midbar (he may return it in the Midbar).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches about the following case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon told Reuven 'take this deposit, for I am going to the wilderness', and Reuven replied 'also I am going to the wilderness.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reuven meant 'if I want, I will return it to you there.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO IS UNSURE WHETHER OR NOT HE OWES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven tells Shimon 'I stole, received a deposit or borrowed from you, and I do not know whether I paid you', he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven is unsure whether or not he stole, received a deposit or borrowed, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna and Rav Yehudah):</span> If Levi tells Yehudah 'you stole, received a deposit or borrowed from me', and Yehudah says that he does not know, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman and R. Yochanan):</span> He is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Huna and Rav Yehudah obligate him, for a definite claim prevails over a doubtful claim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Nachman and R. Yochanan exempt, for we leave the money in its status quo.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Huna - Mishnah):</span> If he says 'I do not know whether or not I stole, received a deposit or borrowed from you' he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Shimon does not claim from him, we must say so also in the Reisha. If so, why is he liable?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he claims from him, and the Seifa exempts him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to question (1)):</span> Really, Shimon does not claim from him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Reisha, Reuven wants to fulfill his obligation b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> If Levi said to Yehudah 'you stole, received a deposit or borrowed from me', and Yehudah says 'I don't know', if he wants to fulfill his obligation b'Yedei Shamayim, he is liable (even though R. Yochanan exempts b'Yedei Adam).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>RETURNING THEFT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven stole a lamb and returned it to the flock, and it died or was stolen, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the owner did not know about its theft or return, and/or counted the flock and found that it was complete, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> If the owner knew about its theft, he must be informed of its return (for the thief to be exempt). If he did not know of its theft, if he counted the flock after its return, the thief is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Mishnah, 'and counted the flock' refers to the Seifa (the owner did not know of its theft or return).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Whether or not the owner knew of its theft, if he counted the flock after its return, the thief is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Or counted the flock' refers to the entire Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If the owner knew of its theft, if he counted the flock after its return, the thief is exempt. If he did not know of its theft, even if he does not count the flock, the thief is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Or counted the flock' refers to the Reisha (the owner knew of its theft).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If the owner knew of its theft, if he counted the flock after its return, the thief is exempt. If he did not know of its theft, the owner must know of its return.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Or counted the flock' refers to the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why does Rav Chisda require explicit knowledge of return when the owner never knew that it was stolen?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">118b----------------------------------------118b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Once the animal was exposed to new pastures, it needs to be guarded better. The owner must know that he has such an animal in his flock.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This contradicts another teaching of Rava!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven saw Ploni take from Reuven's flock, and he cried out, and Ploni dropped the animal, and Reuven does not know whether it returned, and the animal died or was stolen, Ploni is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is even if Reuven counted his flock after the theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is only if he did not count it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav contradicts another of his teachings!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one returned it to the flock in the Midbar, he is exempt (even if the owner did not know and did not count them)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chanan bar Aba):</span> Rav admits about a spotted animal (surely he noticed its loss, and the shepherd saw that an animal was added to the flock).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Amora'im argue like the following Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> If one stole a lamb from the flock or a coin from a wallet, he should return to the place he stole from;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, the owner must know that it was returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We are thinking that all hold like R. Yitzchak.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> One constantly checks his wallet.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The owner knows that the coin was stolen. R. Yishmael holds like Shmuel (it suffices that the owner counted his money after it was returned). R. Akiva holds like Rav (he must know that it was returned);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The owner does not know that the lamb was stolen and returned. R. Yishmael holds like R. Yochanan (it suffices to return it to its place). R. Akiva holds like Rav Chisda (he must know that it was returned).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Zvid):</span> If a Shomer stole from the owner's premises, all agree like Rav Chisda (the owner must know);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about a Shomer who stole from his own premises.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, he is no longer a Shomer, so he must return it to the owner. R. Yishmael says, he continues to be a Shomer, so he may return to the place he stole from.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not the owner's counting exempts the thief.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If Reuven stole from Shimon, and in a subsequent transaction, Reuven gave to Shimon more than he should have, in order to return the theft (without telling him), he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> He was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We are assuming that all hold like R. Yitzchak.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> One constantly checks his wallet.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana #1 (of Beraisa #1) holds that the owner's counting exempts the thief. Tana #2 holds that it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree that the owner's counting exempts the thief;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #1:</span> They argue about R. Yitzchak's law. Tana #1 agrees to it, and Tana #2 does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #2:</span> They agree to R. Yitzchak's law. One Beraisa discusses putting the money in Shimon's wallet, and the other discusses putting it in his hand. (Rashi - if he put it in his wallet, surely Shimon will notice it. If he put it in Shimon's hand, perhaps he will put it in his moneybox, not his wallet, and will not know that the theft was returned. Meiri - one notices what is put in his hand, but sometimes does not notice what is put in his wallet, like the coming explanation.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #3:</span> In both Beraisos, he put the money in Shimon's wallet. In Beraisa #1, there was no other money in the wallet at the time. In Beraisa #2, there was other money in the wallet at the time (and he did not know how much - Rashi. Meiri - some explain oppositely. When there is no other money, he does not check to see how much there is.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>BUYING FROM SHEPHERDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not buy wool, milk or kids from shepherds (perhaps they stole them);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We may not buy fruit or wood from people who guard fruit;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We may buy from women woolen garments in Yehudah, linen garments in Galil, and calves in Sharon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If the seller says to conceal it, it is always forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Everywhere, one may buy eggs and chickens.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> We may not buy from shepherds: goats, kids, Gizim (shearings) or bits of wool taken off the sheep;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We may buy garments. (Even if they stole the wool), they acquired it by changing it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>We may buy from them milk and cheese in the wilderness, but not in a settled area.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>We may buy four or five goats or sheep, or four or five Gizim, but not two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Yehudah says, we may buy home animals (those that stay near the house), but not Midbariyos (those normally far from the house).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The general rule is, we may buy only things that the owner will realize they are missing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa permits four or five goats or sheep, or four or five Gizim. If four are permitted, there is no need to say five!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It means that if he has five, we may buy four of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> We may buy four from a small flock, or five from a big flock.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa permits four or five. This implies that three is forbidden. It forbids two, which implies that three is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may buy three healthy animals, or four or five weak ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> We may buy home animals, but not Midbariyos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which law does R. Yehudah refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he qualify the allowance to buy four or five, and restricts this to home animals, but four or five Midbariyos are forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does he qualify the Isur to buy two, and restricts this to Midbariyos, but two home animals are permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> We may buy home animals, but not Midbariyos. We are always allowed to buy four or five.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that he qualifies the Isur to buy two.</p>
