<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HITTING SLAVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven hit Shimon's Kena'ani slave, he is liable... (R. Yehudah says, Boshes does not apply to slaves).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "When men will fight, a man with his brother" refers to people who have (according to Halachah) brothers. This excludes slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim disagree. Since also a slave is commanded to keep Mitzvos, he is called a brother of a free man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yehudah, Edim Zomemim who tried to kill a slave should not be killed. It says "like he plotted to do to his brother"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "You will eradicate the evil from your midst" includes this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim should say that a slave is qualified to be king (even though we must appoint a king from "your brothers")!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> All agree that a convert is called your brother, but he may not be appointed king!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> "From the midst of your brothers" - connotes from the best (lineage) of your brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim should say that a slave is qualified to testify - "he testified falsely about his brother"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> A Kal va'Chomer disqualifies slave from testimony;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even women, who may marry a Yisrael, cannot testify. All the more so slaves, who cannot marry into Yisrael, may not testify!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Circumcision does not apply to women. Perhaps slaves, to whom circumcision applies, can testify!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see that minors cannot testify, even though they are fit for circumcision.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Children are exempt from Mitzvos. Perhaps slaves, who are commanded to fulfill Mitzvos, can testify!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Women are commanded in the Mitzvos, yet they cannot testify! (This shows that this is not the criterion);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The stringent sides of women and children are dissimilar. We learn from the common side: they are not commanded about all the Mitzvos, and cannot testify. The same applies to slaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Women and children are not men. We cannot learn to disqualify adult male slaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a robber (just like he cannot testify, also a slave).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> His sin disqualified him. We cannot learn to a slave!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the common side of a robber, and a woman or minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar brei d'Ravina):</span> "Fathers will not die due to children" - one is not sentenced to die through testimony of fathers who have no connection (lineage) to their children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse cannot mean that a father will not die though testimony of his children. If so, it should have said 'fathers will not be put to death due to their children'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, it means like we said.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should similarly learn from "children will not be put to death due to fathers" that one is not sentenced to die through testimony of children who have no lineage to their fathers, to disqualify converts (but this is false)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Converts have no lineage to their parents, but they have lineage to their children. The verse excludes slaves, who have no lineage, not to their parents nor to their children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had the Torah wanted to disqualify converts, the verse would say 'children will not die due to their fathers', to teach that a father is not sentenced to die through testimony of his children;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>''And children will not die due to fathers" would teach two laws:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Children are not sentenced to die through testimony of their fathers;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>No one is sentenced to die through testimony of people who have no lineage to their fathers (converts);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">We would then learn a Kal va'Chomer:</span> if converts are disqualified, even though they have lineage to their children, all the more so slaves, who have no lineage to their parents or children, are disqualified!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since the Torah did not write this. It must be that converts can testify, only slaves are disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah should have written 'and children will not be put to death due to their fathers.' Why did it write "and children will not be put to death due to fathers", which connotes that no one is sentenced to die through testimony of people who have no lineage to their fathers!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the verse starts "fathers will not be put to death due to children", the verse continues "and children will not be put to death due to fathers."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS KINYAN PEROS LIKE KINYAN HA'GUF?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One loses through encounters with a Cheresh, lunatic or child.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The mother of Rav Shmuel bar Aba of Hegronya wrote a document giving her Melug property to Rav Shmuel. After she died, R. Yirmiyah bar Aba ruled that Rav Shmuel gets the property.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">88b----------------------------------------88b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah):</span> Shmuel taught that if a woman sold her Melug property in her husband's lifetime, and she died, her husband takes the property from the buyer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmiyah):</span> I ruled like a Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven wrote a document giving his property to his son after Reuven's death, the son may not sell the property, because it is under the father's Reshus. The father may not sell it, for he wrote a document giving it to his son.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the father sold it, the sale stands until the father dies. If the son sold it, the buyer does not get it until the father dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> When the father dies, the buyer gets it, even if the son died before the father, and the son never received the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Reish Lakish (and unlike R. Yochanan)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If the son sold the property and then died in the father's lifetime, the buyer never gets it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The buyer gets it (after the father dies).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah says that if the son sold it, the buyer does not get it until the father dies. R. Yochanan explains that this is when the father died before the son, and the property passed to the son;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the son died before the father, the property never passed to the son, so the buyer never gets it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that Kinyan Peros (the father owns the yield as long as he is alive) is like Kinyan ha'Guf (owning the land itself), so the son sold something that he does not own.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>According to Reish Lakish, the Mishnah says that the buyer gets it when the father dies. This is even if the son died before the father, and the property never passed to the son.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that Kinyan Peros is not like Kinyan ha'Guf. The son was considered the owner when he sold it, so the sale stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>(Presumably,) both R. Yirmiyah bar Aba and Rav Yehudah hold like Reish Lakish (for the Halachah follows him)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>R. Yirmiyah bar Aba said that Kinyan Peros cannot be like Kinyan ha'Guf, for if it were, when the son died before the father, the buyer would not never get the property, for the son never owned it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rebuttal (Rav Yehudah):</span> Shmuel taught that the case (of the gift of Rav Shmuel's mother) is not like the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it different?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> Had the Mishnah said that Shimon wrote a document giving his property to his father after Shimon's death, we could indeed learn that Kinyan Peros is not like Kinyan ha'Guf;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, in the Mishnah Reuven gave his property to his son. (Perhaps) the son's sale stands because he can inherit his father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Also a father can inherit his son!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, one who gave his property to his father intended that his own children not inherit it. Likewise, one who gave his property to one son intended that his other children not inherit it! (The reason that the son's sale stands is not because he can inherit his father. He could inherit only part! Rather, we must say that Kinyan Peros is not like Kinyan ha'Guf.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The case of Rav Shmuel's mother is different due to the enactment of Usha.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> In Usha, they enacted that if a woman sells her Melug property and dies in her husband's lifetime, he takes the property from the buyer.</p>
