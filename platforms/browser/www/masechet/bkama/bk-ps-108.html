<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MULTIPLE FINES ON ONE PRINCIPAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> (A thief who pays Kefel does not add a Chomesh.) Does the principal for which one must pay Kefel exempt from the Chomesh, or does the oath exempt from Chomesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reuven (claimed and) swore that a deposit was stolen; he later swore that it was lost. Witnesses later testified that Reuven had the deposit when he took the first oath, and he admitted that he swore falsely the second time.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Does the principal for which he pays Kefel exempt from the Chomesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, perhaps only an oath that obligates Kefel exempts from the Chomesh. Since the second oath does not obligate Kefel, he adds a fifth for that oath!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If Levi accepted (answered 'Amen' to) an oath that he did not steal Yehudah's ox, and witnesses testified that he ate it, he pays Kefel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Levi admitted by himself, he pays principal and Chomesh and brings an Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here, the witnesses obligate him to pay Kefel, and he adds a Chomesh only if he admits by himself, but not after witnesses testify;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If only an oath that obligates Kefel exempts from the Chomesh, why is he exempt if he admits after witnesses came? Since his oath does not obligate Kefel, he should add a fifth!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Principal for which one pays Kefel exempts from Chomesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Can one man be liable to pay a Chomesh, and another man Kefel, on the same principal?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reuven gave his ox to Shimon and Levi to watch. They (claimed and) swore that it was stolen. Shimon admitted that he swore falsely, and witnesses testified that it was not stolen.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Was the Torah was insistent that one man not pay Kefel and an Chomesh (on one principal), but both may be paid (by different men)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, perhaps the Torah does not obligate Kefel and Chomesh on one principal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This question is unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Can one man be liable to pay two Chomeshim or two Kefelim on one principal?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1 (regarding two fifths):</span> Reuven swore that a deposit was lost, admitted that he swore falsely, and again swore that it was lost, and admitted that also this was false.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2 (regarding two Kefelim):</span> Reuven swore that a deposit was stolen, witnesses testified that he really stole it; he again swore that it was stolen, witnesses testified that he really stole it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Is the Torah concerned that a man not pay two types of monetary fines (Kefel and an Chomesh) on one principal, but he can pay the same type more than once?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, perhaps the Torah does not obligate more than one fine on one principal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can learn from Rava;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Va'Chamishisav (and its fifths) he will add" teaches that many Chomeshim can be added for one principal.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CAN A <i>SHOMER</i> RECEIVE <i>KEFEL</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Reuven claimed his deposit from Shimon, and Shimon swore that it was stolen, then he decided to pay for it (even though he is exempt) and the thief was found, who receives Kefel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Reuven gets it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Shimon gets it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye holds that Reuven gets it. Since Shimon did not pay immediately, Reuven does not give Shimon (ownership of the object in order that Shimon should acquire) Kefel (if the thief will be found).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava holds that Shimon gets it. Since Shimon paid in the end, Reuven gives him (ownership in order that Shimon should acquire) Kefel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>They argue about how to explain the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Levi deposited an animal or Kelim by Yehudah, a Shomer Chinam, and they were lost or stolen, Yehudah could have sworn to be exempt, but he paid and did not want to swear. If the thief is found, he pays Kefel (or four or five, if he slaughtered or sold an ox or Seh) to Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Yehudah swore and did not want to pay, and the thief is found, he pays Kefel (or four or five) to Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Abaye learns from the Reisha. It says that he paid and did not want to swear;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">108b----------------------------------------108b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he sworn, even if he paid later, the thief would pay Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rava learns from the Seifa. It says that he swore, and did not want to pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he paid, even though he swore, the thief would pay Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa is unlike Abaye!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It means that if he swore and did not want to pay before swearing, only after swearing, he pays Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha is unlike Rava!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It means that if he swore and did not want to rely on his oath, rather he paid, he pays Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN THE <i>SHOMER</i> CLAIMS FROM THE THIEF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Levi claimed his deposit from Yehudah. Yehudah swore, and it became known that Reuven had stolen it. Yehudah claimed from him, and Reuven admitted. Levi claimed from Reuven, and Reuven denied the theft. Witnesses testified that he stole it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Reuven exempt from Kefel because he admitted to Yehudah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If Yehudah swore truthfully (that it was stolen), Reuven is exempt (because Levi still trusts Yehudah, Yehudah was in Levi's place when he claimed the deposit, it is as if Reuven admitted to Levi);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Yehudah swore falsely (e.g. that it died), Reuven is liable (Levi no longer trusts Yehudah. Yehudah was not in Levi's place when he claimed the deposit, so it is not as if Reuven admitted to Levi.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If Yehudah was about to swear falsely, but Levi did not allow him, what is the law? (Is it as if he swore falsely, so Levi does not trust him any longer?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This question is unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Levi claimed the deposit from Yehudah, and Yehudah paid. It became known that Reuven had stolen it; Levi claimed from him, and Reuven admitted. Yehudah claimed from Reuven, and Reuven denied the theft. Witnesses testified that he stole it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Reuven exempt from Kefel because he admitted to Levi?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Can Yehudah tell Levi 'since I paid you, you have no further claim on the stolen object (so Reuven's admission to you is meaningless)'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, can Levi say 'just like you acted kindly to me (by paying), I should act kindly for you (to claim from Reuven to return your money, so it was a proper admission)'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This question is unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If a deposit was stolen through Ones (the Shomer was not negligent), and the thief was found:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Shomer was a Shomer Chinam, he may choose to claim the deposit from the thief, or to swear that it was stolen through Ones;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was a Shomer Sachar, he must claim the deposit from the thief. Swearing that it was stolen through Ones will not exempt him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Even a Shomer Chinam must claim the deposit from the thief.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rava argues with Rav Huna bar Avin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Avin):</span> If a deposit was stolen through Ones, and the thief was found, if the Shomer was a Shomer Chinam, he may choose to claim the deposit from the thief, or to swear that it was stolen through Ones;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was a Shomer Sachar, he must claim the deposit from the thief. Swearing that it was stolen through Ones will not exempt him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Rav Huna discusses a Shomer who already swore (but l'Chatchilah, he must claim from the thief).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He said that he may choose to claim the deposit from the thief, or to swear!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant that he may choose to rely on his oath, or to claim the deposit from the thief.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah Zuti):</span> If a deposit was stolen through Ones, and the thief returned it to the Shomer's house, and then it died through negligence, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once it was stolen through Ones, he is not longer a Shomer (even after it is returned, so he is exempt);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps when the thief returns it, he resumes being a Shomer (and he is liable)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>This question is unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>LIABILITY TO PAY PRINCIPAL AND <i>CHOMESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> If Reuven was watching a deposit, and he claimed that it was lost and accepted (answered Amen to) an oath to this effect, then witnesses testified that he ate it, he pays principal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he admitted that he ate it, he pays principal and Chomesh and brings a Korban Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he claimed that it was stolen and accepted an oath about this, then witnesses testified that he ate it, he pays Kefel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he admitted that he ate it, he pays principal and Chomesh and brings an Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven stole from his father, swore falsely to him, and his father died, he pays principal and Chomesh to his (Rashi - father's; Tosfos - own) children or brothers, and brings an Asham;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Really, since he is an heir (if he has no brothers, he is the only heir) of his father, some (or all) of the payments should revert to him. However, he must remove the entire theft (and Chomesh) from his Reshus.) If he does not want (or lacks the money) to pay the share he should inherit, he borrows this amount, and the creditors collect it from his share of the inheritance.</p>
