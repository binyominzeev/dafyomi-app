<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ARE SLAVES LIKE LAND?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula, after Rav Nachman left):</span> Really, R. Elazar said that we collect slaves even from orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Ula evaded me (he feared lest I challenge him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Cases occurred in which the judges of Nehardai collected slaves from orphans, and R. Chana bar Bizna did so in Pumbedisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman (to the creditor):</span> Return the slaves. If not, I will collect from your house!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> R. Elazar, Ula, the judges of Nehardai and R. Chana bar Bizna all say that we collect. On whom do you rely to oppose this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> I rely on a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Avimi - Beraisa):</span> Pruzbul (a document handing over loans to Beis Din, so they will not be cancelled in Shemitah) takes effect on (is valid only if the lender has) land. It does not take effect on slaves;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Metaltelim (movable objects) can be acquired Agav (along with an acquisition of) land, but not with an acquisition of slaves.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ACQUISITION <i>AGAV</i> LAND AND SLAVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not slaves are like land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> Shimon was buying slaves and land. If he did a Chazakah to acquire the slaves, he did not acquire the land. If he did a Chazakah to acquire the land, he does not acquire the slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he was buying land and Metaltelim, if he did a Chazakah to acquire the land, he did acquired the Metaltelim. If he made a Kinyan on the Metaltelim, he did not acquire the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he was buying slaves and Metaltelim, if he did a Chazakah to acquire the slaves, he did not acquire the Metaltelim. If he made a Kinyan on the Metaltelim, he did not acquire the slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If he did a Chazakah to acquire the slaves, he acquires the Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana #1 (of Beraisa #1) holds that slaves are like Metaltelim. Tana #2 holds that they are like land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rejection (Rav Ika brei d'Rav Ami):</span> All agree that slaves are like land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana holds that Metaltelim are acquired only with land like "fortified cities in Yehudah" (the source for acquisition Agav land), i.e. stationary land.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Property without Achrayus (a lender cannot collect it from one who bought the property from the borrower, i.e. Metaltelim) is acquired with property with Achrayus (land), through money, a document or Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Chizkiyah):</span> "He gave them... gold, silver and choice gifts with fortified cities in Yehudah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rejection (Rav Ika brei d'Rav Ami):</span> All agree that slaves are like Metaltelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tana #2 said that Metaltelim are acquired with slaves. He refers to the clothes that the slave is wearing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it help if he is wearing them? A slave is like a moving Chatzer (yard), which does not acquire Metaltelim inside it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Beraisa discusses when the slave is standing still.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rava taught that anything that does not acquire when it moves, does not acquire when it stands still.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the slave is tied up (he cannot move), what he is wearing is acquired with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #3):</span> A Chazakah to acquire the land also acquires the slaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when the slaves are standing in the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> If so, Beraisa #1 says that they are not acquired even when standing in the land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Version #1, that slaves are like Metaltelim. Metaltelim are acquired with land only if they are on that land'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Version #2, slaves are like land. What difference does it make whether or not they are in the land?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If Reuven was buying lands in different places, he makes a Chazakah on one and acquires them all.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to Version #1, slaves are like Metaltelim. What difference does it make whether or not they are in the land? We hold that Metaltelim are acquired with land even if they are not on that land!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that Metaltelim that move are unlike Metaltelim that do not move.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can likewise say that land that moves is unlike land that does not move!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Slaves are land that moves. Shmuel discusses (regular) land. All land is connected.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OWNERSHIP OF <i>KODSHIM</i> <i>KALIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Property to which Me'ilah does not apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> Me'ilah does not apply to them, but they are Kodshim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The Mishnah discusses Kodshei Kalim. It is like R. Yosi ha'Glili, who says that they are the property of their owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He transgressed in Hash-m (and denied his fellowman)" includes Kodshei Kalim, which (pertain to Hash-m and) are (also) a person's property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Mekadesh with his portion of Kodshim, whether Kodshei Kodoshim or Kodshei Kalim, the Kidushin is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This Mishnah is unlike R. Yosi ha'Glili!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It can even be like R. Yosi ha'Glili. He said that Kodshei Kalim are the property of the owners only in the life of the animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After slaughter, he agrees that they are considered Hash-m's, just we are allowed to eat them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yosi ha'Glili really hold that Kodshei Kalim are the property of the owners in the life of the animal?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An unblemished Bechor (male firstborn animal) may be sold when alive. If it is blemished, it may be sold alive or slaughtered; he (the Kohen) may use it to be Mekadesh a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> This is only nowadays. Since it cannot be offered, Kohanim own it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When the Mikdash stands, Kohanim do not own it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> "He transgressed in Hash-m" includes Kodshei Kalim, which are a person's property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The Beraisa discusses a Bechor in Chutz la'Aretz, according to R. Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He holds that if they were brought to the Mikdash unblemished, they are offered. L'Chatchilah, we do not bring them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> If R. Yosi ha'Glili says that they are a person's money while they are alive, Ravina should rather have answered that the Beraisa is like R. Yosi ha'Glili!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Gifts to the Kohen are unlike other Kodshei Kalim. They are Hash-m's (just the Kohen is allowed to eat them).</p>
