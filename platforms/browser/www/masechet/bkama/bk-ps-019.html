<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 18-20 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the ninth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SPECIAL CASES OF <i>TZEROROS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. They argue the first time it happens, like Sumchus and Chachamim argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is abnormal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There were seeds in the Kli (so it is normal to stick its head in and cackle).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Does an abnormal case of Tzeroros pay half-damage or quarter damage?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can settle the question from Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Can Tzeroros become Mu'ad (to pay full damage)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If abnormal Tzeroros pay only quarter-damage, surely they would not become Mu'ad to pay full damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Rava himself was unsure whether abnormality applies to Tzeroros;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He asked, if abnormality does not apply to Tzeroros, can Tzeroros become Mu'ad?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Ashi's question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Does Sumchus consider impetus of impetus like impetus (the damager set something in motion, it set something else in motion which then damaged), or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he learn a tradition from Sinai (of half- damage), and apply this to impetus of impetus?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does he have no tradition (of half-damage of impetus) at all?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW TO READ THE MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it was kicking, or pebbles were being strewn by its feet and Kelim were broken, it pays half- damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we read the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does it say 'if it kicked and damaged, or if it strewed up pebbles (while walking normally) and damaged, it pays half-damage?'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If so, it is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, if it kicked and damaged, or if it (abnormally) kicked pebbles and damaged, it pays half-damage?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If so, it is like Sumchus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reisha):</span> If it trampled on a Kli and broke it, and (fragments) broke another Kli, it pays full damage for the first Kli, and half-damage for the second.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is unlike Sumchus. He holds that Tzeroros pay full damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah means that he pays full damage for the 'first Kli' broken by shards of the trampled Kli, and half-damage for the 'second Kli' (the one broken by shards of the 'first Kli')!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We must say that Sumchus differentiates between impetus and impetus of impetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Ashi never resolved whether Sumchus differentiates between impetus and impetus of impetus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Ashi established the Mishnah like Chachamim. His question (1:a, about abnormal Tzeroros), was based on how to read the Mishnah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does it say 'if it kicked and damaged, or if it strewed up pebbles (normally) and damaged, it pays half-damage?'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had it abnormally kicked pebbles and damaged, it would pay quarter damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does it say 'if it kicked and damaged, or if it (abnormally) kicked pebbles and damaged, it pays half-damage?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHERE ARE <i>TZEROROS</i> LIABLE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> If an animal was walking in a place where it must strew up pebbles, and it kicked pebbles and damaged, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since it had to strew up pebbles, this is normal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since it kicked, it is abnormal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> If an animal was walking in a Reshus ha'Rabim and strewed up pebbles and damaged, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we compare it to Keren, and it is liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since Tzeroros are a Toldah of Regel, it is exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Presumably, since Tzeroros are a Toldah of Regel, it is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> If it strewed up pebbles in a Reshus ha'Rabim and damaged in a Reshus ha'Yachid (private domain) what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Since he is exempt at the place where it strewed them up, he is not liable for where they land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah - Beraisa):</span> It was walking and strewed up pebbles, whether in a Reshus ha'Rabim or a Reshus ha'Yachid, it is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It strewed up in a Reshus ha'Rabim, and damaged in the Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> No, it strewed up in a Reshus ha'Rabim, and damaged in a Reshus ha'Yachid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmiyah:</span> You said that also that is exempt!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah - Mishnah):</span> If it trampled on a Kli and broke it, and (fragments) broke another Kli, it pays full damage for the first Kli, and half-damage for the second.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This is only in the victim's premises. In a Reshus ha'Rabim, he is exempt for the first Kli, and liable for the last.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It strewed up in a Reshus ha'Rabim, and damaged in the Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> No, it strewed up in a Reshus ha'Rabim, and damaged in a Reshus ha'Yachid.</p>

<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that there is no distinction in half-damage between Reshus ha'Rabim and Reshus ha'Yachid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means, (he is liable even if) it strewed up in a Reshus ha'Rabim, and damaged in the Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> No, it strewed up in a Reshus ha'Rabim, and damaged in a Reshus ha'Yachid.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DAMAGE THROUGH WAGGING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehudah Nesi'ah or R. Oshiya):</span> If an animal damaged by wagging its tail, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (the other of R. Yehudah and R. Oshiya):</span> You can't expect a man to hold his animal's tail as he walks! (He is exempt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> You can't expect a man to hold his animal's horns as he walks, yet he is liable for Keren!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is different. Keren is abnormal, but wagging its tail is normal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If it is normal, clearly it is like Regel (and exempt in a Reshus ha'Rabim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asked about excessive wagging.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Eina):</span> If it damaged by wagging the Ever (male organ), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is just like goring. Its evil inclination overcame it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, it is unlike goring, in which it intends to damage. Here, it does not intend to damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>MOVING OBSTACLES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chickens are Mu'ad to walk normally and break... (if something was tied to its leg, or if it was dancing and broke Kelim, it pays half-damage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This is only if it became tied by itself. If a man tied it, he pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it became tied by itself, who pays?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The owner of the tied item pays.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the item was hidden away, he is blameless!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it was not hidden away, he was negligent! (He should pay full damage, like for a pit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the owner of the chicken pays.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, he doesn't pay full damage because it says "when a man will open a pit", not when an ox will open a pit (create an obstacle);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If so, he should be totally exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Mishnah (that obligates half- damage) discusses a chicken that damaged by throwing the attached item (Tzeroros). Rav Huna's law was not taught regarding our Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If a Hefker item became attached to a chicken and damaged, the chicken's owner is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is only if it became tied by itself. If a man tied it, the man pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For which (Av or Toldah) damager is he liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna bar Mano'ach):</span> This is a pit that is pushed around by people and animals.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>SHEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shen is Mu'ad to eat what is appropriate for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>An animal is Mu'ad to eat fruit and vegetables. If it ate clothing or Kelim, it pays half-damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This is in the victim's premises. In Reshus ha'Rabim, it is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If it benefited, it pays the benefit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is when it ate from Rechavah (a public area or square). If it ate from the side of the Rechavah, it pays the damage (Rashi - according to the damage, but it only pays half-damage, like Keren. Most explain that it pays full damage.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it ate from the entrance to a store, it pays what it benefited;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it ate from inside the store, it pays (Rashi - half) the damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Shen is Mu'ad to eat what is fitting for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If it entered the victim's premises and ate fitting food and drink, it pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Similarly, if a Chayah entered the victim's premises and killed an animal and ate meat, it pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If a cow ate barley, a donkey ate fodder, a dog lapped up oil, or a pig that ate a piece of meat, it pays full damage (even though these are not their normal foods).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Since we say that anything not normally eaten, but is eaten in pressed circumstances, is considered eating, if a cat ate dates, or a donkey ate fish, it pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A case occurred in which a donkey ate bread and chewed the basket. Rav Yehudah obligated the owner to pay full damage for the bread and half-damage for the basket.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since it is normal for a donkey to eat bread, it is also normal to chew the basket at the time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After eating the bread, it chewed the basket.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really normal for a donkey to eat bread?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If it ate bread, meat or a cooked dish it pays half-damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to a Behemah (which includes a donkey).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, it refers to a Chayah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is normal for a Chayah to eat meat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The meat was roasted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Beraisa discusses a deer (it does not normally eat meat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (l)):</span> The Beraisa discusses a Behemah. It ate on a table.</p>
