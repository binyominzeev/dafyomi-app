<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 36-37 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the ninth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>COLLECTION FROM TWO OXEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two oxen of Reuven... they are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Inference - Rava of Parzika):</span> When (we do not know which of) two Tamim oxen damaged, the victim may collect from either.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> No. The case is, both are Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Seifa):</span> Levi says, the big ox damaged the big ox...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they are Mu'ad, it doesn't matter which damaged which! (In any case he pays full damage.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Reisha discusses Mu'adim, and the Seifa discusses Tamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (R. Acha Sava):</span> If they are Mu'adim, why does the Mishnah say 'they are liable'? It should say that Reuven is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (R. Acha):</span> Why does it say that both of them are liable? (Even one pays full damage!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, they are Tamim. The Mishnah is like R. Akiva, who says that the victim is a partner in the damager;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Both are liable' means that when both animals are here, Reuven pays. If one was lost, he would be exempt. He could say that perhaps the lost animal damaged.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MULTIPLE GORINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven's ox gored four or five oxen, of (Shimon,) Levi, Yehudah, Gad and Asher, he pays the damage to Asher's ox, up to the value of Reuven's ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there is money left over (Reuven's ox is worth more than the damage), he uses it to pay Gad (and if there remains, Yehudah, Levi, and Shimon). The last victim always collects first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon says, if David's ox gored Moshe's ox, and both were worth 200, and the carcass is worthless, David and Moshe each end up with 100.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the ox then gored Kalev's ox, Kalev gets 100, and David and Moshe each end up with 50.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it then gored Aharon's ox, Aharon gets 100, Kalev gets 50, David and Moshe each end up with a gold Dinar (25 silver Dinarim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (R. Meir in) our Mishnah is not like R. Yishmael, nor like R. Akiva!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Yishmael, the victims are creditors (not partners in the damager). The first victim should collect first, not the last!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to R. Akiva, the victims are partners in the damager. Extra money should be split equally. The last victim should not collect first!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Really, it is like R. Yishmael. The latter victim collects first, because we discuss when each victim seized the ox to collect from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is like a Shomer Sachar, who is responsible for damage that the animal does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does extra money go to the last victim? It should go to the owner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The Mishnah teaches that if a victim owns more of the animal than it damaged the next time, he keeps the excess.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Also Ravin explained that the Mishnah discusses when the victims did not guard the damager.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa is unlike R. Yishmael!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Shimon):</span> If David's ox worth 200 gored Moshe's ox worth 200, and the carcass is worthless, David and Moshe each end up with 100.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the ox then gored Kalev's ox, Kalev gets 100, and David and Moshe each end up with 50.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the ox then gored Aharon's ox, Aharon gets 100, Kalev gets 50, and David and Moshe each end up with 25.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This is like R. Akiva, who says that the victim is a partner! Can the Reisha be like R. Yishmael, and the Seifa like R. Akiva?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE PAYMENT FOR <i>TOKE'A</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Toke'a a man (hit him near the ear; others explain, blew a Shofar in his ear), he pays one Sela;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, he pays 100 (silver) Dinarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A case occurred in which Ploni was Toke'a Shimon. Rav Tuvya bar Masnah asked Rav Yosef if the Mishnah means a Sela Tzuri (pure silver) or a common Sela (worth an eighth as much, for it is seven eighths copper).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> We learn from our Mishnah. The first two each end up with a gold Dinar (25 silver Dinarim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Sela'im (of the Mishnah) are common Sela'im, the Mishnah should have discussed another goring. The first two would get 12 (silver) Dinarim and (half a Dinar, which is) a Sela! (Rather, Sela'im are Tzuri, four Dinarim; the Tana did not want to discuss fractions.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Tana would not lengthen the Mishnah unless this teaches something new!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the final ruling?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learned from Rav Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> All money mentioned in the Torah is Tzuri. All money of enactments mid'Rabanan (such as Toke'a) is common money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>When Shimon heard that he will only receive a half- Dinar, he was not interested. He said 'give it to the poor'. He later retracted and asked to get it.</p>
