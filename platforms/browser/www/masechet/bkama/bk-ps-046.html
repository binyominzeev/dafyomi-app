<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>MU'AD</i> CANNOT BE GUARDED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> A Mu'ad cannot be guarded. It must be killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> What is R. Elazar's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> He learns from "and he will not guard it" (after becoming Mu'ad), it cannot be guarded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, he should also expound "and he will not cover (a pit)" - it can no longer be covered!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps indeed, this is true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> If he covered a pit properly and an animal fell in and died, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> R. Elazar holds like R. Nasan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> "Do not put blood in your house" forbids raising a wild dog or erecting a rickety ladder in one's house.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A DOUBT ABOUT HOW MUCH TO PAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an ox gored a cow, and a dead calf is near the cow, and we do not know if the calf was born before the goring (and died by itself), or after the goring (and died due to the goring), the ox pays half- damage for the cow, and quarter-damage for the calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Similarly, if a cow gored an ox, and a calf is near the cow, and we do not know if the calf was born before or after the goring, we collect half-damage for the ox from the cow, and quarter-damage from the calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> Our Mishnah is like Sumchus, who says that when in doubt, we split the money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim argue and say, the great general rule in monetary matters is ha'Motzi me'Chaveiro Alav ha'Re'ayah (the one who wants to collect must bring proof).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must they say 'this is a great general rule in monetary matters'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This includes even when the victim makes a definite claim, and the damager is unsure.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This teaches like Shmuel taught (below).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Reuven sold an ox to Shimon, and it was found to be a gorer, the sale is mistaken (and therefore void).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Reuven can say, I sold it to you to slaughter (the sale is valid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let us see whether Shimon buys oxen for plowing or for slaughter!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he buys for both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let us see if he paid the price of a plowing ox or an ox for slaughter!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the price is the same for both.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Reuven has nothing else to give Shimon in place of the money he owes, he may give him the ox!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Reuven has other money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav says that the sale is mistaken. We follow the majority. Most people buy oxen for plowing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel says, he can say 'I sold it to you to slaughter.' We follow the majority only in Isurim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In monetary matters, ha'Motzi me'Chaveiro Alav ha'Re'ayah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yehudah - Beraisa - Sumchus):</span> If an ox gored a cow, and a dead calf is near the cow, and we do not know if the calf was born before or after the goring. The ox pays half-damage for the cow, and quarter-damage for the calf;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, ha'Motzi me'Chaveiro Alav ha'Re'ayah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Chachamim learn this principal from "whoever has a claim Yigash (will approach) them (Aharon and Chur)" - we read this, Yagish (he will bring (proof)) to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> Why must we learn from a verse? Logic dictates this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the verse teaches like Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> We first listen to the one who claims that he should collect (and he collects before we hear the other party's claim) - "whoever has a claim Yigash to them" - Yagish (he will bring his claim (first)).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Neharda'a):</span> Sometimes we listen to the defendant's claim first, e.g. if his property is declining in value.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>SAFEK</i> ABOUT WHETHER THE FETUS HELPED DAMAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if Reuven's cow gored Shimon's ox...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he pay half-damage (from the cow) and quarter-damage (from the calf)? He owes only half- damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> When the Mishnah says half-damage, it refers to half of what he must pay, i.e. quarter- damage. When the Mishnah says quarter-damage, it means, eighth-damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If Reuven owns also the calf, he must pay half-damage no matter when the calf was born. The case is, Levi owns the calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> If Shimon first demanded payment from Reuven, Shimon can say, your cow damaged my ox. You (alone) owe me half-damage, unless you can prove that the calf (was already born and) was a partner in the damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, Shimon first demanded payment from Levi. (A Vadai partner in the damage would pay half of half-damage, i.e. quarter damage. Shimon gets only an eighth because we are unsure whether the calf was a partner.) Now Reuven can say 'you showed that you believe that there was a partner in the damage, so I need pay only half the half-damage.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Even if Shimon first demanded payment from Reuven, Reuven can say, I believe that there was a partner in the damage. I will pay only half the half- damage, unless you bring proof otherwise. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> The Mishnah does not say quarter- damage and eighth-damage. It says half-damage and quarter-damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Really, Reuven owns also the calf. The Mishnah means that if the cow is here, the full half- damage is collected from the cow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the cow is not here, quarter-damage is collected from the calf.</p>
