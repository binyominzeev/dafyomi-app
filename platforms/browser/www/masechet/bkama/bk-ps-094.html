<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CHANGING AN OBJECT (<i>SHINUY</i>) DOES NOT ACQUIRE IT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Beis Shamai forbid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse (forbidding a Korban that was a harlot's wages or was traded for a dog) says "also", to include what they are transformed into.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Hillel explain, they are forbidden, but what they are transformed into is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Beis Shamai explain, they are forbidden, but their offspring are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Beis Hillel say that both are excluded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Beis Hillel learn from "also"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>(Abaye taught that also R. Eliezer ben Yakov, R. Shimon ben Elazar, and R. Yishmael hold that Ein Shinuy Koneh. The coming three Beraisos show this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> If Reuven stole wheat, ground it, kneaded and baked it and separated Chalah from it, his Berachah only angers Hash-m;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"A thief who blesses, blasphemes."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> The general rule is, whatever improvement a thief made on a stolen object, he has the upper hand. He may keep the improvement, or say 'here is your object.'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> If he improved it, he receives the added value; if he decreased its value, he returns the object and says 'here is your object', since he did not acquire it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, when he improved it, why does he receive the added value?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is an enactment to facilitate repentance of thieves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Pe'ah should be designated and not harvested. If it was harvested, one separates (the amount that should have been left) from the sheaves (and gives it to the poor). If he did not do so, he separates from the stack before Miru'ach (final processing);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Miru'ach was already done, he separates the proper amount, takes Ma'asros on it, and gives it to the poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yishmael says, even if he made a dough, he separates from the dough and give to the poor (he still did not acquire it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rav Papa):</span> Do all these Tana'im hold like Beis Shamai?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> No, they say that Beis Hillel agree that Ein Shinuy Koneh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rava):</span> We need not say that they hold that Ein Shinuy Koneh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps R. Shimon ben Yehudah says only that dying does not acquire because it can be removed through soap!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Perhaps Beis Shamai say that Ein Shinuy Koneh only regarding a Korban, because it is despised (since it was once a harlot's wages)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Perhaps R. Eliezer ben Yakov says that Ein Shinuy Koneh only regarding Berachah, because the Mitzvah came through a sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Perhaps R. Shimon ben Elazar says only that a reversible Shinuy does not acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Perhaps R. Yishmael says that Ein Shinuy Koneh only regarding Pe'ah, because the verse says an extra "leave" (for the poor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yishmael should learn from Pe'ah to elsewhere that Ein Shinuy Koneh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from gifts to the poor, like R. Yonasan taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (R. Yonasan):</span> What is R. Yishmael's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Does he hold that normally, Ein Shinuy Koneh?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, perhaps he normally holds that Shinuy Koneh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If he normally holds that Ein Shinuy Koneh, why does the verse repeat "leave"? How do Chachamim expound this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If one declared his vineyard Hefker and harvests it, he must leave Peret (grapes that fall during harvesting), Olelos (deficient clusters), Shichechah (what was forgotten in the vineyard) and Pe'ah for the poor, but he is exempt from Ma'asros.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW WE RULE WITH REGARD TO <i>SHINUY</i> <i>KONEH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R.</span>Shimon ben Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere, Shmuel taught differently!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We do not make an evaluation (of an animal that died) for thieves or Gazlanim (because they acquire the carcass), only for damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (for Rava):</span> R. Shimon ben Elazar said only that a reversible Shinuy does not acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, Abaye says that R. Shimon ben Elazar holds that even an irreversible Shinuy does not acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (for Abaye):</span> Shmuel said that some rule like R. Shimon ben Elazar, but he himself does not.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">94b----------------------------------------94b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> Mid'Oraisa, one who changes a stolen object must return it - "he will return the stolen object that he stole", even if it changed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah says that he acquires it. This is an enactment to facilitate repentance of thieves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Yochanan really say that?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows an anonymous Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he dyed the shearings before giving them to a Kohen, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yakov):</span> R. Yochanan holds that our Mishnah discusses stealing smooth wood, so making Kelim is a reversible change. (This acquires only mid'Rabanan. An irreversible Shinuy acquires mid'Oraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE ENACTMENT TO FACILITATE REPENTANCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If thieves or people who collected Ribis want to return what they took, we do not accept from them. Chachamim are unhappy with one who accepts from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This was taught in Rebbi's time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which a thief wanted to repent. His wife dissuaded him, for then he would need to return even his belt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It was then enacted not to accept from thieves or people who collected Ribis who want to return what they took.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a man died, and left to his orphans money that he collected for Ribis, even if they know this, they need not return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They need not return it, but their father would need to return it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, even their father is exempt. The Beraisa discusses them for parallel structure to the Seifa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If their father left them a cow, garment or any specific item, they must return it due to the honor of their father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should they need to return it for the honor of their father?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Do not curse a Nasi of your nation" refers to one who acts like your nation (but we are not concerned for honor of the wicked)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can answer like Rav Pinchas answered (elsewhere). The case is, the father repented.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he repented, he should have returned it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He died before he was able to.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Thieves or people who lent on Ribis, even if they collected, they return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The expression 'collected' does not apply to thieves!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> The Beraisa means, thieves, i.e. people who lent on Ribis, even if they collected, they return.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They return, but the borrowers do not accept.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Beraisa tell them to return it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Through offering to return it, they fulfill their obligation b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> It is difficult for shepherds (they graze their animals in others' fields) and tax collectors (who take more than they should) to repent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They must return to the people from whom they know that they stole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They return, but (the ones they stole from) do not accept.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Beraisa tell them to return it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Through offering, they fulfill their obligation b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If so, why is it hard for them to repent?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Seifa of Beraisa):</span> To atone for those that they do not know, they pay for public needs;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> They build pits to store water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This Beraisa was before the enactment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> We can even say that the Beraisa is after the enactment. Rav Nachman taught that if they still have the stolen object, they must return it.</p>
