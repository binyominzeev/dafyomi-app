<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DAMAGE IN THE PREMISES OF A THIRD PARTY (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should Levi's liability depend on whether or not Shimon had permission?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Shimon had permission, it is as if the damage was in the victim's premises, where Shen is liable. If he had no permission, it is like Shen in a Reshus ha'Rabim, which is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 5:a, 47b - Beraisa):</span> If Shimon brought his ox into Reuven's yard without permission and Levi's ox damaged it, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon had permission to bring them in, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is exempt or liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Reuven is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, Levi is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should Levi's liability depend on whether Shimon had permission or not?! (Here we discuss Keren, which is liable even in Reshus ha'Rabim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Tarfon, who says that Keren in the victim's premises pays full damage. If Shimon had permission, it is as if the damage to be in the victim's premises; without permission, it is like Keren in a Reshus ha'Rabim, which pays half-damage. ('Exempt' in the Beraisa means 'from paying full damage.')</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>RESPONSIBILITY TO GUARD THE HOST'S ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A case occurred in which a woman came to Reuven's house to bake. Reuven's goat ate her dough, got sick and died. Rava obligated her to pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rava argues with Rav (who says that the animal should not have eaten).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Rav discusses one who enters without permission. He does not accept responsibility to guard (his host's animals) from being damaged;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, she entered with permission. She accepted to guard Reuven's animals from damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than the woman who entered Reuven's premises, without permission, to grind wheat?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven's animal ate her wheat, he is exempt. If his animal was damaged, she is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> Had she entered with permission, she would be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Grinding does not require privacy, so Reuven is responsible to guard his animals from eating her wheat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Baking requires privacy (her arms become exposed), so Reuven cannot be there. She is responsible to guard his animals.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ENTERING WITHOUT PERMISSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon brought his ox into Reuven's yard...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Shimon brought his ox into Reuven's yard without permission, and it dug pits in the yard, Shimon pays for damage to the yard, Reuven is liable for things that fall in the pit (if he makes his yard Hefker).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though one is liable "when a man will dig a pit", and not when an ox will dig a pit, here, Reuven is liable because he should have filled them in;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since he did not fill them in, it is as if he dug them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Shimon brought his ox into Reuven's yard without permission, and it damaged Reuven, or Reuven was damaged on it, Shimon is liable. If it Ravatz (crouched), he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does crouching exempt Shimon?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Ravatz means that it Hirbitz Gelalim (excreted), and Reuven's clothing was dirtied.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The excrement is like a pit. A pit is exempt for Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Shmuel, who says that all obstacles are like a pit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav says that they are like a pit only if he makes them Hefker. If not, they are as his ox. An ox is liable for Kelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We assume that people make excrement Hefker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Shimon entered Reuven's yard without permission and he damaged Reuven, or Reuven was damaged through him, Shimon is liable. If Reuven damaged him, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is only if Reuven did not know that Shimon was there. If he knew, Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Granted, Reuven may tell Shimon to leave, but he may not damage him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This is like Rava or Rav Papa said elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava or Rav Papa):</span> If two people were both acting in a permitted way or both in a forbidden way and (actively) damaged each other, they are liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they got hurt through each other, they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> This is because they were both the same. If only one had permission, he is exempt and the other is liable.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FALLING IN A PIT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the ox fell into Reuven's pit and dirtied the water...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is only when it dirtied the water when it fell. If it dirtied it after it fell, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After falling, the ox is (a stationary damager) like a pit, and the water is like Kelim. A pit is exempt for Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Shmuel, who says that all obstacles are like a pit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav says that they are like a pit only if he makes them Hefker. If not, they are like his ox. Oxen are liable for Kelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> This is only when its body dirtied the water. If it died in the pit and the rotting carcass imparted a bad smell to the water, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is mere Gerama (causing damage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If his father or son was inside, he pays Kofer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he pay Kofer? The ox is Tam (to kill this way)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The case it, it is Mu'ad to fall on people in pits.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should have been stoned already!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It saw food in the pit (i.e. it did not intend to kill).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Yosi ha'Glili, who says that a Tam pays half-Kofer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> R. Yosi ha'Glili holds like R. Tarfon, who says that Keren pays full damage in the victim's premises. Likewise, it pays full Kofer in the victim's premises.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Ula, we understand why the Mishnah discusses the father or son (so that it was the victim's premises).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Shmuel, why did it specify the father or son?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It gave a typical case.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>ACCEPTANCE OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he entered with permission...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Halachah follows the first Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Shimon told Reuven 'bring in your ox and guard it', and if it damaged, Reuven is liable. If it was damaged, Shimon is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'bring in your ox and I will guard it', if it was damaged, Shimon is liable. If it damaged, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> In the Reisha, only because he said 'guard it', Reuven is liable (if it damages) and Shimon is exempt (if it was damaged). Had he omitted this, Reuven would be exempt, and Shimon would be liable, for he accepts responsibility;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa implies that only because he said 'I will guard it', Shimon is liable (if it is damaged) and Reuven is exempt (if it damages). Had he omitted this, Reuven would be liable, and Shimon would be exempt, for he does not accept responsibility. This is like Rebbi!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is the Reisha as Chachamim, and the end as Rebbi?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The entire Beraisa is like Chachamim. The inference from the Reisha is correct;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Seifa, the law is the same even if he did not accept to guard it. For parallel structure, it says that he accepted to guard it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> The entire Beraisa is like Rebbi. He holds like R. Tarfon, who says that Keren pays full damage in the victim's premises. (The Seifa is only when he accepts to guard it. The inference from the Reisha is as follows.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he told him to guard it, he does not give him jurisdiction over the area. If Reuven's ox damages Shimon's property, it is like Keren in the victim's premises, it pays full damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he did not tell him to guard it, he gives him jurisdiction over the area, so it is like Keren in a jointly owned domain. It pays half-damage.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>WHO PAYS FOR A FETUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an ox intended to gore an ox, and hit a woman and made her miscarry, it does not pay for the fetus;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven intended to kill a man, and he hit a woman and made her miscarry, he pays for the fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>To pay for the fetus, we evaluate how much the mother was worth before giving birth and after giving birth;</p>
