<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chochmas Yevanis is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> In Eretz Yisrael, one may not speak Sursi, rather Hebrew or Yevanis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> In Bavel, one may not speak Arami, rather Hebrew or Persian.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The language Yevanis is permitted. Chochmas Yevanis is different; it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chochmas Yevanis is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> "My eye wails, from all the daughters of my city" - of 1000 children in my father's house, 500 learned Torah, and 500 learned Chochmas Yevanis, and only me and my cousin survived.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Gamliel's house was close to the king, so they were permitted. Otherwise, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who cuts his hair Kumi (also called Beloris, i.e. he cuts the front and lets it grow in back) transgresses the Isur of going in the ways of the Emori;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Avtulmus bar Reuven was permitted to do this, because he was close to the king.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Since R. Gamliel's house was close to the king, they were permitted to speak Chochmas Yevanis.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>RAISING DOGS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not raise a dog unless it is tied on a chain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not raise a dog unless it is tied on a chain. One may raise a dog in a city near the border. He ties it during the day, and unties it at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ha'Gadol):</span> Raising dogs is like raising pigs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must he make this comparison? (He could simply say that it is forbidden!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that he is cursed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef bar Minyomi):</span> Bavel has the law of a city near the border.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He refers to Neharda'a.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Dostai of Biri):</span> "Shuvah Hash-m Rivevos (10,000's) Alfei (thousands) Yisrael" teaches that the Divine Presence does not rest on less than 22,000 Yisraelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there were one less than this amount, and a woman was pregnant, about to complete the number, and she miscarried due to a dog's bark, this would cause the Divine Presence to depart from Yisrael!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>A case occurred in which a pregnant woman (Leah) went to bake in another's house. A dog in the house barked at her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">The owner:</span> Don't worry. Its teeth were removed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Leah:</span> The fetus already died.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BIRD TRAPS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not spread traps for doves... within four Mil of a settled area (lest they eat from others).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They do not go so far!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Dovecotes must be at least 50 Amos from the city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> They eat their fill within 50 Amos, but they can fly up to four Mil (from their nest).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They can go further than four Mil!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not set dove traps even 100 Mil from a settled area.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> That is when the area in between is settled with vineyards.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> That is when the area in between is settled with dovecotes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should be forbidden to set traps due to the dovecotes!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answers:</span> The intermediate dovecotes are owned by Nochrim, or are Hefker, or belong to the one setting the traps.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE FIVE PAYMENTS FOR DAMAGES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven damaged Shimon, he is liable for five categories of payment: Nezek, pain, Refu'ah (medical expenses), Sheves (compensation for loss of wages until he can work again), and embarrassment.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Nezek:</span> If he blinded his eye, cut off his hand or broke his leg, we evaluate the loss of Shimon's value (if he would be sold to be a slave).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Pain:</span> If he burned him with a spit or nail, even on his fingernail (so no wound will result), we evaluate how much a person of Shimon's nature would ask to receive on condition that he will be pained this way.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Refu'ah:</span> If he hit him, he is obligated to heal him;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If sores developed, Reuven is liable only if they are due to the blow.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If [the wound seemingly] healed and returned, healed and returned, he is obligated;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>If it fully healed, he is not obligated to heal him [any more].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Sheves:</span> We consider what Shimon would earn guarding gourds, for Nezek already compensates for not being able to hold a high-paying job that requires use of his arm or leg.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Embarrassment:</span> We evaluate this according to the one who embarrassed and the one who was embarrassed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>HOW WE KNOW THAT MONEY IS TO BE PAID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does Reuven pay money? The Torah says "an eye in place of an eye." He should lose his eye!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If Reuven blinded Shimon's eye, cut off his hand, or broke his leg, the same should be done to Reuven!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "one who strikes a man" and "one who strikes an animal." Just like one who strikes an animal pays money, also one who strikes a man.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If you prefer, it says "do not take ransom for the soul of a murderer, who is a Rasha and should die" - we do not take ransom for a murderer, but we take ransom for extremal limbs that do not grow back.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which verse "one who strikes a man" does the Beraisa cite?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It cites "one who strikes an animal will pay, and one who strikes a man will die."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That discusses killing!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it cites "one who strikes the soul of an animal will pay for it, a soul for a soul; a man who will put a blemish in his fellow man, as he did, so will be done to him."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This verse does not say 'strike' (as it says in the Beraisa)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa learns the concept of striking from animals to people.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like one who strikes an animal pays, also one who strikes a man.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "one who strikes any soul of a man will die"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That means that he will pay.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it literally means that he is killed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> The Torah equates this to "one who strikes an animal will pay for it" (the previous verse).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> The next verse says "like (a man) will put a blemish in a man, so will be given to him." This refers to money.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say 'if you prefer'? (Why would one object to the previous answer?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana asked as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why learn (the law of a man who wounds a man) from damage to an animal? We should learn from a man who kills a man!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is preferable to learn damages from damages, and not from murder.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To the contrary, it is preferable to learn (striking a) man from man, and not from (striking an) animal!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>That is why the Tana wanted another answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If you prefer, it says "do not take ransom for the soul of a murderer, who is evil and should die; he will die" - we do not take ransom for a murderer, but we take ransom for extremal limbs that do not grow back.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We expound a different law from this verse, that we do not kill the murderer and make him pay!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn that from "according to his evilness" - we give only one punishment for his evilness, not two.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need "do not take ransom" to teach that he may not pay to exempt himself from death!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah could have taught that by saying "do not take ransom for one who is evil and should die"; "the soul of a murderer" is extra, to teach that we do not take ransom for a murderer, but we take ransom for limbs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we have this verse, why do we need the two verses equating one who strikes an animal and one who strikes a man?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Without that verse, one might have thought that the damager can choose to pay with money or his limb;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The verse teaches that he is like one who strikes an animal, he must pay money.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Dostai ben Yehudah):</span> "An eye in place of an eye" refers to money (the value of the eye);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it literally means that he loses his eye!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If the damager's eye was bigger than the victim's, that would not fulfill "an eye in place of an eye".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps in such a case, money is paid (but not when their eyes are equal)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "There will be one law for you" - one law for all of you.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if the damager's eye is bigger, (the primary damage was that) he deprived the victim of sight, so he will lose his sight!</p></div>
