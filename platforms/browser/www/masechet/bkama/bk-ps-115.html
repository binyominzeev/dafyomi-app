<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO BUYS FROM A THIEF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Reuven stole something from Shimon, and sold it to Levi, and it became known that Reuven stole it, the claim is against the first one. (Shimon can demand payment only from Reuven. Levi need not return the stolen object for free.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The claim is against the second one (Shimon can demand the stolen object from Levi for free).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> They do not argue. If Levi bought it before Shimon despaired, Shimon can demand the stolen object from Levi for free. If Levi bought it after Shimon despaired, Levi need not return it for free;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Both of them hold like Rav Chisda;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If Shimon stole from Yehudah, Yehudah did not despair of getting it back, and Levi came and ate it, also Levi stole from Yehudah, Yehudah may collect from either one he wants.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> They argue about gifts to a Kohen, and this is like before despair!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If David told Moshe 'sell to me your cow's innards (which includes the stomach, one of the Matanos (gifts given to a Kohen when a Chulin animal is slaughtered))', David must give the stomach to a Kohen, and he pays Moshe the full price of the innards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he paid by weight, David must give the stomach to a Kohen, and he demands compensation from Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This is only if David weighed the meat himself. If Moshe weighed it, (David need not give the Kohen for free;) the Kohen's (only) claim is from Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, Rav means that the Kohen may demand the stomach from David for free, or he may even claim from Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that Matanos cannot be stolen (wherever they are, they belong to the Kohen, the only claim is against David). Rav teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Abaye, what do Rav and R. Yochanan argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about Rav Chisda's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid):</span> Rav and R. Yochanan argue when Shimon despaired after Levi bought it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan holds that one (e.g. a buyer) acquires through Shinuy Reshus (change of ownership) after the owner despaired, but not through despair after Shinuy Reshus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav holds that in either case, he acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> All agree that Shimon gets the stolen object back for free (if he never despaired). They argue about whether or not an enactment was made for buyers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav said 'the claim is against the first one', i.e. Levi (the buyer) can demand payment only from Reuven (the thief).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan said 'the claim is against the second one' - an enactment was made that if Levi prefers, he may demand payment from Shimon (who may then claim from Reuven).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rav really hold that no enactment was made for buyers?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chanan Bisha stole a garment and sold it. Rav Huna (Rav's Talmid) told the owner to redeem it from the buyer (i.e. to pay for it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case of Chanan Bisha is different. Since the buyer cannot receive his money from him, it is as if the thief was not found.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CONDITION OF THE ENACTMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> No enactment was made for one who bought from a known thief.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chanan Bisha was a known thief, and an enactment was made for one who bought from him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was known to be evil (Bisha), but not necessarily to be a thief.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If a thief stole and paid up a loan, or a debt for goods received, no enactment was made;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because the money or goods were not given due to the stolen object.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If the thief gave the stolen object for collateral, if it was worth 200 for a loan of 100, an enactment was made;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> If it was worth the same as the loan, no enactment was made.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> Also in this case an enactment was made.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If a stolen object was sold for its value, an enactment was made.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> If it was sold for twice its value, no enactment was made;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Also in this case an enactment was made;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah is, an enactment was made in all cases, except for when it was given to pay a loan or debt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Ploni owed four Zuz to Avimi bar Gazi, Ravina's father- in-law. Ploni stole a garment and gave it to Avimi, who then lent him four more Zuz. The theft became known.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> Regarding the first four Zuz, no enactment was made when it was given to pay a loan or debt (Avimi does not get them from the owner);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Avimi can demand the last four Zuz (before returning the garment). The garment was collateral for the second loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kohen):</span> Perhaps the garment was payment for the first loan, and not collateral for the second, just like the first loan was without collateral!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> The Halachah follows Rav Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Reuven stole Yehudah's Sefer and sold it to Shimon for 80 Zuz, who then sold it to Levi for 120 Zuz. It became known that Reuven stole it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Yehudah pays Levi 80 Zuz, and gets his Sefer. Shimon pays 40 Zuz to Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> An enactment was made for one who buys from a thief (to get everything he paid before returning the stolen object), all the more so an enactment was made for one who bought from one who bought from a thief!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, Yehudah pays Levi 120 Zuz, and gets his Sefer; Yehudah gets 40 from Shimon (Shimon's profit) and 80 Zuz from the thief.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SOMETHING ABOUT TO BE LOST</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Levi was carrying a barrel of wine, and Yehudah was carrying a jug of honey, and Yehudah's barrel cracked, and Levi spilled out his wine and saved the honey, he is paid only like a worker (he is not compensated for the wine he sacrificed);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">115b----------------------------------------115b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Levi said 'I will save your honey and you will pay for my wine', Yehudah must give him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A flooding river overcame the donkeys of Reuven and Shimon, and Reuven neglected his own donkey (worth 100) to save Shimon's (worth 200), he is paid only like a worker (he is not compensated for the loss of his donkey).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'I will save yours and you will pay for mine', Shimon must pay him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does he get only like a worker? The honey was going to be lost, it is like Hefker!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If a man was carrying jugs of wine and oil, and saw that they were breaking, he may not make the wine and oil Terumah to exempt what he has in his house. If he did, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses a case like R. Yirmiyah said (below), there is a basket around the barrel (holding the pieces of the barrel in place. The honey would have dripped out slowly. It could have been saved.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In Beraisa #1, why is the Terumah invalid?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If Reuven was carrying coins, and an extortionist approached him, Reuven may not redeem the Kedushah of coins in his house onto the coins he is carrying. If he did so, it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the case is that he can save them from the extortionist.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should be allowed to redeem l'Chatchilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He can save only with difficulty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that whenever a loss is impending, he may not endow (the money or Peros) with Kedushah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Levi had 10 barrels of Tamei Ma'aser Rishon (of wine) that was Tevel (Terumas Ma'aser had not been separated from it), and one broke or was uncovered (one may not drink it, lest a snake left venom in it), he may declare it to be Terumas Ma'aser on the other nine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding oil he may not do so, for this causes a loss to the Kohen (he could have benefited from burning Tamei oil of Terumas Ma'aser).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmiyah):</span> There is a basket around the barrel. (The wine or oil could have been saved, therefore he may declare wine to be Terumas Ma'aser, and even regarding oil it takes effect.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT MAY BE MADE <i>TERUMAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, if the barrel broke, the wine may be gathered. But if it was uncovered, what may it be used for? (Perhaps there is venom in it! Why may he make it Terumas Ma'aser?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He may sprinkle it to scent the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> Exposed wine may not be poured in the Reshus ha'Rabim, used to knead mud, sprinkled on the floor, or fed to an animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After straining it, it may be used, according to R. Nechemyah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We are concerned for exposure of dregs on a strainer through which the wine filters down (into a bottom Kli);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Nechemyah says, this is only if the bottom Kli is exposed. We are not concerned if the top Kli is exposed, because snake's venom floats and stays on top.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Simon taught that that is only when the wine filters through by itself, but if the top Kli was shaken, the poison mixes with the wine and goes through! (The same applies if the wine is poured into the strainer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One can put the strainer on the mouth of the barrel and pour it straight through.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa permits separating Tamei Peros to be Terumah. It cannot be like R. Nechemyah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may separate Tamei Peros to be Terumah on Tamei Peros, or Tahor Peros to be Terumah on Tahor or Tamei Peros, but not Tamei Peros to be Terumah on Tahor Peros;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Nechemyah says, even Tamei Peros on Tamei Peros is permitted only for Demai (doubtfully tithed Peros).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses Demai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Regarding oil he may not do so, because this causes a loss to the Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, we are concerned because a Kohen can benefit by burning Tamei oil. Also regarding wine, he can sprinkle it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Sprinkling is insignificant.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shmuel taught, one should pay up to a Sela for a Log of wine to drink, and up to two Sela'im for a Log of wine to sprinkle!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is new wine unfit for sprinkling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Kohen can keep it until it is fit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned for a pitfall (lest someone drink it. Tamei Terumah is forbidden to everyone).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also regarding oil, we should be concerned for a pitfall!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He can put it in a filthy container, so no one will drink it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He can do the same with wine!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If we did, it would not be fit for sprinkling.</p>
