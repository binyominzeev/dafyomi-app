<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 17 (18 Teves) - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the ninth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HONORABLE BURIAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>"They honored (Chizkiyahu) in his death" - they learned by his grave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Nasan and Rabanan argued about whether they learned for three days or for seven, or according to another version, for 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "They honored (Chizkiyahu) in his death" - 36,000 people with bare shoulders (from having torn their garments) walked in front of him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Nechemyah:</span> They did the same for Achav (surely, the verse discusses a greater honor for Chizkiyahu)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, they put a Sefer Torah on his bed, and said that he fulfilled all that is written in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also we do that nowadays!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We take out a Sefer Torah, but we do not put it on the bed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We put it on the bed, but we do not say that he fulfilled all that is written in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> I asked R. Yochanan about this. He needed to relieve himself. He didn't answer until he washed his hands, put his Tefilin back on and blessed on them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> We even say that one fulfilled the Torah, but we do not say that he taught Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Learning is great because it leads to fulfilling (this shows that fulfilling is greater)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Fulfilling is greater than learning, but teaching is greater than fulfilling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Happy are you who put seeds on all water, who send oxen and donkeys (to thresh and carry the grain)" - anyone who engages in Torah and Chesed merits the inheritance of two tribes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Putting seeds" is Tzedakah - "sow for yourselves Tzedakah; you will reap according to the Chesed (that Hash-m will do for you)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Water" refers to Torah - "all who are thirsty, go to water".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> They merit a canopy (to be blessed with many children) like Yosef, "Ben Poras Yosef Banos Tza'adah Alei Shor" and wealth like Yisachar, "Yisachar Chamor Garem";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Their enemies fall in front of them, like Yosef, "(Bechor Shoro...) ba'Hem Amim Yenagach", and they merit understanding like Yisachar, "umi'Bnei Yisachar Yod'ei Vinah..."</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK KEITZAD HA'REGEL</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REGEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> How is Regel Mu'ad? A Behemah (animal) is Mu'ad to break things when it walks normally.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was kicking, or pebbles were being strewn by its feet and Kelim were broken, it pays half- damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If it trampled on a Kli and broke it, and (fragments) broke another Kli, it pays full damage for the first Kli, and half-damage for the second.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chickens are Mu'ad to walk normally and break things;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If something was tied to its leg, or if it was dancing and broke Kelim, it pays half-damage.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Ravina) Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah switch from 'Regel' to 'Behemah'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Regel is the Av. Other parts of the animal are the Toldos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> The Seifa of our Mishnah (19b) switches from 'Shen' to 'Behemah'. What Toldos of Shen does it refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It refers to Shen of Chayos (wild animals) and Behemos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that "he will send Be'iro" refers only to a Behemah. The Tana teaches that this is not so. 'Be'iro' includes Chayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah should teach Behemah before (Shen, which alludes to) Chayos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah did not explicitly teach Chayos. The Tana needed to expound it (we find that  Devarim 14:4 says "Behemah", and includes Chayos). Therefore it is dear to him, so he taught it first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also regarding Regel, the Tana should first teach other parts of the animal, which the Torah did not explicitly teach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Regarding Shen, both are Avos, so he lists first the one that is not explicit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Regel, it is improper to list the Toldah (its body) before the Av (the Regel)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Since the previous Mishnah (15b) concluded with Regel, our Mishnah begins with Regel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PEBBLES (<i>TZEROROS</i>)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An animal is Mu'ad to walk normally and break things;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If it entered the victim's premises, it pays full damage for damage any of the following: its body or hair as it walked; its saddle, bag, bridle in its mouth, or bell on its neck; a donkey with its load;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Sumchus says, the following pay full damage:</span> pebbles, or a pig that was digging with its snout in the waste- heap and damaged.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a pig damaged, of course it pays full damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it strewed up refuse and damaged.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Sumchus mention pebbles? The first Tana did not discuss this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated. It means as follows: for pebbles kicked up normally, it pays half- damage. If a pig was digging and strewed up refuse and damaged, it pays half-damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sumchus says, these cases pay full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If chickens fluttered from place to place and broke Kelim with their wings - they pay full damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If the wind from their wings broke the Kelim, they pay half-damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Sumchus says, they pay full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If chickens were dancing on a dough or fruits and dirtied or pecked holes in them, they pay full damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If they kicked up dirt or pebbles, they pay half- damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Sumchus says, they pay full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a chicken was fluttering from place to place, and wind from its wings broke Kelim, it pays half- damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This anonymous Mishnah is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN IS <i>KO'ACH</i> CONSIDERED <i>TZEROROS</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We understand Sumchus. He holds that impetus (the damager set something in motion, and it damaged) is like bodily damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Chachamim hold that it is like bodily damage, they should obligate full damage. If it is unlike bodily damage, it should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is like bodily damage. A tradition from Moshe from Sinai teaches that one pays only half for damage caused by pebbles that the animal kicks ("Tzeroros").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Any case in which a Zav is Metamei (i.e. touching), a similar case of damage pays full damage. Any case in which a Zav is not Metamei (e.g. an object hit by something he threw), a similar case of damage pays half- damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rava just teach the law of Tzeroros?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. He teaches about a calf pulling a wagon (it pays full damage if the wagon damages, and half-damage if it strews up pebbles and they damage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> An animal is Mu'ad to break things as it walks. If it entered the victim's premises, it pays full damage for damage by its body... or a calf pulling a wagon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If chickens were pecking at the rope of a bucket, and the rope snapped and the bucket broke, they pay full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If an animal stepped on a Kli, and it rolled to another place and broke there, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does it depend on the beginning, and it is like bodily damage (since it stepped on the Kli)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does it depend on when it breaks, and it is like Tzeroros (since the animal was not touching it when it broke)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should learn from Rabah's law!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If Reuven threw a Kli off the roof, and Shimon broke in it mid-air with a stick, Shimon is exempt, for it was already (destined to be) broken. (This shows that it depends on the beginning!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava was unsure whether or not Rabah's law is true.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> Dancing (of chickens) is not Mu'ad;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say, it is Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, dancing is Mu'ad!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if chickens danced and kicked a Kli (and it broke elsewhere); the two Tana'im hold like the two sides of Rava's doubt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Beraisa discusses when it strewed up pebbles, i.e. the argument of Sumchus and Chachamim.</p>
