<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DO WE SAY HO'IL?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav bar Sheva - Mishnah):</span> [If Yom Tov is before Shabbos,] how can one be Me'arev [for both days without risking lest the Eruv get lost]? He takes the Eruv [to the desired place of Shevisah] on Erev Yom Tov, stays there until nightfall, and takes it home with him. The next day he takes it back and stays there until nightfall. He may then eat it and return.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>[Why must he bring the Eruv?] We should say Ho'il (since) he could take it with him, it is as if he took it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> We decree that he must take it due to when Yom Tov follows Shabbos. (Then, the Eruv is valid only if it is there. Ho'il does not apply, since he may not carry it on Shabbos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one intended to be Shoves in Reshus ha'Rabim and put his Eruv in a wall [outside his four Amos]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is below 10 Tefachim, it is valid. If it is above 10, it is invalid. (He cannot access it Bein ha'Shemashos);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he intended to be Shoves on top of a dovecote or cabinet [and put the Eruv in a wall nearby - this is like Rashi's preferred explanation (v'I Ika)]:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the Eruv is above 10 (he and his Eruv are both in Reshus ha'Yachid), it is valid. If it is below 10, it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We should say that even below 10 it is valid, for he could tilt the cabinet to below 10. (It would be a Karmelis. There would be no Isur Torah to take it!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The Beraisa discusses a cabinet nailed into the wall. (One cannot tilt it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Even if it is not nailed in, if it is so tall that if he would tilt it below 10, the top (his Shevisah) would be four Amos away from his Eruv [the Eruv is invalid. It would be an Isur Torah to carry it through Reshus ha'Rabim to bring it. Alternatively, his Eruv would not be in his place of Shevisah.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there is a window [in the cabinet next to the Eruv] and he holds a rope (the other end is tied to the Eruv), he could use it to bring the Eruv!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, there is no window or he has no rope.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>AN ERUV IN A PIT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it is in a pit, even 100 Amos deep [it is valid].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where is the pit?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is in a Reshus ha'Yachid, obviously it is valid. Just like Reshus ha'Yachid extends up to the sky, it descends to any depth! (Even if he intended to be Shoves above, he can take his Eruv.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is in a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did he intend to be Shoves?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he intended to be Shoves above, he and his Eruv are in different places!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he intended to be Shoves in the pit, obviously it is valid. He and his Eruv are in the same place!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is in Karmelis, and he intended to be Shoves above. Our Mishnah is like Rebbi, who permits Shevus during Bein ha'Shemashos. (Therefore, he may take his Eruv from the pit.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AN ERUV ON TOP OF A REED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he put the Eruv on top of a reed or pole, if it was initially detached and later inserted into the ground, it is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Ada bar Masnah) Question:</span> The Eruv is valid only if it was detached and later inserted. If it was attached, it would be invalid!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like Chachamim, who forbid Shevus (e.g. using something attached) during Bein ha'Shemashos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We established the Reisha (the previous Mishnah) to be Rebbi. Is the Reisha Rebbi and the Seifa Chachamim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Rami bar Chama already asked this. Rav Chisda answered that indeed, the Reisha is Rebbi and the Seifa is Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> Also the Seifa is Rebbi. He decrees to forbid [an attached reed] lest one cut off the top when taking his Eruv. (We are not concerned for this regarding a tree, for it does not break easily.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The king's army came to Neharda'a. (This caused a lack of room for Talmidim.) Rav Nachman said [to his Talmidim] 'go bend reeds. Tomorrow (Shabbos) we will sit on them.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama - Mishnah):</span> If it (the reed) was initially detached and later inserted, the Eruv is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the reed is attached, the Eruv is invalid! (This shows that an attached reed is like a tree, and it is forbidden on Shabbos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> That refers to Uzradin (reeds that became hard like a tree).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to distinguish Uzradin from regular reeds?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #1):</span> Reeds, thorns and Hegin (a prickly tree) are kinds of trees. They are not Kil'ayim in a vineyard;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> Reeds, Kidan (costus, an ingredient of the Ketores) and Urbanin (Rashi - a species of willow; Tosfos - a certain vegetable) are kinds of vegetables. They are Kil'ayim in a vineyard.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Beraisa #1 discusses Uzradin. Beraisa #2 discusses regular reeds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Kidah is not a vegetable!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not graft Pigam (rue, an herb) onto white Kidah, for this is a vegetable on a tree.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Kidah and white Kidah (cassia) are different.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>AN ERUV LOCKED IN A CABINET</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Me'arev in a cabinet and lost the key, even so it is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, if he does not know where the key is, it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is it valid? [Since he cannot access his Eruv, it is as if] he and his Eruv are in different places!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav and Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah discusses a cabinet of arranged bricks [not cemented together]. The first Tana is like R. Meir, who permits opening it:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a house full of produce was sealed, and part [of the wall] fell [on Shabbos or Yom Tov], one may take produce through the opening;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir says, one may pierce [the wall] and take l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Ada):</span> The Mishnah discusses arranged bricks. (One may not pierce a proper wall.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Likewise, our Mishnah discusses bricks arranged like a cabinet!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Zeira taught that this is permitted only on Yom Tov, but not on Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, also our Mishnah permits only on Yom Tov, but not on Shabbos!</p></div>
