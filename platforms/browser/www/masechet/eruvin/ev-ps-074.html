<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CONDITIONS TO PERMIT A MAVOY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A Lechi or Korah permits a Mavoy only if houses and Chatzeros are open to it. (Here, Rashi says that two houses must open to each Chatzer. Above (12b), he said that one opens to each Chatzer);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Even if one house and one Chatzer open to it [a Lechi or Korah permits it];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even a ruin [and a Chatzer with a house suffice for a Lechi or Korah to permit it].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Does R. Yochanan say that even a path in a vineyard suffices?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> No. He requires [at least] a ruin, for it can be used for Dirah. A path cannot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Chinena):</span> R. Yochanan is consistent with what he taught elsewhere:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Roofs, Chatzeros and Karfifos are considered one Reshus for Kelim that were Shoves in them, but not for Kelim that were Shoves in the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon, on condition that they were not Me'arev;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If they were Me'arev, we decree not to transfer [even what was Shoves in a Chatzer to another Chatzer], lest one transfer what was Shoves in a house to another Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel and R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon, whether or not they were Me'arev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We do not decree lest one transfer what was Shoves in a house to another Chatzer. Similarly, here, we do not decree lest one transfer what was Shoves in the Chatzer (Bach - a house) to the ruin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Rav Beruna recited these teachings. R. Elazar was skeptical if Shmuel really said so, so he asked him personally.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> Yes, I said so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> you taught that regarding Eruvin we may not permit more than is implied by the words of the Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [The relation of] a Mavoy to Chatzer<i>os</i> is like a Chatzer to house<i>s</i> (a Mavoy is permitted [through a Lechi or Korah] only if [at least] two Chatzeros open to it, and two houses open to each Chatzer).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Shmuel did not answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did Shmuel accept R. Elazar's words [and retract, and hold like Rav]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Eivus bar Ihi made a Lechi for the Mavoy in which he lived. (Only one Chatzer and one house opened to it.) Shmuel approved;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">74b----------------------------------------74b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>[After Shmuel died,] Rav Anan knocked down the Lechi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Eivus:</span> Shmuel approved of it, and you knock it down?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This shows that Shmuel did not retract.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, he retracted [and required houses and Chatzeros, like Rav]. The case was, an overseer of a Beis ha'Keneses [open to the Mavoy] used to eat in his house and sleep in the Beis ha'Keneses. (He ceased to sleep there after Shmuel died);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Eivus held that one's residence is where he eats. He assumed that Shmuel did not permit due to the Beis ha'Keneses;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>[Rav Anan knew that] really, Shmuel holds that residence is where one sleeps. (The Beis ha'Keneses used to count like a house open to its Chatzer. Now that the overseer ceased to sleep there, the Chatzer was lacking a house, so only one proper Chatzer opened to the Mavoy.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A NOCHRI ON ONE SIDE OF A MAVOY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If there is a Nochri at one side of a Mavoy and a Yisrael (Reuven) at the other side, [Yisraelim in houses with windows open to Reuven] may not be Me'arev through the windows to permit taking their Kelim through the openings to the Mavoyõ (See the diagram in Rashiõ)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Does Rav say this even regarding a Chatzer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Yes! If not, what would you have thought?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> One might have thought that Rav forbids due to another of his teachings, that a Lechi or Korah permits a Mavoy only if houses and Chatzeros open to the Mavoy.</p></div>
