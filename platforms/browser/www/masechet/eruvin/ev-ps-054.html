<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> Had they not been broken, no nation would have been able to rule over Yisrael. We read "Charus" like 'Cherus' (freedom, due to the Luchos).</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> When a person makes himself Hefker to all like a Midbar (wilderness), Torah is given to him like a gift. After this, it is like a Nachalah (inheritance) to him. Then, he is elevated (Bamos);</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Some say, he must be like a Chayah that dirties its food before eating. (Maharsha - he is so engrossed in learning that he neglects to ensure that his food is prepared nicely, as befits a Chacham.)</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Ya'alas Chen" - Torah gives grace [and honor] to those who learn it (Maharsha - even though they often neglect their food and appearance);</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Dimi):</span> This is a parable. If a hunter breaks the wings of each bird he catches before hunting the next, he will keep all of them. If not, it will not (they will fly away).</p></div>
