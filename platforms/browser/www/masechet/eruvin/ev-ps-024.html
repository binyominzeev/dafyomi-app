<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A PARTIALLY CULTIVATED <i>KARFEF</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction - Inference:</span> (The Beraisa forbids a Karfef more than Beis Sa'atayim if the majority was seeded.) If the minority was seeded, it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> This is only if [the seeded area] is less than Beis Sa'atayim. If it is Beis Sa'atayim, it is forbidden. (It is like a Karfef unto itself. Normally, a Karfef of this size is permitted. Here it is forbidden because nothing separates it from the unseeded part, which is like a Chatzer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This is like Chachamim [of R. Shimon, who forbid transferring between a Karfef and a Chatzer. Therefore, these places forbid each other.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Yirmeyah mi'Difti - (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> This is only if [the seeded area] is at most Beis Sa'atayim. If it is more, it is forbidden [like any Karfef above Beis Sa'atayim].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This is like R. Shimon [but Chachamim forbid even Beis Sa'atayim, like we explained above].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the majority was planted [with trees], it is like a Chatzer, and one may carry in it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Avimi):</span> This is only if it is planted in rows. (It is convenient to sit there.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> This is even if it is not planted in rows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Mar Yehudah visited Rav Huna bar Yehudah; he saw people carrying [in a Karfef above Beis Sa'atayim that was mostly planted, but not in rows].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Mar Yehudah:</span> Don't you hold like Avimi?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Huna bar Yehudah:</span> I hold like Rav Nachman.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PERMITTING SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT HUKAF L'DIRAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If a Karfef more than Beis Sa'atayim was not Hukaf l'Dirah, one can breach a wall more than 10 Amos, and fence it to reduce the breach to 10, and then it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one breached one Amah and fenced it, breached another Amah and fenced it (in the end, more than 10 Amos were breached), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> This is like the case of the broken sandal!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a [wooden] Kli of a Ba'al ha'Bayis (i.e. not a craftsman) has a hole k'Rimon (the size of a pomegranate), it is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Chizkiyah):</span> If a Kli got a hole the size of k'Zayis, and it was sealed, and got another hole k'Zayis, and it was sealed, until the area of the holes in total was k'Rimon, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> You taught us regarding a sandal. We can learn from there!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a flap of a sandal [that is Tamei Medras, i.e. an Av ha'Tum'ah] snapped and was fixed, the sandal is still Tamei Medras;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If the other flap snapped and was fixed, it is Tahor from Medras, but it is Tamei like Maga (something that touched a) Medras.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> After the first flap snapped it is [still] Tamei Medras due to the other flap. Also after the second one snaps, it should be Tamei Medras due to the first, which was fixed!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Chizkiyah):</span> Panim Chodoshos have come. (Since enough has broken to be Mevatel it from being a sandal [had nothing been fixed], it is as if what remains is not the same sandal that received Tum'as Medras.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Likewise regarding a Kli, Panim Chodoshos have come! (It is as if there was a hole k'Rimon, so it is Tahor. Rav Nachman's answer is that also regarding the Karfef, Panim Chodoshos have come. It is as if more than 10 Amos were breached at once. It is now Hukaf l'Dirah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Chizkiyah:</span> R. Yochanan is [an angel, and] not a human!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Chizkiyah:</span> R. Yochanan is [the paradigm of greatness possible in] a human!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> In a Rechavah (this is like a Chatzer, but houses do not open to it and it is) in back of houses, one may carry only within four Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If one made an opening to it [from his house], he may carry in the entire Rechavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This is only if he made an opening and later surrounded [the Rechavah by a wall]. If he surrounded and later made an opening, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If he opened and later surrounded, obviously it is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, there is a granary between his house and the wall;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that he opened and surrounded for the sake of the granary. He teaches that this is not so. (Rather, it was for the Rechavah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> If a Karfef more than Beis Sa'atayim was Hukaf l'Dirah and became full of water, it is as if it was seeded (if the majority was seeded, it is like a garden), and it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Aba):</span> Rava taught that it is as if it was planted, and it is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> That is only if it is usable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Even if it is usable, this is only if the water is not [10 Tefachim] deep over an area of more than Beis Sa'atayim. If it is, it is forbidden [for it is abnormal to make such a big trench of water].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>This is wrong. It is like a giant pile of fruits. (It is not Mevatel Shem Dirah.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE RECHAVAH OF FUM NAHARA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There was a Rechavah in Fum Nahara. One end opened to [a Mavoy of] the city, and the other end opened to an [inhabited] path through vineyards. The path ended at the riverbank [which was considered a wall, for it was 10 Tefachim deep. See Perush Chai diagram, Perek 2 number 92, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-2chai092.jpg>English Charts</a> section.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> How can we permit it? (It was more than Beis Sa'atayim, and already Hukaf but not l'Dirah. The wall was very solid, so it was difficult to breach and fix it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We cannot make a wall on top of the bank [to join the path to the Rechavah] l'Shem Dirah, for a wall on top of a wall does not help.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can make Tzuras ha'Pesach at the opening of the path [to the river]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Camels pass through [to drink]. They would knock it down. (It was a narrow opening.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We make a Lechi at the opening of the path [to the Rechavah]. Since it permits the path, it permits also the Rechavah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> People will think that a Lechi permits a regular path in a vineyard [which is open at both ends]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We make a Lechi at the opening [of the Rechavah] to the Mavoy. Since it permits the Mavoy, it permits also the Rechavah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>This permits to carry in the Mavoy itself, and in the Rechavah itself;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha or Ravina):</span> One may not transfer between the Mavoy and the Rechavah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Acha and Ravina):</span> It is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The latter opinion permits because the Rechavah lacks residents [to forbid the Mavoy];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The former opinion forbids because sometimes it has residents, and people might inadvertently carry [like they are used to].</p></div>
