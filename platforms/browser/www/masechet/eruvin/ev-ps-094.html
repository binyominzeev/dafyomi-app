<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A WALL THAT FELL ON SHABBOS (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If the wall between two Chatzeros fell, one may not carry [in either Chatzer] more than four Amos;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> People of each Chatzer may carry up to where the wall was.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rav did not say this explicitly. It was inferred from the following episode:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav and Shmuel were in a Chatzer. The wall between it and the adjoining Chatzer fell.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> Spread a garment where the wall used to be.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rav turned his face away. (He forbids to do so.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> Rav disapproves. Use his belt to tie the garment!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Shmuel need to spread a garment? He holds that people of each Chatzer may carry up to where the wall was!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did so merely for privacy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Rav forbids, he should have said so explicitly!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was Shmuel's region. (It is improper for a colleague to rule against the local Chacham.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did he turn his face away?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not want people to think that he agrees with Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A CHATZER THAT WAS BREACHED TO RESHUS HA'RABIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If [the wall of] a Chatzer was breached to Reshus ha'Rabim, one who throws from it to Reshus ha'Yachid or vice-versa is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim exempt one who throws from it to Reshus ha'Rabim [or to Reshus ha'Yachid] or vice-versa, for it is a Karmelis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Does R. Eliezer consider it a Reshus ha'Rabim just because it is breached to Reshus ha'Rabim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! This is like he taught elsewhere:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah citing R. Eliezer):</span> If the public chose a path [through Reuven's field], they keep it. (He may not block it up.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Gidal taught that the case is, they had a path in his field, but do not know on which side [and they chose one side. Normally, they would not keep it!]</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is the case in our Mishnah. (A wall of the Chatzer fell, and the Bnei Chatzer claim that the Rabim widened their path, and incorporated part of the Chatzer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Chanina taught that the argument is up to the place of the wall [that fell. This implies that R. Eliezer considers the entire Chatzer to be Reshus ha'Rabim. Surely, the path did not encompass his entire Chatzer!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Chanina taught that the argument is <i>about</i> (not up to) the place of the wall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> (We know where the wall used to be.) Rather, R. Eliezer holds that Tzidei (a shoulder of) Reshus ha'Rabim is like Reshus ha'Rabim, and Chachamim disagree.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't they argue about a normal case of Tzidei Reshus ha'Rabim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, one might have thought that Chachamim argue only [about a standard case,] when there are Chifufei (pegs sticking out of the ground to distance the Rabim from the walls. They separate between Reshus ha'Rabim and Tzidei Reshus ha'Rabim. See Perush Chai diagram, Perek 9 number 71, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-9chai071.jpg>English Charts</a> section), but they agree when there are no Chifufei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Mishnah he obligates one who throws <i>mi'Toch</i> (from the interior of) the Chatzer to Reshus ha'Yachid! (Only the place of the fallen wall is Tzidei Reshus ha'Rabim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (He does not obligate from the interior.) Since Chachamim say mi'Toch, he uses the same words.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If R. Eliezer obligates only Tzidei Reshus ha'Rabim, why do Chachamim reply with [the law of throwing from] the inside?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They say, don't you agree that one who throws from inside to Reshus ha'Yachid or vice-versa is exempt, because it is a Karmelis? The same applies to the edge (Tzidei Reshus ha'Rabim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer distinguishes between them. Rabim traverse the edge, but not the inside.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A WALL THAT WAS BREACHED ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If [on Shabbos] a Chatzer or house was breached on two sides, or if the Lechi or Korah was removed from a Mavoy, it is permitted for that Shabbos and forbidden in the future;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi says, if it is permitted for that Shabbos it is permitted in the future. If it is forbidden for the future it is forbidden for that Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (The Mishnah implies that a breach on one side does not forbid.) What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> The breach is [at most] 10 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it does not forbid on one side because it is an opening. The same applies to two sides!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> The breach is more than 10 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it should forbid even on one side!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Defense (of Suggestion #1 - Rav):</span> Really, it is 10. The case is, the breach is in [a place that is like two sides, i.e.] a corner. People do not make openings in corners.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">94b----------------------------------------94b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The same applies to a house that was breached on two sides.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A breach on one side does not forbid because Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem. We should also say this for two sides!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei Rav citing Rav):</span> The case is, the breach is in a corner, and the roof was breached on a diagonal (Tosfos; Rashi - the roof is sloped), so we do not say Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Defense (of Suggestion #2, regarding a Chatzer - Shmuel):</span> Really, the breach is more than 10 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should forbid even on one side!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana discusses when two sides were breached, for this forbids also regarding a house.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> A breach on one side of a house does not forbid because Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem. We should say this also for two sides!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Shmuel does not say Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may carry anywhere in an Achsadra in a valley [because Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem. Rashi - it has no walls. Tosfos - it has two adjacent walls or three walls];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may carry only within four Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer (to Question #2):</span> Shmuel does not apply Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem in four places, but he applies it in three.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer (to Question #2):</span> Shmuel does not apply Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem when there are three [physical] walls, but he applies it when there are four [even if one wall is a mere Lechi, or even if two are]. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Question #1 is still difficult!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav answered that the breach is in a corner and the roof was breached diagonally (or is sloped). Shmuel can answer [somewhat] similarly. I.e. the breaches are in adjacent sides. (Together they are more than 10 Amos. Also, the width of four Amos (Rashash - Tefachim) of the roof over these breaches fell [like the picture in Rashi]. Since walls are lacking in four places, Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem does not permit. If only one side was breached, Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem would apply because the roof is flat and was not breached diagonally.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel did not answer like Rav because the Mishnah does not say [that the roof was breached on a] diagonal (Rashi - that it is sloped);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav did not answer like Shmuel, for then it is like an Achsadra, and Rav permits an Achsadra.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may carry anywhere in an Achsadra in a valley, because Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may carry only within four Amos. We do not say Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> All agree that breaches [in the Achsadra] up to 10 Amos do not forbid (they are like openings, due to (Tosfos; Rashi - even without) Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem). They argue about breaches more than 10.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> All agree that breaches more than 10 forbid. They argue about breaches no more than 10.</p></div>
