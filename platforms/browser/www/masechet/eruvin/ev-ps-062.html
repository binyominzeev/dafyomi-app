<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHY DOES A NOCHRI'S RESHUS FORBID?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(Gemara - Abaye bar Avin and Rav Chinena bar Avin) Question: We understand R. Meir (the first Tana). He holds that Diras Nochri Shmei Dirah (his residence is significant enough to forbid), whether there are one or more Yisraelim [in the Chatzer]. However, what is R. Eliezer ben Yakov's opinion?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he holds that Diras Nochri Shmei Dirah, he should forbid even when there is only one Yisrael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he holds That Lo Shmei Dirah, he should not forbid even when there are two!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection of premise (Abaye):</span> You assume that R. Meir holds that Diras Nochri Shmei Dirah. This is wrong!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Nochri's Chatzer is like a barnyard (it does not forbid. The full text of this Beraisa is brought at the end of this Amud, and it explicitly says that the Reisha is R. Meir.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> All agree that Lo Shmei Dirah. They argue about the decree [that a Nochri forbids, in order to discourage Yisraelim from living with him] lest Yisraelim learn from his ways:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer holds that it is uncommon that a lone Yisrael would live with a Nochri, for [Chachamim forbid to do so, since (Rambam - some)] Nochrim are suspected of murdering. We decree only when there are two Yisraelim, for this is common;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir decrees even about a lone Yisrael, for sometimes a Yisrael lives alone with a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim enacted that Eruv and Bitul do not help when a Nochri is there. The only Heter is to rent his property, and [probably] he will not rent it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why won't he rent his property?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He is concerned lest the Yisraelim try to permanently keep it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Partial rejection:</span> This is like the opinion that requires a strong rental (this will be explained). According to the opinion that a weak rental suffices, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> We require a strong rental.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> A weak rental suffices.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are strong and weak rentals?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A strong rental is when one pays a Perutah, and a weak rental is when he pays less than a Perutah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> All agree that rental for less than a Perutah suffices!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak citing R. Yochanan):</span> One may rent from a Nochri for less than a Perutah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> A Nochri is Chayav Misah for stealing less than a Perutah [from a Nochri, for they are concerned for small amounts, and they do not pardon]. He has no Mitzvah to return it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, a strong rental is when one buys the right to fill the Chatzer with benches and chairs (Rashi. R. Chananel - he buys rights to build. Aruch - they sign a document in front of clerks of the mayor.) A weak rental is without this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Repeat of question:</span> According to the opinion that a weak rental suffices, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Nochri will not rent because he is concerned for witchcraft. (R. Yehonason - he suspects this because he offers to lend it for free, and the Yisrael insists on renting it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A Nochri's Chatzer is like a barnyard. [Visiting] Yisraelim may transfer from the houses to the Chatzer or vice-versa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Yisrael resides in the Chatzer, he forbids [Yisraelim from taking from Nochri houses to the Chatzer];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, he does not forbid [taking from any house to the Chatzer] unless two Yisraelim in the Chatzer forbid each other.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">62b----------------------------------------62b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Nochri's Chatzer is like a barnyard. (He does not forbid taking from a Yisrael's house to the Chatzer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If a Yisrael lives in a Chatzer with a Nochri, he (the Nochri) forbids [a Yisrael to take from his own house to the Chatzer].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> The Nochri forbids when he is there, but not when he is away.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's opinion [about one who is away]?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Dirah of one who is away is considered Dirah, a Nochri should forbid even when he is away;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is not considered Dirah, a Yisrael should not forbid when he is away!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not considered Dirah. We decree about a Yisrael who is away [to consider it Dirah] due to when he is home;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Nochri's Dirah is never considered Dirah. When he is here we decree [to consider it Dirah], lest Yisraelim learn from his ways. We do not decree when he is away.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do decree when a Nochri is away!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one left his house and went to another city, he forbids, whether he is a Yisrael or Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, he is prone to return the same day. (We forbid, lest people carry even after he returns.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CASES IN WHICH ONE MAY NOT TEACH HALACHOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Eliezer ben Yakov. (We publicly teach this);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The custom is like R. Eliezer ben Yakov. (We do not publicly teach this, but if someone asks we tell him);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> People conducted like R. Eliezer ben Yakov. (We do not suggest this to one who asks, but we do not rebuke one who is lenient like him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> [The rule is,] R. Eliezer ben Yakov taught Kav (few Halachos; Aruch - 102, the Gematriya of 'Kav'), and the Halachah always follows him. Also, Rav Yehudah taught that the Halachah follows him. May one give such a simple ruling in front of his Rebbi?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> No. It is also simple that eggs (Aruch - finished eggs found inside a slaughtered bird) may be eaten with milk, yet Rav Chisda refused to rule about this while Rav Huna (his Rebbi) was alive. (Rashi - Rav Yosef asked Rav Chisda to test if he would rule about this.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yakov bar Aba):</span> Megilas Ta'anis (days when it is forbidden to fast or eulogize) is written. May one give rulings from it in front of his Rebbi?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> No. Rav Yosef said that Rav Chisda refused to rule about eggs and milk while Rav Huna was alive.</p></div>
