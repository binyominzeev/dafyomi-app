<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MAY WE ASSUME THAT TEFILIN ARE KOSHER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> All agree that one does not toil unnecessarily!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(The father of Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak - Beraisa):</span> Tefilin are considered old if they have straps that are tied [to form a 'Dalet' and 'Yud' of Hash-m's name Shakai]. They are new if they have straps and are not tied;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>All agree that one would not toil to make a Kami'a like this. (R. Yehudah forbids because they cannot be worn untied.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One could make a bow [and wear them]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This teaches that a bow is invalid for Tefilin. (A proper knot is required. One may not tie it on Shabbos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> No, R. Yehudah [forbids new Tefilin] based on what he taught elsewhere, that making a bow is [a Melachah] like making a proper knot. (Tosfos - Rav Chisda knew this. He assumes that the Reisha of our Stam Mishnah is like Chachamim. Alternatively, since the bow is temporary (he will tie a proper knot after Shabbos), it is not a Melachah. Even R. Yehudah should permit!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he did not hold that a bow is like a proper knot, he could make a bow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav taught that a tradition from Moshe from Sinai mandates the knot in Tefilin [to form the letters], and Rav Nachman taught that the beauty (the letters formed) must face outside! (A bow will not form the letters.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He makes the bow like the knot of Tefilin [so that the letters will be formed].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If one buys Tefilin from one who is not an expert, he must check two head Tefilin and one arm Tefilin, or vice-versa. (If all are Kosher, he may assume that all of them are Kosher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Either way you say, this is difficult!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If all are from one person, it should suffice to check even three head Tefilin or three arm Tefilin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he bought from different people, each of them needs to be cheched!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All are from one person. We must establish that the scribe can write both kinds of Tefilin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah bar Shmuel taught a Beraisa saying that one checks three head Tefilin v'Shalosh (and/or three) arm Tefilin!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that he checks three head Tefilin <i>or</i> three arm Tefilin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. He checks three Tefilin. Some are head Tefilin and some are arm Tefilin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Kahana taught a Beraisa saying that one checks two Tefilin, one of the head and one of the arm!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is like Rebbi, who says that two occurrences make a Chazakah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> The same applies to the second and third bundle of Tefilin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi would not require checking the third bundle (two bundles makes a Chazakah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi requires checking each bundle when they were bought from different people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should require checking even the fourth and fifth bundles!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this is true. He mentions the third to show that he holds that Chazakah does not apply from bundle to bundle.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DIFFERENT METHODS OF SAVING TEFILIN AND CHILDREN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one finds Tzevasim or Krichos...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Tzevasim and Krichos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They are [essentially] the same. Tzevasim are bundles of pairs [of arm and head Tefilin tied together]. Krichos are big bundles [of individual Tefilin].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He waits there until dark and brings them [after Shabbos].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should bring them one pair at a time!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak brei d'Rav Yehudah citing Rav Yehudah):</span> If one could bring them one pair at a time and finish before dark, he does so. If not [since he will have to return after dark anyway], he waits there until dark and brings them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it is dangerous, one covers them and goes away.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If it is dangerous, one takes them less than four Amos at a time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If the danger is from Nochrim [the kingdom decreed to forbid Tefilin, and kill people who disobey, then in all cases] he covers them and goes away. If it is dangerous to stay there due to bandits [who might desecrate the Tefilin if he leaves them there], he takes them less than four Amos at a time. (This is how Rashi (Amud B) explains our text.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">97b----------------------------------------97b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> You cannot establish the Mishnah to discuss Nochrim, due to the Seifa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Shimon):</span> He gives them to a friend, who [takes them less than four Amos and] gives them to a friend...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>All the more so this should be forbidden, for many people are involved! (The kingdom is likely to find out.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This (he covers them and goes away) is if the danger is from Nochrim. If the danger is due to bandits, he takes them less than four Amos at a time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> He gives them to a friend...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim and R. Shimon argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim hold that it is better for one person to carry them less than four Amos at a time, for when many people are involved it is an open disgrace of Shabbos [in the eyes of ignoramuses who think that it is forbidden - R. Yehonason];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon holds that it is better for many people are involved, for when one takes them less than four Amos at a time, he may forget and carry them four Amos [without stopping] in Reshus ha'Rabim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The same applies to his son.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is his son in the field?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei Menasheh - Beraisa):</span> The case is, his wife gave birth in a field.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say 'even if 100 people are involved'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though it is not good for the baby to be passed so much from person to person, this is better than for one person to carry him less than four Amos at a time [lest he forget...]</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>R. YEHUDAH'S HETER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> One may give a barrel [...even to take it outside the Techum].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yehudah argue with the following Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not take an animal or Kli taken past where its owner may go.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> The case is, he poured the contents from one barrel to another. R. Yehudah permits [to take the water outside the Techum,] like he taught elsewhere, that water is insignificant:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (If people with different Techum contributed ingredients to make dough, one may not take the dough outside the Techum of anyone who contributed.) R. Yehudah says, we are not concerned for [the Techum of the one who gave] the water, for it is insignificant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim say 'Lo Tehalech' (feminine, i.e. the barrel may not be taken...? R. Yehudah agrees to this. He permits only the water!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They mean 'what was inside [the barrel], i.e. the water, may not be taken past where its owner may go.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yehudah taught we are not concerned for the Techum of water absorbed in a dough. We have no source that he is not concerned for water by itself!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says that water in a pot [of cooked food] is not Batel. All the more so water by itself is not Batel!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Water and salt are Batel in a dough, but they are not Batel in a pot, due to the gravy. (They are evident in it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (b) - Rava):</span> The case is, the barrel acquired Shevisah, but the water did not. (It was drawn from a river on Shabbos.) The barrel is Batel to the water.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Motzi a live person on a bed, he is exempt even for the bed, for it is Batel to the person; (He is exempt for the person because ha'Chai Nosei Es Atzmo. Rashi - living beings make themselves lighter. Tosfos - they did not carry living beings for the sake of the Mishkan.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one was Motzi less than a Shi'ur of food in a Kli, he is exempt even for the Kli, for it is Batel to the food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (and Contradiction to Mishnah - Rav Yosef - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> In a caravan, one may give a barrel to a friend, who gives it to a friend [...even to take it outside the Techum].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is permitted only in a caravan (Chachamim are lenient because water is scarce)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (and Resolution #1 of Contradiction - Rav Yosef):</span> Also the Mishnah discusses a caravan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Defense (of Answer #2, and Resolution #2 - Abaye):</span> The Beraisa permits in a caravan even if both the barrel and the water acquired Shevisah. The Mishnah permits not in a caravan [even] if the barrel acquired Shevisah, but [only if] the water did not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (and Resolution #3 - Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah discusses a barrel and water that are Hefker [not in a caravan]. The Chachamim [who argue with R. Yehudah] hold like R. Yochanan ben Nuri, who says that Hefker objects acquire Shevisah. (Tosfos - Chachamim who argue with R. Yochanan ben Nuri say that Hefker acquires the Techum of the one who acquires it. We must say that everyone who took the barrel intended to acquire only what he will drink.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [If they are Hefker,] what is the meaning of 'one may not take it past where <i>its owner</i> may go'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One may not take it further than things that have owners.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>RETRIEVING A SEFER THAT DROPPED ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was reading a Sefer [of rolled up parchment] on a porch and it became unraveled (he is holding one end, and the other end fell off the porch to the ground), he may roll it back to himself;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he was on the roof (Reshus ha'Yachid) and it became unraveled:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Before the end comes within 10 Tefachim of the ground (Reshus ha'Rabim), he may roll it back;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Once the end is within 10 Tefachim, [he may not roll it back. This is a decree lest he grab it when it fell totally from his hand. He would be Chayav for this! Rather,] he turns it over so the writing is not seen [lest Kisvei ha'Kodesh be disgraced].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, even if the end is a tiny amount above the ground, he may roll it back;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Shimon says, even if the end is on the ground, he may roll it back, for we do not enforce any Shevus (mid'Rabanan law) if this will cause disgrace to Kisvei ha'Kodesh.</p></div>
