<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Mishnah):</span> If Bnei Chatzer forgot to be Me'arev with Bnei Mirpeses, anything 10 Tefachim tall is to the Bnei Mirpeses. Anything less is to the Bnei Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We are thinking that the Bnei Mirpeses live in an Aliyah (a second story 10 Tefachim above the Mirpeses, which is 10 Tefachim above the ground). They are called Bnei Mirpeses because they get to their apartments via the Mirpeses;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(Anything 10 Tefachim above the ground is 10 below the Bnei Mirpeses.) The Bnei Chatzer can throw and the Bnei Mirpeses can lower, yet the Bnei Mirpeses are permitted [like Shmuel]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna answered [elsewhere], it is permitted to Bnei Mirpeses who live [in apartments whose openings are directly to] the Mirpeses. The same answer applies here. (They are only 10 above the ground. Anything this tall is convenient for them to use.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> Anything less is [permitted] to the Bnei Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is convenient for (i.e. less than 10 from) both of them. Both should be forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, it means that it is <i>also</i> [accessible] to the Bnei Chatzer, therefore it is forbidden to both.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> This is if these are near the Mirpeses. If they are far away, even if they are 10 tall, they are to the Bnei Chatzer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of 'they are to the Bnei Chatzer'?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot mean 'they are permitted to the Bnei Chatzer', for they are inconvenient for both of them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that they are <i>also</i> [accessible with difficulty] to the Bnei Chatzer, therefore they are forbidden to both.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Also in the Reisha it means that it is also to the Bnei Chatzer, therefore it is forbidden to both!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a rock or Chulyah of a pit is 10 Tefachim tall, it is permitted to the Bnei Mirpeses. If it is less, it is permitted to the Bnei Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>[We are thinking that the Bnei Mirpeses live on the second story. They can lower and the Bnei Chatzer can throw, yet the Bnei Mirpeses are permitted [like Shmuel]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> They are permitted to Bnei Mirpeses who live on the Mirpeses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This answers regarding a rock (it is convenient for Bnei Mirpeses). However, [people draw from the bottom of a pit;] even Bnei Mirpeses use a pit [with difficulty, i.e.] by lowering!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak brei d'Rav Yehudah):</span> The case is, it is full of water. (They draw from the top, which is within 10 of them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Once they draw some water, it is no longer full, and they use it by lowering!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it is permitted when it is full, it is permitted even when it is not full.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No! Since it is forbidden when it is not full, it should be forbidden even when it is full [lest people take the water]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Rather, it is full of produce.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Once some are removed, it is not full!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The produce is Tevel. (One may not move it on Shabbos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> The pit is taught together with a rock. (It does not get diminished.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Mishnah teach about a pit and a rock?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it taught only about a rock, which is never diminished, one might have thought that we decree to forbid a pit [even full of Tevel] due to a pit that can be diminished, e.g. it is full of Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>QUESTIONS AGAINST SHMUEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> If Bnei Chatzer forgot to be Me'arev [together] with Bnei Aliyah, the Bnei Chatzer may use the bottom 10 Tefachim of the wall [of the house facing the Chatzer]. The Bnei Aliyah may use the top 10 Tefachim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a ledge juts out from the wall below 10 Tefachim, the Bnei Chatzer may use it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is above [the height that is] 10 Tefachim [below the Aliyah], the Bnei Aliyah may use it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> (We are thinking that the Aliyah is more than 20 Tefachim tall.) If the ledge is in between (more than 10 Tefachim above the ground, and more than 10 Tefachim below the Aliyah), it is forbidden to both [even though the Bnei Chatzer use through throwing and the Bnei Aliyah by lowering. This is like Rav!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> No, the wall is only 19 tall. It is convenient for one and inconvenient for the other. (Indeed, the middle Tefach is convenient for both, so both are forbidden. Rashi - we do not establish it to be 20 tall, for then the above inference would apply to the exact middle.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">84b----------------------------------------84b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Mishnah):</span> [If a balcony is above water, if one makes a hole in the balcony and a Mechitzah 10 Tefachim above or below the balcony, he may draw water on Shabbos.] If two balconies are one above the other, and a Mechitzah was made only for the top one, both of them are forbidden unless they are Me'arev together. (The bottom one must throw [the bucket to the top balcony and lower it], and the upper one merely lowers, yet both are forbidden!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The case is, the people on bottom go up [a ladder] to the top balcony to draw water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The case is, the upper balcony is less than 10 above the lower one. The Mishnah teaches a bigger Chidush:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is a small Chidush to forbid both when a Mechitzah was made only for the bottom one. Since they are within 10 of each other, [they are like one Reshus, so] they forbid each other;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, this is even when a Mechitzah was made only for the top one. One might have thought that since it is convenient for them and inconvenient for the bottom one, we give it to the top ones. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This is like Rav Nachman taught;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> If a roof borders Reshus ha'Rabim, it is permitted only if there is a fixed ladder (Tosfos - from the Chatzer; Rashi - from a balcony) [to the roof];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A movable ladder is not enough. What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Because they are within 10 of each other, [they are like one Reshus,] they forbid each other;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 - Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps Rabim rest their hats and turbans on the roof [or balcony (Rashi). Even if it is above 10, it is convenient for light things, in particular things worn on the head!]</p></div>
