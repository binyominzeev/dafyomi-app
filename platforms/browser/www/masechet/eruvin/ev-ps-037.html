<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHICH TANA'IM HOLD EIN BREIRAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav should rather say that we learn from our Mishnah that Ayo's Beraisa is mistaken! (Mishnayos are more authoritative than Beraisos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We have another source that R. Yehudah holds Ein Breirah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Meir):</span> If one bought [100 Lugim of] wine from Kusim [and lacks Kelim into which to put the tithes], he says 'the two Lugim that I will separate later should be Terumah. Ten Lugim [that I will separate] are Ma'aser Rishon, and nine Lugim are Ma'aser Sheni.' He (Rashi - redeems the Ma'aser Sheni and) may drink immediately;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah, R. Yosi and R. Shimon forbid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Beraisa #1 teaches that Ayo's Beraisa is mistaken.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah holds Ein Breirah in Beraisa #1 (it supports Ayo)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Ula's text of Beraisa #1 puts R. Yehudah with R. Meir. I.e. R. Meir and R. Yehudah permit, and R. Yosi and R. Shimon forbid. (On Amud B we will give other answers to every question based on Beraisa #1.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi holds Yesh Breirah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> If each of two women are obligated to offer a Kan (Chatas ha'Of and Olas ha'Of) and they bought four birds together, or gave money together to a Kohen [to buy and offer four birds], the Kohen may offer any [two] birds for Chata'os and the others for Olos [one of each for each woman. We say retroactively that each bird offered for each woman belonged to her. This relies on Breirah!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> No, the case is, they stipulated [Ri - which bird belongs to each woman. The birds were never mixed up.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, this is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches Rav Chisda's law (Ri - and that we do not decree due to when they did not stipulate, for then Breirah would be required).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A Kan becomes specified (which is the Chatas and which is the Olah) only [by the owner] at the time he bought it, or [if he did not specify then, by the Kohen] when the Kohen offers it [even if the owner later tried to specify it].</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere, R. Yosi holds Yesh Breirah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> If [Reuven,] an Am ha'Aretz [who is not trustworthy about Ma'aser] asked a Chaver (Shimon) to buy an [extra] bundle of vegetables or bun for him [and Shimon bought for himself and Reuven from an Am ha'Aretz], Shimon need not tithe [what he gives to Reuven. We say that retroactively, what he gives to Reuven was never his. He was a mere Shali'ach to buy it for him. The others he bought for himself];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, he must tithe it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The opinions must be switched.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #2 - R. Yosi):</span> If one declares 'my Ma'aser is redeemed on the first coin that I will pull out of my wallet', it takes effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> It should say 'it does not take effect.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why switch two (that Mishnah and Beraisa) due to one (Beraisa #1)? It is better to switch one due to two!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely, Beraisa #2 must be switched!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa of Beraisa #2):</span> R. Yosi agrees that if one declares 'the Ma'aser in my house is redeemed on the new coin that I will pull out of my wallet', it is redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since here R. Yosi says 'it is redeemed', this implies that above he says that it is not redeemed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of a new coin?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there is more than one new coin in the wallet, this is just like the Reisha!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is only one new coin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say 'that I will pull out of my wallet'? (This does not affect the redemption!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is merely for consistency with the Reisha, which discusses pulling out a coin [among several coins].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DISTINCTIONS OF WHEN WE CAN APPLY YESH BREIRAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa, who holds that Ein Breirah even regarding mid'Rabanan laws?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven said to five people 'I will be Me'arev for whichever of you that I desire. The one I pick will go':</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he decided before Shabbos, the Eruv works [for that person]. If not, it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rav Nachman could not answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say that it is the Tana of Ayo's Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He had not heard the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Tana'im argue about this (whether or not Yesh Breirah):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'I will be Me'arev for every Shabbos of the year that I will want to go', if he decided before Shabbos, the Eruv is valid for that Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, [even] if he decided after dark it is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim say, in this case it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon contradicts himself. Elsewhere (Mishnah #1), he holds that Ein Breirah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The opinions in the Beraisa must be switched.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must we switch the opinions? Perhaps R. Shimon holds that Yesh Breirah for mid'Rabanan laws, but Ein Breirah for mid'Oraisa laws!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yosef holds that the Tana'im do not distinguish between mid'Oraisa and mid'Rabanan regarding Breirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to every question based on Beraisa #1):</span> Normally, they (R. Yehudah, R. Yosi and R. Shimon) hold that Yesh Breirah. Terumah is different, for "Reishis [Deganecha...]" teaches that the remnants after taking Reishis (Terumah) must be recognizable [at the time of separation].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, if one had two pomegranates of Tevel and said 'if it will rain today, this one should be Terumah on the other, and if not, vice-versa', will you say that nothing happens whether or not it rains?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Indeed, this is true!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If one said 'the Terumah for this pile is inside it, and the Ma'aseros are inside it, and Terumas Ma'aser is inside it, this takes effect [even though we do not know where they are].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, remnants are recognizable. The outside of the pile is Chulin! (He declared the tithes to be <i>inside.</i>)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to the questions based on Beraisa #1):</span> A Beraisa teaches that they agree that Yesh Breirah. (They forbid for a different reason):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah, R. Yosi and R. Shimon, to R. Meir):</span> Aren't you concerned lest the barrel break, and retroactively he drank Tevel [for he will never be able to separate the tithes]?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> Until it breaks, we are not concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Answer #2 (the remnants must be recognizable), how do we understand their challenge to R. Meir?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They say 'we say that the remnants must be recognizable, so this does not work at all;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even you should forbid, lest the barrel break, and he will have drunk Tevel retroactively!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir answered that until it breaks, we are not concerned.</p></div>
