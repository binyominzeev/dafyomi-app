<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHICH BOLTS MAY BE MOVED ON SHABBOS? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> If it [hangs and] can be taken by the rope [it is strong enough, i.e. it will not snap], all permit it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue in a case where it cannot be taken by the rope.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi holds that since it has a pestle at the end, it is considered a Kli. (Locking with it does not look like building);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Eliezer holds that since it cannot be taken by the rope, it is like a bolt that is not connected. (The coming Mishnah forbids this.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may lock with a 'dragging' bolt (this will be explained) in the Mikdash, but not outside the Mikdash. (Every leniency in the Mikdash is because Ein Shevus b'Mikdash, i.e. needs of Avodah override mid'Rabanan stringencies);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If it is [not tied, rather,] resting [on the ground] it is forbidden everywhere. (One who locks with it is liable for building);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if it is resting it is permitted in the Mikdash. If it drags it is permitted [even] outside the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the 'dragging' bolt permitted in the Mikdash and forbidden outside?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is tied to the wall, hangs down, and reaches the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yehudah):</span> This is permitted even outside the Mikdash!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> The bolt permitted only in the Mikdash is neither tied nor hanging; one removes it and leaves it [on the ground] in a corner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah regarding a bolt that [<i>hangs and</i>] drags.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is only if it is tied to the door [but not if it is tied to the doorpost. Then, it looks like building.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Tavla visited Mechuza (Rava's city) and saw a bolt hanging from the supporting beam of a door, and he did not say anything!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That bolt could be taken by the rope.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Rav Avya visited Neharda'a; he saw a man tying [a bolt to the door] with a reed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Avya:</span> You may not lock with it. (It is not considered tied, for the reed is too weak.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> What is the law of Nikmaz? (There is a hole in the ground behind the door for the bolt to enter to lock the door.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> Nishmat is forbidden. (The rope holding a bolt snapped, and one leaves the bolt in a corner when the door is unlocked.) Nikmaz is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, Nikmaz is forbidden even if it is not Nishmat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah regarding Nikmaz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It looks like building.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nechumi bar Zecharyah):</span> If one made a handle [in the middle of a bolt that is not tied], what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> With the handle it is like a pestle! (Surely, it is permitted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nechumi bar Ada):</span> If one made a handle [for a bolt], it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>There was a beam in R. Pedas' house that required 10 people to move it [due to its weight]. They put it next to the door [to support it at night]. He did not comment;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He permitted because it is considered a Kli.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>There was a mortar in Shmuel's house that contained 15 Sa'im (about 180 liters). He permitted people to put it next to the door, because it is considered a Kli.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ADDING TO A TEMPORARY OHEL ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Amram citing Rav Asi):</span> If arches on a boat [on which mats are spread to shield from rain and cold] are [each] a Tefach wide, or if they are within three Tefachim of each other, one may spread a mat over them [on Shabbos].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (They are already considered an Ohel. In the latter case, this is due to Lavud.) One may add to a temporary Ohel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rav Huna had rams that needed shade during the day and air at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav:</span> Just before Shabbos, do not remove the mat [spread over them during the day]. Rather, roll it up, and leave a Tefach spread, so on Shabbos day you may unroll it (adding to a temporary Ohel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may spread a curtain [for privacy] or Kilas Chasanim (a canopy over a bed with a pointed roof. See the diagram in Rashi) on Shabbos, or take it down.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes brei d'Rav Idi):</span> This is only if the roof is not a Tefach wide. If it is, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Even if the roof is not a Tefach wide, it is permitted only if it is not a Tefach wide within three Tefachim of the roof. If it is, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Even if it is not a Tefach wide within three, it is permitted only if the Shipu'a (horizontal component of the slope) is less than a Tefach. If it is a Tefach, Shipu'a [of a slanted] Ohel is considered like a [horizontal] Ohel, so it is forbidden. (Rashi - surely, the bed is at least two Tefachim wide, so the Shipu'a on each side is at least a Tefach! We must say that if the canopy rests on several lengthwise poles; it is permitted if the Shipu'a between any two poles is less than a Tefach - see Perush Chai diagram, Perek 10 number 92, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-10chai092.jpg>English Charts</a> section.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">102b----------------------------------------102b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> One may wear a felt hat on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It was taught that it is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (#1):</span> It is forbidden [due to an Ohel] only if it spreads out a Tefach from his head.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Is it forbidden to spread a Talis over his head if it sticks out a Tefach?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer #2:</span> Rather, it is permitted only if it is taut on his head. (A strap holds it in place. If not, it is forbidden lest it blow off and he will carry it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Chananel) Answer:</span> A hat is taut. (it does not bend, so it looks like an Ohel). A Talis is not taut.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>RETURNING A DOOR ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the lower hinge-pin [of a door [or window] of a Kli] came out, in the Mikdash one may return it [on Shabbos, for it is easy to return it], but not outside the Mikdash [lest he bang it in, and be liable for finishing a Kli];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the upper hinge-pin came out, it is forbidden everywhere. (Rashi - even if the lower pin is intact, the door will fall off, so attaching the upper pin is building. This Tana holds that building applies to Kelim. Tosfos - he forbids lest one bang it back. This is a severe Shevus that is not permitted in the Mikdash.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, [even] the upper pin [is permitted] in the Mikdash (building does not apply to Kelim), and [only] the lower pin [is permitted] outside the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> In the Mikdash one may return the [lower] pin of a door of a coach, box or cabinet. Outside the Mikdash, [if it did not totally leave the hole in which it rotates] one may push it back;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The upper pin is forbidden everywhere. This (Tosfos; Rashi - the Isur to return a lower pin outside the Mikdash) is a decree lest one bang it back. If one did so, he is Chayav Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>One may not return a pin of a door of a pit, [underground] cistern or of an extension of a building. If one did so, he is Chayav Chatas [for building onto something attached to the ground].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>RETURNING A BANDAGE ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In the Mikdash, one [a Kohen] may return a bandage [on Shabbos, i.e. if he removed it to do Avodah];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is forbidden outside the Mikdash [lest he smear, which is a Melachah];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>In any place one may not put on a bandage for the first time. (This is never needed for Avodah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If a bandage fell off a wound, we may return it on Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, [if it fell we may not return it, but] if it slipped below, one may force it back up, and vice-versa;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>One may partially pull back a bandage to clean [part of] the wound, then pull back the other part to clean [the rest of] the wound;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may not clean the bandage, for this is smearing. If he smeared, he is Chayav Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> They only argue about when it fell onto a Kli. If it fell on the ground, all forbid returning it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Mar bar Rav Ashi:</span> I saw a bandage fall from my father onto a pillow, and he returned it on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Mar bar Rav Ashi:</span> Rav Chisda taught that the argument is when it fell onto a Kli, and Rav Yehudah said that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah [who forbids]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> I disagree with him (Rav Chisda. I hold that they argue about when it fell on the ground, but if it fell on a Kli, all permit returning it.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>FIXING A STRING OF A HARP ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [On Shabbos] one may tie a string [of a harp that broke] in the Mikdash, but not outside the Mikdash;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>In any place one may not tie it for the first time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If a string of a harp broke, one may not make a knot, but one may make a bow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #1:</span> Our Mishnah is R. Eliezer, and the Beraisa is Chachamim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer holds that [if a Mitzvah overrides Shabbos, also its] Machshirim (necessary preparations) override Shabbos, so he permits to tie it;</p></div>
