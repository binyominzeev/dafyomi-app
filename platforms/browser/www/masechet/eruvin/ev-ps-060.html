<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ARE LADDERS MEVATEL MECHITZOS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Nachman taught that if Bnei Mirpeses [they live in an upper story. They have a balcony with a ladder, through which they descend to the Chatzer and from there to Reshus ha'Rabim] forgot to be Me'arev with the Bnei Chatzer, they forbid only if there is no Dakah four Tefachim [tall - Rashi; Rambam - four wide and 10 tall], in front of the ladder]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the Mirpeses is not 10 tall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does a Dakah permit? (This is like two Chatzeros without a wall between them!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, a Mechitzah surrounds the entire Mirpeses, except for 10 Amos. The Dakah shows that they withdraw from the Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> If ladders were erected next to each other against a wall, even if the total width is more than 10 Amos, it is still considered a wall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Berona):</span> Shmuel does not hold that a ladder is a Mechitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> If Bnei Mirpeses forgot to be Me'arev with the Bnei Chatzer, they forbid only if there is no Dakah four Tefachim in front [of the ladder].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He discusses a Mirpeses less than 10 tall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does a Dakah permit?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, a Mechitzah surrounds the entire Mirpeses, except for 10 Amos. The Dakah shows that they withdraw from the Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT IS A VALID REMNANT?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>People of a certain [public city that became an individual's] city asked Rav Yosef to send someone to be Me'arev their city. He told Abaye 'go be Me'arev in a way that will not arouse complaints.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Abaye saw houses that were open to a river [and not to the city]. He decided that they will be the remnant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah says that we may not be Me'arev all of it. This implies that [if not for the decree] one could be Me'arev the remnant with it! (Therefore, these houses cannot be the remnant.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Abaye decided to make windows [in the wall between these houses and the city], so that they could choose to be Me'arev with the city. Then, they would be a Kosher remnant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (Abaye):</span> This is not necessary. Rabah bar Avuha was Me'arev all of Mechuza, each neighborhood by itself, for they were separated by ditches in which date pits were stored for animals;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Each neighborhood was a remnant for the others, even though they could not Me'arev together!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (Abaye):</span> I cannot learn from there. In Mechuza, they could have been Me'arev together through the roofs. Here, they could not, so windows are required.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (Abaye):</span> Windows are not required. A certain man in Pumbadisa had a storage area for straw, and Chachamim made it the remnant for the city (Tosfos - together with three Chatzeros, like R. Shimon. Rashi, according to Sefas Emes - since Abaye inferred that we do not require that even part of the remnant could be Me'arev with the city, we must say that the Chatzeros were in the storage area.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> This is why Rav Yosef warned me to be careful!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We must leave a remnant as big as the city 'Chadashah'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> There was a city in Yehudah called 'Chadashah'. It had 50 residents, including men, women and children. Chachamim made this the standard remnant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one was Me'arev Chadashah, does it require a remnant?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! Just like it is a remnant for the big city (they were not Me'arev together), the big city is a remnant for it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if we are Me'arev a city the size of Chadashah, does it require a remnant?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna or Rav Yehudah):</span> It requires a remnant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Huna and Rav Yehudah):</span> It does not require a remnant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> One must leave over three Chatzeros, each with at least two houses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chama bar Gurya):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Even one house and one Chatzer suffice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be! (We require three Chatzeros.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, it suffices if one house opens to each Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Did R. Yitzchak have a tradition for this, or is this his reasoning?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> What difference does it make?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Is learning merely a song [that one recites for pleasure, and need not understand all the words]?</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AN ERUV MUST BE OUTSIDE THE IBUR BUT INSIDE THE TECHUM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was in the east and told his son to be Me'arev for him in the west, or vice-versa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he is within 2000 Amos of his house and more than 2000 Amos from his Eruv, he is permitted to [go to] house and forbidden to [go to] his Eruv;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he is within 2000 Amos of his Eruv and more than 2000 Amos from his house, he is permitted to his Eruv and forbidden to his house. (This will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one put an Eruv in the Ibur of the city, it has no effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one put an Eruv outside the Techum, even one Amah outside, whatever he gains [in that direction] he loses [in the opposite direction].</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Assumption:</span> The Mishnah means [that Reuven was] to the east of his house [and told his son to be Me'arev in the west], or [vice-versa, i.e. Reuven was] to the west of his house [and told his son to be Me'arev in the east].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand how he can be within 2000 of his house and more than 2000 from his Eruv, i.e. when he walks 2000 Amos [west], he reaches his house but does not reach his Eruv;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, how can he be within 2000 Amos of his Eruv and more than 2000 Amos from his house?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak):</span> Your assumption is wrong. The Mishnah discusses [Reuven being] east of his son and [in the vice-versa case] west of his son.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava bar Rav Shila):</span> Really, it refers to east and west of his house. The case is, his house is on a diagonal (like the diagram in Rashi, illustrating the vice-versa case. He is southwest of his house, and due west of his Eruv. His Eruv is [far to the south and just a bit] east of his house).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one put an Eruv in the Ibur...[if it is outside the Techum...]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, it is not outside the Techum! (Such an Eruv is invalid.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, it means if it is outside the Ibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Whatever he gains he loses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He loses more than he gains!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one put an Eruv in the Ibur of the city, it has no effect;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he put it outside the Ibur [e.g. to the east], even one Amah outside, he gains that Amah [to the east], but [to the west] he loses [it and the width of] the entire city. [Beforehand, the entire city counted like only four Amos. Now,] its true measure is deducted from the 2000 Amos that he may go [to the west].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses when his 2000 Amos extend pass the city. The Beraisa discusses when his 2000 Amos end in the city:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Idi citing R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If Reuven [lodged outside a city, and] counted his steps and found that his 2000 Amos end in the middle of the city, he may go only up to there;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If his 2000 Amos contain the end of the city, the entire city counts like only four Amos, and he counts the rest of his 2000 Amos past the city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Idi):</span> These are like words of prophecy [without rational explanation]! What is the difference whether his 2000 Amos extend pass the city, or end in the city?!</p></div>
