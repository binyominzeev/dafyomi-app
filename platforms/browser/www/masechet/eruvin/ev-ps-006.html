<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A PIRTZAH IN A MAVOY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chanin bar Rava):</span> A Mavoy can have a Pirtzah of up to 10 Amos in its side [if four Tefachim remain near the opening], and [if the opening was too wide and was diminished by a wall] up to [but not including] four Tefachim in its 'head' (that wall).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, it can have a Pirtzah of up to 10 Amos in the side, because this is like a doorway. The same should apply to its head!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> The Pirtzah in the head is actually in the corner. People do not make doorways in the corner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> It cannot have a Pirtzah more than four Tefachim in either place.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Huna (to Rav Chanin bar Rava):</span> Do not argue with me. Rav visited a certain place, and ruled about a particular Mavoy like me!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rebuttal (Rav Chanin):</span> Rav saw a need to be stringent beyond the letter of the law.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> Presumably, Rav Huna is correct:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> [The Tikun for] a bent Mavoy (like the picture in Rashi) is like [that for] a Mavoy Mefulash (it is straight and open on both ends. The latter needs a Lechi or Korah on one end, and Tzuras ha'Pesach on the other. A bent Mavoy is like two Mavo'os Mefulashim, for we consider each to be open at the bend (where they meet) to Reshus ha'Rabim. Therefore, we require Tzuras ha'Pesach at the bend, and Lechi or Korah at each opening to Reshus ha'Rabim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A bent Mavoy is like a Mavoy Sasum (closed on three sides. Therefore, a bent Mavoy needs only Lechi or Korah on each opening (Rashi). Rashi's Rebbi requires also a Lechi or Korah at the bend).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the width [at the bend] is more than 10 Amos, Shmuel would not consider it like a Mavoy Sasum! (Surely, it is like one long Mavoy open to Reshus ha'Rabim on both ends, i.e. Mefulash. Alternatively, he would not say that a Lechi at the bend permits, for a Lechi does not permit an opening more than 10 Amos. According to Tosfos (DH v'Lechi), who holds that a Lechi permits if its thickness diminishes the gap to at most 10, the difficulty is that Shmuel did not specify how thick the Lechi must be.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The width is at most 10, and Rav considers it Mefulash. [Since he does not require more than 10, surely] he considers [even] four Tefachim to be a Pirtzah on the side!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chanin bar Rava):</span> The Pirtzah for a bent Mavoy is smaller, because many people go through it (each end opens to Reshus ha'Rabim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Rav Huna holds that the Pirtzah cannot exceed four Tefachim [even for a regular Mavoy,] even if many people do not go through it (e.g. it opens to a muddy area).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than the law of R. Ami and R. Asi (if part of a side wall was broken, and four Tefachim of the wall remain by the opening, it permits a Pirtzah up to 10 Amos)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, even where it was breached, three or four Tefachim of the wall remain [at the bottom]. Rav Huna does not allow a breach of four Tefachim when nothing remains.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HOW TO BE ME'AREV A RESHUS HA'RABIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1) Question:</span> How can we Me'arev (permit carrying in) a Reshus ha'Rabim [with walls on two sides? Normally, 'Me'arev' means to put food jointly owned by members of a Chatzer in one of the houses to permit carrying in the Chatzer.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> One makes Tzuras ha'Pesach [across Reshus ha'Rabim] on one side, and Lechi or Korah on the other side. (<a href=ev-ps-appendix.htm#1>See note 1 in Appendix</a>.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chananyah):</span> Beis Shamai requires a door on each side, and to lock it when going in or out;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Hillel requires a door on one side, and a Lechi or Korah on the other side.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one really Me'arev Reshus ha'Rabim like this [according to Chachamim]?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> R. Yehudah said an even bigger Chidush. If one owns two houses on opposite sides of Reshus ha'Rabim, he puts a Lechi on each side [of one house, near it] or a Korah on each side, and he may carry in the middle. (He holds that two walls make a Reshus ha'Yachid mid'Oraisa. The Lechayayim are needed to permit carrying even mid'Rabanan. Neither Tana of Beraisa #1 holds like R. Yehudah. Both of them require a door or Tzuras ha'Pesach);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We cannot be Me'arev Reshus ha'Rabim like this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim say that we cannot be Me'arev <i>like this</i>, but we can be Me'arev with a door [on one side, even if it is not locked, like Beis Hillel]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Had they not locked the doors of Yerushalayim at night, it would have been Reshus ha'Rabim, and one who carried in it would have been liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If they didn't lock the doors of the Mavo'os Mefulashim of Mechuza at night, they would be Reshus ha'Rabim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Beraisa asks, how are we Me'arev Mavo'os Mefulashim? One makes Tzuras ha'Pesach on one side, and Lechi or Korah (some texts - Lechi and Korah) on the other side...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Halachah follows the first Tana.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Beis Hillel according to Chananyah, must one lock the door?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer  (Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> One need not lock it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rav Masnah said similarly in the name of Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Masnah):</span> A case occurred, and Shmuel told me that one need not lock it. (end of Version #2)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Anan):</span> The [doors of the] Mavo'os Mefulashim are half-covered in dirt (they cannot be closed), yet Shmuel walks through and does not comment!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Kahana):</span> Those doors were only slightly open.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav Nachman commanded to clear the dirt away from the doors [to enable closing them].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Nachman holds that the doors must be closed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he requires only that it is possible to close them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>There was a bent Mavoy in Neharda'a (both ends opened to Reshus ha'Rabim in the same direction, like Rashi's picture). They applied to it the stringencies of Rav and Shmuel, and required doors [at both bends]</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They were stringent like Rav, who considers it like a Mavoy Mefulash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav says that the Halachah follows the first Tana (who says that Tzuras ha'Pesach and Lechi or Korah suffice to be Me'arev Reshus ha'Rabim. He never requires doors)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They required doors like Shmuel, who rules like Chananyah.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One should not follow both stringencies!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Halachah always follows Beis Hillel; one may choose to follow Beis Shamai, or Beis Hillel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one follows the leniencies of both, he is wicked;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It says about one who follows the stringencies of both [when they are inconsistent] "veha'Kesil ba'Choshech Yelech"(a fool walks in darkness).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rather, one should consistently follow Beis Shamai, or consistently follow Beis Hillel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa contradicts itself!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>First it says that the Halachah always follows Beis Hillel - then it says that one may choose to follow Beis Shamai!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Before the Bas Kol (voice from Heaven) announced that the Halachah follows Beis Hillel, one could choose to follow Beis Shamai; after the Bas Kol, the Halachah follows Beis Hillel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The entire Beraisa is after the Bas Kol.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana says that we heed a Bas Kol; the second Tana is R. Yehoshua, who does not heed a Bas Kol.</p></div>
