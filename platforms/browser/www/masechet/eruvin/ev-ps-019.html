<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE ENTRANCE TO GEHINOM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah ben Elazar):</span> Hash-m's ways are unlike the ways of people. When a mortal king executes someone, they prop his mouth open to prevent him from cursing the king;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When Hash-m takes a person's life, the person is quiet (he knows that he was judged properly, and he fears more punishment in Gehinom) -- "Lecha <i>Dumiyah</i> Sehilah";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Moreover, he praises Hash-m -- "Sehilah";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Moreover, he accepts afflictions and considers them like a Korban to Hash-m - "u'Lecha Yeshulam Neder".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is like R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> What is the meaning of "Ovrei b'Emek ha'Bacha Mayan Yeshisuhu Gam Berachos Yateh Moreh"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ovrei" refers to people who transgress Hash-m's will. "B'Emek' - Gehinom is made deep for them. "Ha'Bacha" - they cry, and their tears drip like a Mayan (spring) of Shitin (a conduit descending from the Mizbe'ach to the depths);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Gam Berachos Yateh Moreh" - they justify their judgment, saying that Hash-m properly vindicated or obligated them, and that it was good that He prepared Gehinom for Resha'im and Gan Eden for Tzadikim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reish Lakish taught that Resha'im do not repent even at the entrance of Gehinom!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Va'Yotz'u v'Ra'u b'Figrei ha'Anashim <i>ha'Posh'im</i> Bi"- it does not say that they <i>sinned</i>, rather, that they [continue to] sin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to Nochri sinners, but sinners of Yisrael repent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> If we would not say so, Reish Lakish would contradict himself!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> A Kal va'Chomer from the golden Mizbe'ach teaches that the fire of Gehinom does not rule over sinners of Yisrael:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The golden Mizbe'ach is plated with the mere thickness of a gold Dinar, yet the fire of [coals that burn Ketores every day for] so many years never harmed it (the wood underneath - Tosfos (Chagigah); Rashi - the gold);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Sinners of Yisrael are full of Mitzvos like a pomegranate [is full of seeds] - "k'Felach ha'Rimon Rakasech." All the more so the fire of Gehinom does not rule over them!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> We read "Rakasech" like 'Reikasayich'. Even Reikim (empty Yisraelim) are full of Mitzvos like a pomegranate.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Ovrei b'Emek ha'Bacha"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Those sentenced go briefly to Gehinom, and Avraham takes them out, except for a Yisrael who had relations with a Nochris. The foreskin of such a man stretches, and he does not appear like a Yisrael to Avraham. (Nevertheless, the <i>possibility</i> of even a brief time in Gehinom terrified R. Yochanan ben Zakai (Berachos 28b).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Kahana):</span> If "ha'Posh'im" means sinners who still sin, we should also say that "ha'Motzi [Eschem me'Eretz Mitzrayim]" and "ha'Ma'aleh [Eschem...]" are still happening! (Rashi; Maharsha - we cite "ha'Motzi Lecha Mayim mi'Tzur ha'Chalamish" (Devarim 8:15). Some say that 'ha'Motzi' (Shemos 6:7) regarding Yetzi'as Miztrayim refers to the future (Berachos 38a).)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it means that He was Motzi. Likewise, "ha'Posh'im" means people who sinned [while alive]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah ben Elazar):</span> There are three openings to Gehinom:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is one in the Midbar [that swallowed the families of Korach, Dasan and Aviram] -- "va'Yerdu... Chayim She'olah";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>There is one in the sea [where Yonah was] -- "mi'Beten She'ol Shivati";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>There is one in Yerushalayim -- "Ne'um Hash-m Asher Ur Lo b'Tziyon... ";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'vei R. Yishmael - Beraisa):</span> "Asher Ur Lo b'Tziyon" is Gehinom. "V'Sanur Lo bi'Yrushalayim" is the opening to Gehinom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are more openings to Gehinom!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meryon):</span> There are two date trees in Gei (the valley of) Ven Hinom. Smoke comes from between them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We learned that [Lulavim of] <i>Tzinei Har ha'Barzel</i> are Kesherim. This refers to these two trees.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is the opening to Gehinom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps that is the opening in Yerushalayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Gehinom has seven names - She'ol, Avadon, Be'er Shachas, Bor Sha'on, Tit ha'Yaven, Tzalmaves and Eretz ha'Tachtis. (Maharshal - this is to instill Yir'as Shamayim in people);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn [six] from the following verses - "mi'Beten She'ol Shivati", "ha'Yesupar ba'Kever Chasdecha Emunascha ba'Avadon", "Ki Lo Sa'azov Nafshi li'Sh'ol Lo Siten Chasidcha Lir'os Shachas", "va'Ya'aleni mi'Bor Sha'on mi'Tit ha'Yaven", and "Yoshvei Choshech v'Tzalmaves";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We have a tradition for Eretz ha'Tachtis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are more names, e.g. Gehinom! (Yehoshua 18:16 mentions "Gei Hinom."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is not its name. It merely means the Gei (valley) as deep as Ven Hinom (mentioned in the same verse). Also, people go there due to Chinam (Maharsha - Arayos. Relatives agree to have relations for free, without a Kesuvah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is also called Tafteh - "Ki Aruch me'Esmol Tafteh"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [That is not its name.] It means that anyone who is Mispateh (seduced by his Yetzer ha'Ra) falls there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If Gan Eden is in Eretz Yisrael, the opening is Beis Sha'an. (It has the nicest fruits.) If it is in Araviya, the opening is Beis Garem. If it is between the mountains, its opening is Dumaskanin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>In Bavel, Abaye praised the fruits from the other side of the Peras river. Rava praised the fruits of Herpanya.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE DISTANCE BETWEEN PASIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The distance between them [is the width of two teams of bulls... the bulls in each team are tied. They are not loose.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously, if they are tied they are not loose!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that they are [close] as if they are tied, but they are not truly tied. 'They are not loose' teaches that they are truly tied.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One enters at the same time that the other leaves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This means that one <i>team</i> enters at the same time that the other leaves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> How much is Rosho v'Rubo of a cow? (The Mishnah requires this much room between the Pasim and the well.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is two Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the width of a cow?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Meir):</span> It is one and two thirds Amos, [so the maximum distance between Pasim is six times as much,] about 10 Amos;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> [The maximum distance is eight cow widths,] about 13 or 14 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Meir say <i>about</i> 10 Amos? It is exactly 10!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is due to R. Yehudah, who says about 13.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is more than 13! (It is 13 and a third.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is why he says 'or 14.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is less than 14!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It is more than 13 and less than 14.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> All agree that straight Pasim [on the sides, between the corner-posts] are not needed for a pit that is eight [Amos by eight Amos. We need two Amos on each side of the pit for Rosho v'Rubo, in all 12 by 12 Amos. The corner posts are [at least] an Amah in each direction, so at most 10 Amos separate the corner posts];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All require straight Pasim for a pit 12 [by 12. There are two more Amos on each side, so in all it is 16 by 16], so the gap between corner posts is 14. (Likewise, if the pit exceeds 11 and a third, the gap exceeds 13 and a third. Rav Papa discusses only whole numbers. Presumably, Rav Papa holds that it does not help to make the corner posts wider; see Abaye's question below. Alternatively, he discusses the need for extra Pasim when the corner posts have minimal width - <b>PF</b>.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They argue about a pit between eight and 12.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learn this from the Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Papa taught the Beraisa's law because he did not hear the Beraisa.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> According to R. Meir, if one made the Deyumadim wider to diminish the gap to 10, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rabah - Mishnah):</span> One may distance as much as desired, on condition that he is Marbeh (increases) b'Pasim.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it means that he makes additional [straight] Pasim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should have said 'he is Marbeh Pasim.' Marbeh <i>b</i>'Pasim connotes that he makes the Pasim bigger!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Beraisa should say 'he is Marbeh Pasim'.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> It can be up to Beis Sa'atayim, but no more.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Don't you agree that there is no limit for a Dir or Sahar (places where animals graze. They are considered Hukaf l'Dirah, for the shepherd stays there at night) or Rechavah or Chatzer!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> Those are different, for a [proper] Mechitzah surrounds them. Mere Pasim surround the well.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> If he held that we add to the width of the Deyumadim, also they would be [proper] Mechitzos (to surround Beis Sa'atayim!

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He means that the Halachos of Mechitzah apply to a Dir [or Sahar...], so it cannot have a gap more than 10 Amos.
