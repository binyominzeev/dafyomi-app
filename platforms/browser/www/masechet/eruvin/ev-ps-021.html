<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yitzchak taught that Pasei Bira'os were permitted only for a well of flowing water. If it is for animals, we do not care if the water is collected or flowing! (Tosfos 18a DH Bor - if the only concern is lest the water run out, a public pit should be permitted!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Even though it was enacted for the sake of animals,] we require [good] water appropriate for people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Above, we answered for Rav Yitzchak that Pasei Bira'os were permitted only for animals, but a person can climb down to drink, and climb out;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the well is too wide (one cannot spread his limbs from one side to the other and climb down), it is permitted [to draw water] even for people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> On Shabbos, one may not fill [a Kli] with water and put it in front of his animal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He may fill [a Kli] and pour it for his animal to drink by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Anan):</span> If so, Pasei Bira'os do not help!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, they permit to draw water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction - Question:</span> Rather, it does not help that there is room for Rosho v'Rubo of a cow!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa discusses a feeding trough four wide and 10 tall in Reshus ha'Rabim, and one end enters between the Pasim... (In a normal case, if Rosho v'Rubo are inside he may hold the Kli.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yirmeyah bar Aba citing Rav):</span> (Shacks of watchmen near a city are considered part of the city regarding Techumim.) The law of shacks does not apply in Bavel. Pasei Bira'os do not apply in [the rest of] Chutz la'Aretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shacks do not apply in Bavel, because floods are common. (The shacks are prone to be destroyed, so they are not significant);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Pasei Bira'os do not apply in Chutz la'Aretz, for [they permit only for Olei Regalim or people traveling to another Mitzvah, and] Yeshivos are scarce in Chutz la'Aretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Shacks do apply in Chutz la'Aretz [except for Bavel], and Pasei Bira'os do apply in Bavel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Yirmeyah bar Aba citing Rav):</span> Shacks and Pasei Bira'os do not apply in Bavel or Chutz la'Aretz;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shacks do not apply in Bavel, due to floods. They do not apply in Chutz la'Aretz, [for they are not significant] due to thieves;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Pasei Bira'os do not apply in Bavel, for water is plentiful. They do not apply in Chutz la'Aretz, for Yeshivos are scarce.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda (to the grandson on R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> I heard that you go on Shabbos from Barnish to the Beis ha'Keneses where Daniel prayed. This is three Parsa'os, more than one may leave the Techum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>You must rely on shacks. Your grandfather said in the name of Rav that shacks do not apply in Bavel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>R. Yirmeyah's grandson showed him destroyed cities within 70 Amos and a fraction [of Barnish, and of each other. Remaining walls of houses extend the Techum like shacks in Eretz Yisrael.]</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DIVREI TORAH AND DIVREI CHACHAMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda) Question:</span> How do we explain "l'Chol Tichleh Ra'isi Ketz Rechavah Mitzvascha Me'od" (I found a limit for everything, except for Torah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> David, Iyov and Yechezkeil were all overwhelmed by the vastness of Torah. No one specified [the measure] until Zecharyah did:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>David said the above verse [of Tehilim]. Iyov said "Aruchah me'Eretz Midah u' Rechavah Mini Yam". Yechezkeil said (Rashi - regarding the oral Torah) "va'Yifros Osah Lefanai v'Hi Chesuvah Panim v'Achor v'Chasuv Eleha Kinim ve'Hegeh va'Hi";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Kinim" refers to punishments of Tzadikim in this world - "Kinah Hi v'Konenuha." (This verse discusses Resha'im. It teaches only that Kinim refers to punishments);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>"Ve'Hegeh" refers to the reward of Tzadikim in the future - "Alei Higayon b'Chinor";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>"Va'Hi" refers to punishments of Resha'im in the world to come - "Hovah Al Hovah Tavo."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Zecharyah gave a measure - "... Ani Ro'eh Megilah Afah Arkah Esrim ba'Amah v'Rachbah Eser ba'Amah." (This refers to Hash-m's Amah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">("Afah:</span> means folded.) When it is unfolded, it is 20 by 20 Amos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>It was written "Panim v'Achor" (on both sides) - if one would peel off the two sides of the parchment and join them to make a scroll written on one side, it would be 40 by 20 Amos (four times its apparent size. This corresponds to four levels of expounding Torah - simple meaning, Drashah, allusion, and deep secret - Maharsha.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>It says "Mi Modad b'Sha'alo Mayim v'Shamayim ba'Zeres Tiken." (The world corresponds to Hash-m's Zeres (half an Amah - <a href=ev-ps-appendix.htm#13>see note 13 in Appendix</a>), so twice the size of the world corresponds to His Amah.) This teaches that the Torah is [80 times as long and 40 times as wide, i.e.] 3,200 times the size of the world.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda) Question:</span> How do we explain "V'Hinei Shnei Duda'ei Se'enim...; Ha'Dud Echad Te'enim Tovos Me'od... veha'Dud Echad Te'enim Ra'os Me'od..."?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The good figs are absolute Tzadikim, and the bad figs are absolute Resha'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> There is no hope for the Resha'im!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ha'Duda'im Nasnu Rei'ach" - in the future, both of them will have a nice scent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava) Question:</span> How do we explain "ha'Duda'im Nosnu Rei'ach"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to male youths of Yisrael who never sinned;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Al Pesacheinu Kol Megadim" refers to Benos Yisrael who are Magid Pischeihem (tell when they became Nidah) to their husbands. Alternatively, they are OGDos Pischeihem. (They bind their [genital] openings, and do not have relations with anyone except for their husbands.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Chadoshim Gam Yeshanim Dodi Tzafanti Lach" -- Keneses Yisrael says to Hash-m ''I decreed many stringencies on myself, more than You did, and I fulfilled them.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>A Talmid was reciting Agados in front of Rav Chisda. Rav Chisda asked him if heard anything about "Chadashim Gam Yeshanim."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">The Talmid:</span> These refer to light Mitzvos and severe Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Chisda):</span> The Torah was given all at once! (Why should some be called new, and some old?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Rather, Chadashim refers to mid'Rabanan laws, and Yeshanim refers to Torah laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava) Question:</span> What is the meaning of "v'Yoser me'Hemah Beni Hizaher Asos Seforim Harbeh"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One should be more careful about mid'Rabanan laws than mid'Oraisa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Most mid'Oraisa Mitzvos are Mitzvos Aseh or Lavim [without Misah]. However, anyone who transgresses mid'Rabanan laws is Chayav Misah [b'Yedei Shamayim -- "u'Foretz Gader Yishchenu Nachash"]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If mid'Rabanan laws are proper, why weren't they written in the Torah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Asos Seforim Harbeh Ein Ketz." (It would be too long.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa brei d'Rav Acha):</span> "V'Lahag Harbeh Yegi'as Basar" teaches that anyone who is MaL'iG (mocks) words of Chachamim is judged in boiling excrement [in Gehinom].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> "V'Lahag" is written with 'Hei'. It is unreasonable to expound from this (Tosfos R. Peretz - only) 'MaL'iG', which has an 'Ayin'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it [also] teaches that anyone who is Hogeh (ponders) Divrei Torah finds Ta'am (reason in them, like meat has Ta'am (taste)).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which R. Akiva was imprisoned [for teaching Torah]. Every day R. Yehoshua ha'Garsi used to bring to him a [meager] ration of water. One day, the warden claimed that he brought more water. He charged that this was to dig a tunnel [to escape], so he spilled out half of it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva saw the half ration, and said 'I am old. (This was near the end of his life. He was almost 120.) My life depends on what you bring to me!' R. Yehoshua explained what happened.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> 'Give the water to me, to wash before eating.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> There is not enough to drink. Will you use it to wash?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> One who transgresses Divrei Chachamim is Chayav Misah. It is better that I die my 'own' death [from thirst] than to transgress their words!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Akiva did not eat until washing. When Chachamim heard about this, they said 'if he was so [steadfast to follow Divrei Chachamim] in his old age, all the more so in his youth [when he had more strength to bear afflictions]! If he was so in prison, all the more so outside of prison!' (Tosfos - soldiers are exempt from washing, and all the more so someone in danger is exempt. R. Akiva was stringent on himself.)</p></div>
