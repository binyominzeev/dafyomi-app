<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> We distinguish Shevus with an action from Shevus without an action;</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>USING AN OTZAR FOR SHITUF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah bar Rav Chanin:</span> Why was no Eruv or Shituf placed in a Mavoy with two great Chachamim (Rabah and yourself)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> It is beneath the dignity of Rabah (the Rosh Yeshiva) to collect for the Eruv. I cannot, for it would disrupt my Girsa. (Even bringing a dip would disrupt Abaye (65a). R. Yehonason - it would take the entire day); no one else bothered to collect;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If I would be Mezakeh to them (make them partners in) my bread, it would be invalid, since if they would request bread [every week], I would not be prepared to give them! (<a href=ev-ps-appendix.htm#23>See note 23 in Appendix</a>.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a member of the Mavoy requested wine or oil of the Shituf and was denied, the Shituf is Batel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Rav Chanin):</span> Why didn't you Mezakeh to them a Revi'is (Rashba - in all; R. Yehonason - for each person in the Mavoy; Me'iri - the amount needed for two meals. Perhaps this is less than a Revi'is) of your vinegar in a barrel [in the Chatzer, for Shituf? Surely, you would grant a request for vinegar!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye - Beraisa #1):</span> One may not use an Otzar (stored food) for Shituf. (Rashi - this is because Ein Breirah. <a href=ev-ps-appendix.htm#24>See note 24 in Appendix for a fuller explanation and other Shitos</a>.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> One may use an Otzar for Shituf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution (Rav Oshaya):</span> Beraisa #1 is Beis Shamai, and Beraisa #2 is Beis Hillel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Mes was in a house with many openings (all are closed), every opening is Tamei. (It is Metamei things under the lintel);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one of them was opened, it is Tamei, and the others are Tehorim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If one intended to remove the Mes through one of them or through a window that is at least four by four [Tefachim], this is Metaher the other openings;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Beis Shamai say, this is only if he intended to do so before the person died. (If not, all are Temei'im until an action is done to open one of them);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, this is even if he intended after the person died. (Rashi - Yesh Breirah, so it is as if he intended for this opening from the beginning. <a href=ev-ps-appendix.htm#25>See note 25 in Appendix</a>.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE ARGUMENT OF RAV AND SHMUEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A case occurred in which the hot water prepared for a baby [to be circumcised] spilled. Rava told people to ask the mother if she would like hot water [to drink]. If she does, they may ask a Nochri to heat for her and the baby (Rashi. <a href=ev-ps-appendix.htm#26>See note 26 in Appendix</a>).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Mesharshiya:</span> She is eating dates! (Surely, just like she does not need hot food, she does not need hot water. Rashi Kidushin 30b - sick people do not eat sweet things.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Perhaps her mind is dazed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A case occurred in which the hot water prepared for a baby spilled. (Rava had hot water in his Chatzer, which opened to the Chatzer in which the baby was. There was no Eruv between them.) Rava said that he will be Mevatel his Chatzer, allowing others to take the water to the Chatzer of the baby. First he commanded to move his things from an [outer] room of his house which opened to his Chatzer to an interior room [lest he forget, and take things from there to the Chatzer after Bitul, which is forbidden].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> Shmuel taught that Bitul does not work from one Chatzer to another!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I hold like R. Yochanan, who says that Bitul works from one Chatzer to another.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> If you don't hold like Shmuel, you should hold that afterwards they may be Mevatel 'back' your Chatzer [and you will be permitted. Why did you clear your things from the room?]</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">68b----------------------------------------68b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> (If Reuven and Shimon did not make an Eruv in their joint Chatzer,) Reuven may be Mevatel (allowing Shimon to take things to the Chatzer), and later Shimon may be Mevatel (permitting Reuven).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Regarding Bitul after Bitul, I hold like Shmuel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Once Reuven was Mevatel, others cannot be Mevatel [back to him to permit him on Shabbos].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Shmuel's second law depends on his first! (It is unreasonable to hold like Shmuel for only the second law.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel holds that when Reuven is Mevatel, he withdraws from [any affiliation with] the Chatzer. It is as if he is from another Chatzer. To be Mevatel back to him is like Bitul from one Chatzer to another. His first law says that this does not work!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If you hold like his second law, you must hold that [others cannot be Mevatel back, for] one cannot be Mevatel to another Chatzer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> No. Shmuel does not allow Bitul after Bitul lest Chachamim's words appear like a mockery. (People are not serious about Bitul at all. They alternate being Mevatel all day, to permit carrying whenever they want.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Bitul after Bitul works.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It does not work.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav and Shmuel argue like R. Eliezer and Chachamim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav holds like Chachamim (69b, who forbid others to take things from the house of Reuven (the Mevatel). Since he was not Mevatel his house. he did not withdraw from the Chatzer. Therefore, Shimon can be Mevatel back to him);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Shmuel holds like R. Eliezer (26b, who permits others to take things from Reuven's house, since he was Mevatel it. It is as if he is from another Chatzer. Therefore, Shimon cannot be Mevatel back to him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Even R. Eliezer could hold like Rav. R. Eliezer says that one who is Mevatel his share in a Chatzer is also Mevatel his house, for one cannot live in a house without access to a Chatzer. However, he does not withdraw from the Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Even Chachamim could hold like Shmuel. They say that one is not Mevatel more than he says, i.e. his share in the Chatzer (but not his house). However, the Bitul he does is absolute. He withdraws from the Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Chana):</span> Tana'im argue like Rav and Shmuel do:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If someone [forgot to be Me'arev, and] gave Reshus (was Mevatel his share in the Chatzer), and took something into the Chatzer, whether this was b'Shogeg or b'Mezid, he forbids;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he forbids only if it was b'Mezid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Meir holds that Bitul after Bitul works (for he remains affiliated with the Chatzer), and R. Yehudah holds that it does not work.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Acha bar Tachlifa):</span> No, all agree that it does not work. They argue about whether or not we decree about Shogeg due to Mezid. R. Meir decrees, R. Yehudah does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Affirmation (of Suggestion (m) - Rav Ashi):</span> Rav and Shmuel argue like R. Eliezer and Chachamim.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Gamliel):</span> A case occurred in which a Tzeduki lived with us in a Mavoy in Yerushalayim... (Tzedukim and Baisusim do not heed Divrei Chachamim.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a Yisrael lives with a Nochri, Tzeduki or Baisusi, the latter forbids the Yisrael;</p></div>
