<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TIKUN OF A MAVOY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it has Tzuras ha'Pesach, even if the width exceeds 10, it need not be reduced.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that Tzuras ha'Pesach permits a Mavoy that is too wide, and Amaltra (the forms of nests or long cedar boards - 3a) permits a Mavoy that is too tall. Does each of these permit also the other?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1 (Beraisa):</span> If a Mavoy is more than 20 Amos tall, it must be lowered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it has Tzuras ha'Pesach, it need not be lowered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Amaltra permit a Mavoy that is too wide?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a Mavoy is more than 20 Amos tall, it must be reduced;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is wider than 10 Amos, it must be reduced;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it has Tzuras ha'Pesach, it need not be reduced.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If it has Amaltra, it need not be reduced.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The last clause (regarding Amaltra) refers to the Seifa (if it is too wide)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> [Perhaps] it refers to the Reisha (if it is too tall).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT DOES TZURAS HA'PESACH PERMIT?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah (to Chiya bar Rav):</span> It need not be reduced.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav (to Rav Yehudah):</span> [Even if it has Tzuras ha'Pesach,] it must be reduced!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Yosef):</span> This shows that if most of [the perimeter of] a Chatzer is openings and windows, it is not permitted through Tzuras ha'Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An opening more than 10 Amos forbids a Mavoy, and Parutz Merubah Al ha'Omed forbids a Chatzer. Just like Tzuras ha'Pesach does not permit more than 10, it does not permit Parutz Merubah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from an opening more than 10, since it is not permitted for Pasei Bira'os according to R. Meir, whereas all permit Parutz Merubah for Pasei Bira'os!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If walls [of a Chatzer] are Ruban (mostly) openings and windows, it is permitted, as long as there is Omed Merubah Al ha'Parutz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If they are mostly openings and windows, this is Parutz Merubah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if Riban (there are many) openings and windows, it is permitted, as long as there is Omed Merubah Al ha'Parutz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Kahana):</span> The Beraisa refers to Shimai (desolate or broken) openings.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are considered Shimai openings?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Rechumi or Rav Yosef):</span> The sides are not straight. (Rather, they are jagged. E.g. rocks were removed and some remaining rocks jut out);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of Rav Rechumi and Rav Yosef):</span> There is nothing on top of the opening.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>R. Yochanan agrees with Rav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin bar Rav Ada):</span> A case occurred in which a man inserted four poles in the corners of a field and strung a vine over them. Chachamim permitted regarding Kil'ayim (they are like walls to permit growing vines inside and grain just outside);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Just like they permitted regarding Kil'ayim, they permitted regarding Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They permitted regarding Kil'ayim, but not regarding Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He strung the vines to the side. [They are not attached to the tops of the poles, rather, somewhere in the middle.]</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Chisda taught that Tzuras ha'Pesach to the side does nothing! (Reish Lakish would not permit regarding Shabbos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He strung the vines on top of the poles.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How big was the gap between poles?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it was [at most] 10, R. Yochanan would not forbid regarding Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was more than 10.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, it was 10, and to the side. They argue about Rav Chisda's law. (Reish Lakish holds that Tzuras ha'Pesach to the side helps.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> [If so] R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish both contradict themselves!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish citing R. Yehudah bar Chanina):</span> Pei'ah (a vine stretched from one pole to another) permits regarding Kil'ayim, but not regarding Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Just like it is not a wall regarding Shabbos, it is not a wall regarding Kil'ayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1 (for Reish Lakish):</span> Reish Lakish himself holds that it is a wall for both. His latter teaching merely cited the opinion of R. Yehudah bar Chanina. He does not agree.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The contradiction in R. Yochanan remains!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we would say that his first teaching discusses vines on top of the poles, we could answer that the latter discusses vines to the sides;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, the rejection (m) asserts that also his first teaching discusses vines to the sides!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> Both teachings discuss vines to the sides. In the first, there are 10 Amos between poles. In the second, there are more than 10.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to distinguish between 10 and more than 10?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan told Reish Lakish that when R. Yehoshua went to learn Torah from R. Yochanan ben Nuri, he found him sitting between trees with vines strung between them. Even though R. Yehoshua was proficient in Hilchos Kil'ayim, he asked if one may grow vines inside the trees and grain outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Nuri:</span> If there are 10 Amos between poles, it is permitted. If there are more than 10, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He strung the vines on top of the poles.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> If poles were inserted in the ground and he made Pei'ah on top, even if the poles are more than 10 from each other, it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He strung the vines to the sides of the poles.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> He strung them to the sides, and it is permitted only if they are at most 10 from each other.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TZURAS HA'PESACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Tzuras ha'Pesach to the side does nothing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Tzuras ha'Pesach must be strong enough to hold a door. Even a door of straw suffices.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Tzuras ha'Pesach requires Heker Tzir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Avya):</span> It is a hole [in the Korah above (R. Chananel) and a hole below in the floor (Ri'az, in Shiltei Giborim on Rif)] for a hinge-pin (a pole on which a door swings).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Acha brei d'Rav Avya:</span> Did Rav Ashi teach anything about Tzuras ha'Pesach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Talmidim of Rav Ashi:</span> He did not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Tzuras ha'Pesach is a stick on each side and a stick on top of them. (Rabbeinu Meir (brought in Rosh) - Rav Acha brings this Beraisa, which does not require the Korah to be a Tefach thick. It can be Mashehu (arbitrarily small). Surely, Heker Tzir is required, for no one argues with Reish Lakish. Ri'az - the Korah can be Mashehu, i.e. it need not be big enough for Heker Tzir.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must the top stick touch the others?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> It need not touch.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> It must touch.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Rav Nachman relied on his leniency to make a Tzuras ha'Pesach for the Reish Galusa (the executive head of Bnei Yisrael in Bavel). Rav Sheshes told his attendant, Rav Gada, to knock it down. He obeyed. (Perhaps Rav Sheshes was unable to do so himself, for he was blind). People of the Reish Galusa's house incarcerated him. Rav Sheshes came to the door and requested that Gada come out. They let him out. (Ya'avetz - they had assumed that he himself decided to knock it down. When they heard that Rav Sheshes told him to, they released him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes (to Rabah bar Shmuel):</span> Do you know any Beraisos about Tzuras ha'Pesach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Shmuel - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If [the opening of] a gate is shaped like a dome [on top, and below has Raglayim, i.e. straight side walls separated by at least four Tefachim], one must affix a Mezuzah. (It is a proper opening due to the Raglayim, even though the dome separates between them and the top - this refutes Rav Sheshes);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Chachamim exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>All agree that if the Raglayim are 10 Tefachim tall, it needs a Mezuzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> All agree that if it (the total height) is less than 10 Tefachim or if the Raglayim are less than three Tefachim tall, it is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue in a case where the Raglayim are [at least] three and it is [at least] 10, and at the height of 10 it is less than four Tefachim wide, but there is room in the wall to carve out and complete the width to four. R. Meir says Chokekim Lehashlim (it is considered as if enough was carved out to complete the Shi'ur), and Chachamim do not. (See Perush Chai diagram, Perek 1 number 153, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-1chai153.jpg>English Charts</a> section.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes (to Rabah bar Shmuel):</span> If you encounter people of the Reish Galusa's house, do not mention this Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>HECHSHER MAVOY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Hechsher (what is necessary to permit carrying in a) Mavoy is a Lechi and a Korah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Beis Hillel say, it is a Lechi <i>or</i> a Korah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, it is Lechayayim (one Lechi on each side).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A Talmid citing R. Yishmael said in front of R. Akiva that Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that a Lechi or Korah permits a Mavoy [if the width of the opening is] less than four Amos.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> They argue in both cases (more or less than four Amos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Our Mishnah is not like Chananyah (6a, who says that all require a door on at least one side) nor like Chachamim [who require Tzuras ha'Pesach]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> (Chananyah and Chachamim discuss a Mavoy Mefulash.) Our Mishnah discusses a Mavoy Sasum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai require a Lechi and a Korah, and Beis Hillel require a Lechi or Korah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Beis Shamai require a Lechi and a Korah [to make a proper Mechitzah] because they hold that mid'Oraisa, Reshus ha'Yachid needs four walls!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Beis Hillel require only a Lechi or a Korah (a mere Heker for the fourth wall. They require three proper walls) because they hold that mid'Oraisa, three walls makes Reshus ha'Yachid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They require only two walls regarding [Chiyuv for] throwing. They require three [proper] walls [mid'Rabanan] to carry. (Rashba - we merely show that one cannot bring a proof from here. Really, they require three walls mid'Oraisa. Only R. Yehudah says that two suffice.)</p></div>
