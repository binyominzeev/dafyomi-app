<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav Chisda gave rulings in Kafri while Rav Huna was alive [in Pumbadisa];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rav Hamnuna gave rulings in Charta while Rav Chisda was alive [elsewhere].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>(It was enacted that a slaughterer must bring his knife to the local Chacham to inspect it, for the honor of the Chacham.) Ravina inspected a knife in Bavel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Why did you do so? (You take honor for yourself in place of me, your Rebbi!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> [You were in a different city. Also] Rav Hamnuna gave rulings in Charta while Rav Chisda was alive [elsewhere]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> It was taught that Rav Hamnuna <i>did not</i> give rulings!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> It was taught that he gave rulings, and it was taught that he did not. He did not rule while his Rebbi, Rav Huna, was alive, but he did during the life of Rav Chisda, to whom he was a Talmid Chaver (a colleague who learned some teachings from him);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Likewise, I am a Talmid Chaver to you!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> A Chacham may inspect his own knife [for slaughter].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Ravina visited Mechuza. His host gave him his knife to inspect.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> Show it to Rava! (He is the local Chacham.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">His host:</span> Rava taught that a Chacham may inspect his own knife! (I slaughter for you. This is like inspecting for yourself)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> I pay you for the meat. You are like any other Shochet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Eliezer of Hegronya and Rav Acha bar Tachlifa visited Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika. He wanted to slaughter a third-grown calf for them. He showed the knife to them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Acha bar Tachlifa:</span> You should show it to Rav Acha bar Yakov. This is his region!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Rava taught that a Chacham may inspect his own knife!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Eliezer inspected it, and he was punished.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava permits this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Since they already suggested bringing it to the local Chacham, he should not have deterred them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rava's law does not apply to Rav Acha bar Yakov, for he was exceptionally aged and Chacham.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>RULING IN FRONT OF ONE'S REBBI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One may stop someone from transgressing [even though it implicitly teaches a Halachah] in front of one's Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Ravina was in front of Rav Ashi. He saw a man tying his donkey to a tree on Shabbos. He shouted at him, but the man did not stop. Ravina excommunicated him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Ravina (to Rav Ashi):</span> Was it brazen (R. Yehonason - if I was not a Talmid Chaver, rather, a Talmid, would it be brazen) for me to do so in front of you?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> "Ein Chachmah v'Ein Tevunah v'Ein Etzah l'Neged Hash-m" - we do not stop to honor the Rebbi when Hash-m's name is being desecrated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One may not rule in front of one's Rebbi. One is Chayav Misah [b'Yedei Shamayim] for this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Not in front of his Rebbi it is forbidden, but one is not Chayav Misah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even not in front of his Rebbi one is Chayav Misah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Aharon's sons were killed because they [implicitly] ruled in front of Moshe their Rebbi:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>They expounded "v'Nasnu Bnei Aharon ha'Kohen Esh Al ha'Mizbe'ach" - even though fire descends from Shamayim, it is a Mitzvah for people to bring fire. (Rashi - they expounded correctly. Ra'avad - they erred. The verse applies only to the outer Mizbe'ach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Talmid of R. Eliezer ruled in front of him. R. Eliezer told his wife 'I will be amazed if he survives the year!' He did not survive the year. She thought that R. Eliezer must be a Navi!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> I am not a Navi, nor even one training to be a Navi. I have a tradition that one who rules in front of his Rebbi is Chayav Misah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The Talmid was Yehudah ben Gurya. He was three Parsa'os (about 12 kilometers) away from his Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yehudah ruled in front of R. Eliezer. (He <i>lived</i> three Parsa'os from his Rebbi.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah taught that he was three Parsa'os away! (Surely, he teaches that he did not rule in front of him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Why did Rabah teach the name of the Talmid and his father?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> Rabah gave details so we will know that this actually occurred, and it is not a mere parable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> One who rules in front of his Rebbi deserves to be bitten by a snake. It says "va'Ya'an Elihu... Tza'ir Anochi la'Yomim v'Atem Yesisim Al Ken Zochalti (I fear to speak in front of you because you are older than me)", like "Im Chamas Zochalei Afar."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> He is called a sinner - "b'Libi Tzafanti Imrasecha Lema'an Lo Echeta Lach." (I held my words inside to refrain from sinning.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Hamnuna):</span> It says "b'Libi Tzafanti Imrasecha", and it says "Bisarti Tzedek b'Kahal Rav" (David taught in public)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not teach in the life of Ira ha'Ya'iri (his Rebbi), only after his death.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Zavda):</span> If one gives all his Matanos Kehunah to one Kohen, this brings hunger to the world (other Kohanim). It says "Ira ha'Ya'iri Hayah Chohen l'David";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was he Kohen only for David?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He gave [all] his Matanos Kehunah to him. Afterwards it says "va'Yhi Ra'av bi'Ymei David".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One who rules in front of his Rebbi is demoted from his grandeur. We learn from "va'Yomer Elazar..." (He told the soldiers to Kasher the Kelim taken from the war with Midyan.) Even though he said that Hash-m told this to Moshe and not to himself, he was punished for this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Yehoshua should have had to ask Elazar (Rashi - to ask matters of Hash-m through the Urim v'Tumim; Rashash - matters of Halachah) -- "v'Lifnei Elazar ha'Kohen Ya'amod." However, we do not find that he did.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>YEHOSHUA'S PUNISHMENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> One who rules in front of his Rebbi dies without sons - "va'Ya'an Yehoshua... Meshares Moshe... Kela'em." (He decided that Eldad and Medad are liable for prophesizing that Moshe will not lead Bnei Yisrael into Eretz Yisrael);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "Nun Beno Yehoshua Beno" (it does not list sons of Yehoshua, for he did not have any. He did have daughters Megilah (14b).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He argues with R. Aba bar Papa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Papa):</span> Yehoshua was punished [by not having sons] because he caused Bnei Yisrael to refrain from procreation for a night. "Ani Sar Tzeva Hash-m Atah Vasi" - the angel rebuked Yehoshua for failing to offer yesterday's afternoon Tamid, and for not learning Torah in depth now.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Yehoshua:</span> For which of these did you come?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">The angel:</span> "Atah Vasi" (for Bitul Torah now).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Immediately, "va'Yalech Yehoshua...b'Soch ha'Emek" - he spent the night in the depth of Halachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>We have a tradition, that when the Aron [of Betzalel, containing the second Luchos] and the Shechinah are not in their proper place, one may not have relations. (The Aron was with Yehoshua. He did not return it to the Mishkan in Gilgal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel bar Inya):</span> Learning Torah is greater than bringing the Temidim. The angel came due to neglect of Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Berona):</span> It says about those who sleep in a room where a couple dwell "Neshei Ami Tegarshun mi'Beis Ta'anugeha." (They separate women from their husbands.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> This is even if she is Nidah. (They are ashamed to speak in front of others.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If she is Nidah, the stranger should be blessed! (He ensures that they will not transgress.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This is wrong. We are not concerned lest a man sin with his wife when she is Nidah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>DEALING WITH A NOCHRI WHO REFUSES TO RENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A certain Nochri who lived in a Mavoy with Yisraelim refused to rent his Reshus. The Yisraelim asked Abaye what to do.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> All of you should be Mevatel your Reshus to one Yisrael. Then, you are like [many Yisraelim in] one residence of a Yisrael. A Nochri does not forbid in this case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Nochri does not forbid when only one Yisrael lives there, for this is uncommon. Here, many Yisraelim live with him. This is common!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is not common for everyone to be Mevatel his Reshus to one member. Chachamim did not decree about something uncommon.</p></div>
