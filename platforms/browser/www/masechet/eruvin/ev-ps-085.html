<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>USAGE THROUGH AIR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> If there is a pit [in a Mavoy] between two Chatzeros four Tefachim away from [the wall of] each, each must extend a ledge of any size from its wall in order to draw water from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah himself):</span> It suffices for each to extend a reed [from its wall].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> [Surely,] Rav Yehudah learned this from Shmuel! (He was a Talmid of Rav and Shmuel);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not from Rav, for Rav holds that one who uses something through the air (it is horizontally four Tefachim away from him) does not forbid another from using it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Abaye says that Rav Yehudah learned from Shmuel that some Tikun is required.) From which teaching did he learn? (Surely, if Abaye teaches that Rav Yehudah learned this from Shmuel, he did not hear Rav Yehudah explicitly say this in the name of Shmuel!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav Nachman taught in the name of Shmuel that if a roof borders Reshus ha'Rabim, it is permitted only if there is a fixed ladder. [Normally, the width of Reshus ha'Rabim does not extend to houses on the side, low rocks keep them four Tefachim away. Even so, they forbid due to usage through air!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps this is like Rav Papa established it. (Rabim rest their hats and turbans on it. This is convenient. We cannot learn from it to regular usage through air.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav Yehudah learns from what he himself said in the name of Shmuel, that when there is a pit between two Chatzeros, each must extend a ledge of any size;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Without the ledge, they forbid each other due to usage through air! (Really, Abaye heard the teaching. Rav Yehudah himself taught a bigger Chidush, that a reed suffices. He learned this from Shmuel. Since any size ledge suffices, it is a mere Heker lest they come to use a joint Reshus without an Eruv, so even a reed suffices.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> From which teaching of Rav do we know that he holds that usage through air does not forbid?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A Mishnah teaches that if two balconies are one above the other, and a Mechitzah was made only for the top one, both are forbidden unless they are Me'arev together;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> This is only if they are close [within four Tefachim of each other horizontally]. If they are four apart, the upper one is permitted, and the lower one is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps there, usage through air does not forbid because [of another factor --] the upper balcony's usage is [relatively] convenient and the lower balcony's is inconvenient. The top balcony just lowers, but the lower balcony must throw and lower!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav Nachman said in the name of Rav that if there are three ruins [in a row] between two houses, each house may use the ruin adjacent to it through throwing [through a window]. The middle ruin is forbidden [to both of them].</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">85b----------------------------------------85b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Rav Berona said this in the name of Rav. R. Elazar was skeptical. He went to ask Rav if he indeed said it. Rav said that he did.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> [Since you forbid the middle ruin, this shows that usage through air forbids. If so, you must permit to each house the ruin near it because it is more convenient for it than for the other house.] However, you taught that if one uses through throwing and the other by lowering, both are forbidden [even though lowering is more convenient than throwing]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav:</span> You assume that the ruins are in a line. Really, they are in a triangle [like the picture in the Gemara]. Each is adjacent to the middle ruin. This is not usage through air.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rav Papa):</span> Shmuel [who forbids due to usage through air] argues with Rav Dimi [even though a Mishnah (76b) supports Rav Dimi]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> If a place [at least three Tefachim tall] is less than four by four [Tefachim, it is Makom Patur], people of Reshus ha'Rabim or Reshus ha'Yachid may unload on it, as long as they do not use it to transfer [from one Reshus to the other. Such a small place is inconvenient, like usage through air!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, Shmuel agrees about Reshuyos mid'Oraisa (Reshus ha'Yachid and Reshus ha'Rabim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He argues about Reshuyos mid'Rabanan. He holds that [for them] Chachamim were more stringent about their decrees than about Torah laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Rav could not have said this ((k), that each house may use the ruin adjacent to it, for the other house does not forbid due to usage through air)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If there are two houses on opposite sides of Reshus ha'Rabim, one may not throw from one to the other;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We established that they discuss when one of the houses is higher than the other. [It is difficult to reach the destination, therefore] Rav forbids lest the object fall in Reshus ha'Rabim and he will come to take it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHERE MAY THE ERUV BE LEFT?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one put an Eruv in a Beis Sha'ar, Achsadra or porch, it is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One who lives in one of these [need not give towards the Eruv in the Chatzer, for he] does not forbid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one put an Eruv in a cattle pen or storehouse for straw, wood or produce, it is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>One who lives in one of these forbids [if he does not give towards the Eruv];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if the owner has Tefisas Yad (rights of usage), the one who dwells there does not forbid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> Any place that [someone living there] does not forbid, if one put Eruv [Chatzeros] there, it is invalid, except for a Beis Sha'ar of an individual;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Any place that is invalid for [putting] an Eruv is valid for Shituf, except for [the open floor of] a Mavoy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learn this from our Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one put <i>an Eruv</i> in a Beis Sha'ar, Achsadra or porch, it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Shituf is valid in these places!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He needs to teach about a Beis Sha'ar of an individual and [the open floor of] a Mavoy, which the Mishnah did not teach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one put an Eruv in a Beis Sha'ar, porch, Chatzer or Mavoy, it is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> It is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> We must say that the Beraisa permits <i>Shituf</i> in these places.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the Beraisa Machshir if it was left in a Mavoy? It is not guarded there!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should say 'Chatzer <i>in</i> a Mavoy' [and not 'Chatzer <i>or</i> Mavoy'].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> If people were eating together and Shabbos came, they can rely on the bread on the table for Eruv;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> They rely on it for Shituf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> The versions do not argue. If were eating in a house, they rely on it for Eruv. If were eating in a Chatzer, they rely on it for Shituf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> Eruvei Chatzeros are left in the Chatzer, and Shitufei Mavo'os are left in the Mavoy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> An Eruv in the Chatzer is invalid!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one put an Eruv in a Beis Sha'ar, Achsadra or porch, it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means 'Eruvei Chatzeros are left <i>in a house</i> in the Chatzer, and Shitufei Mavo'os are left <i>in a Chatzer</i> in the Mavoy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If the owner has Tefisas Yad, the one who dwells there does not forbid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered Tefisas Yad?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like the Chatzer of (Bach - ben) Bunyas. (He had many Kelim in houses, and he would let people live in the houses.)</p></div>
