<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Abaye does not consider fish to be Gidulei Karka!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If one ate Putisa (a bug found in water), he receives four sets of [39] lashes. (There are two Lavim for Sheretz ha'Mayim, and two [general] Lavim for [all kinds of] Sheratzim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he ate an ant, he is lashed five times. (There are two general Lavim, and three for Sheretz ha'Aretz);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he ate a wasp, he is lashed six times [for the above five and for Sheretz ha'Of].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If fish are considered Gidulei Karka, one who eats Putisa should be liable also for Sheretz ha'Aretz!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> They argue about birds:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beraisa #1 includes them, for they reproduce and are Gidulei Karka;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beraisa #2 excludes them, for they were not created from the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do these two opinions expound the Klal u'Frat u'Chlal?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The opinion that includes birds holds that the latter Klal is primary. Essentially, it is a Prat u'Chelal, in which the Klal adds to the Prat and includes everything;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Klal teaches us not to [make a Prat u'Chelal and] include everything. Rather, we exclude anything that does not resemble the Peratim in two respects (reproducing and growing from the ground);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The opinion that excludes birds holds that the first Klal is primary. Essentially, it is a Klal u'Ferat; in which we include only the Prat;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The latter Klal teaches us not to [make a Klal u'Ferat and] include only the Prat. Rather, we include anything that resembles the Peratim in three respects (it was also created from the ground).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MAY ONE BE ME'AREV WITH FOODS NOT COMMONLY EATEN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may be Me'arev with Pa'apu'in (a type of beet or cress), purslane, and coriander, but not with immature grain (fodder) or Kafniyos (bad unripe dates).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One cannot be Me'arev with coriander!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> People with many children may eat coriander (it reduces a person's seed), but people without children may not eat it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When it is hard [like wood], i.e. when seeds sprout inside, no one should eat it. (It is harmful.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Someone with children may be Me'arev with it before it hardened;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Even someone without children may be Me'arev with it. (Rav holds like the first Tana of our Mishnah):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may be Me'arev for a Nazir with wine, and for a Yisrael with Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Even though they may not eat it, since others may eat it, it is valid. The same applies here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rav refers to coriander of Madai, which is good for everyone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav permits to be Me'arev with fodder!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may be Me'arev with hops or fodder. One blesses Borei Peri ha'Adamah on it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Before he came to Bavel he forbade it. After he came [and saw that people eat it], he permitted it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Why is the Halachah based on Bavel?) Bavel is not the majority of the world!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one planted beans, barley or clover to eat the vegetable [when it is moist], we ignore his intent and follow the practice of normal people [who eat only the seeds]. Therefore, the seeds are Tevel [must be tithed], the vegetable is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one planted cress or Gargir [a kind of mustard] to eat the vegetable, the vegetable and seeds are Tevel. If he planted them for the seeds, the seeds and vegetable are Tevel. (Tosfos - in both cases, both are Tevel. The Beraisa teaches them separately to teach that Ma'aser is primarily for the one he intended for. This determines whether Ma'aser Sheni or Oni is given. (Ma'aser of vegetables depends on when they are picked. For seeds we follow the time it was a third grown. These could be in different years.) It also affects which is considered better. One may not declare bad produce to be Ma'aser to exempt good.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav refers to fodder grown in a garden (everyone eats it).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Gargir seeds used for?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Previous generations did not have peppercorns, so they would crush these seeds and dip roasted meat in them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>When R. Zeira was weary from learning, he would sit in front of the door to Rav Yehudah bar Ami's academy, in order to stand up for Rabanan passing by and earn reward. A child exited after learning from his Rebbi. R. Zeira asked him what he learned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">The child:</span> One blesses Borei Peri ha'Adamah on hops. One blesses sheha'Kol [Nihyah bi'Dvaro] on fodder.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> The opposite would be more reasonable! Fodder grows from the ground. Hops grow [on shrubs. They do not nurture from the ground, rather,] from the air!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>The Halachah is like the child learned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hops is finished produce, but fodder is not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Zeira objected because hops grow from the air. Really, they grow from the ground. If one cuts the shrub, the hops will die.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THINGS THAT ARE IMPROVED THROUGH COOKING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may be Me'arev with Kafniyos! (Why does Rav forbid?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may buy Kor (Rashi - shoots of a date tree; Rambam - the top of a date tree) with Ma'aser money; and it does not have Tum'as Ochlim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One may buy Kafniyos with Ma'aser money; and they have Tum'as Ochlim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, Kor is like wood in every respect, except that one may buy it with Ma'aser money. Kafniyos are like fruit in every respect, except that they are exempt from Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa discusses Kafniyos of 'male' trees that could never become proper dates.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, R. Yehudah would not exempt from Ma'aser!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Pagim (unripe figs) of Beisun (a place) were mentioned only regarding Ma'aser. Pagim of Beisun and Kafniyos of [male trees of] Tuvina are Tevel. (They are considered finished fruit.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, they come from normal trees. They have Tum'as Ochlim [because they could be fixed] like R. Yochanan taught [elsewhere]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is because they could be sweetened through cooking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did R. Yochanan discuss?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Small bitter almonds are Tevel. (They are considered finished fruit, since they are too bitter when they are big.) Large ones are exempt. Large sweet almonds are Tevel. Small ones are exempt. (They are unfinished.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> Both [small or large almonds that are bitter] are exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> Both are Tevel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [In version #2,] why are they Tevel? They are not proper to eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> They can be sweetened through cooking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Kor is like wood in every respect, except that it may be bought with Ma'aser money.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He does not argue with the first Tana!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> They argue about if it was well cooked or fried. (The first Tana was Metaher only when only when it is like wood. R. Yehudah did not distinguish.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> No one would be Metaher if they were cooked or fried!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Skin and a fetal sac are not Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the skin was well cooked, or one intended to eat the fetal sac, they are Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim. (Cooking helps for skin. All the more so it helps for Kor, which was edible to begin with!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> They argue about its Berachah. (The first Tana says that one blesses Borei Peri ha'Adamah. R. Yehudah says that one blesses sheha'Kol, for it is destined to harden);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One blesses Borei Peri ha'Adamah on Kora (Kor);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One blesses sheha'Kol.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rav Yehudah says [that one blesses] Borei Peri ha'Adamah, for it is a food;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Shmuel says sheha'Kol, for in the end it will harden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel (to Rav Yehudah):</span> Your opinion is more reasonable, for radishes get hard in the end, yet the Berachah is Borei Peri ha'Adamah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>This is wrong. Radishes are planted for their own sake, but trees are not planted for Kora.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Even though Shmuel commended Rav Yehudah, the Halachah follows Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SHI'URIM OF VARIOUS FOODS FOR AN ERUV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may be Me'arev with hops or fodder. One blesses Borei Peri ha'Adamah on them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The Shi'ur for an Eruv is the amount eaten in two meals.) What is the Shi'ur for hops?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like Rav Yechi'el said [below, about other matters], a handful.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Shi'ur for fodder?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Tuvya bar Yitzchak):</span> It is a bundle of vegetables [that farmers wrap together].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chilkiya bar Yitzchak):</span> One may be Me'arev with Kalya (a stalk hard like wood).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, one may be Me'arev with the vegetable of Kalya.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Shi'ur?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yechi'el):</span> It is a handful.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one be Me'arev with moist beans?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>R. Yirmeyah did not know. He asked in the Beis Medrash.</p></div>
