<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE LENIENCY OF TOWELS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did he permit regarding drying themselves with towels?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> One may dry himself with a towel and leave it in a [nearby] window. He may not give it to a bathhouse attendant, for they are suspected of this matter (squeezing them, to give to another bather. He may not take the towel home, lest he forget and squeeze it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon says, he may even take it home. (R. Chananya was lenient to them like R. Shimon.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MAY ONE SPILL WATER THROUGH THE MECHITZAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The Mechitzah permits only drawing water, but not to spill [waste]water [into the channel].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shizbi):</span> What is the difference between spilling into the channel or into an Ukah (a pit for wastewater? An Ukah permits pouring into a small Chatzer, even if the Ukah was full before Shabbos and the water will spill out to Reshus ha'Rabim!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Water is wont to be absorbed into the ground [of the Chatzer], so we are not concerned even if it flows outside. (Even if he would intend for this, it is not a clear transgression, since he pours into Reshus ha'Yachid.) However, one who spills into the channel knows that it will go outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Not only is it permitted to draw water. Rather, one may even spill into the channel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Shizbi):</span> This is obvious! Why should it be different than spilling into an Ukah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that one may spill into the Ukah because water is wont to be absorbed in the Chatzer, but one may not spill into the channel, because he knows that it will go outside. Rabah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if two balconies are one above the other, and a Mechitzah was made only for the top one, both are forbidden unless they Me'arev together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This is only if they are near each other (the horizontal distance between them is less than four Tefachim). If they are far apart, the top balcony is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like Rav taught elsewhere, that usage through air does not forbid.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CAN ONE STEAL A RESHUS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> One may steal [a Reshus that he normally uses during the week, e.g. a ruin that the owner rarely uses] on Shabbos. He must return the ruin to its owner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is self-contradictory!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says that one may steal [a Reshus] on Shabbos. This implies that he acquires it. (Rashi - he may carry in it. Tosfos R. Peretz - he forbids the owner.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>'He must return the ruin to its owner' implies that he does not acquire it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that the law of [returning] theft applies to a Reshus stolen on Shabbos. (Rashi - he is forbidden. R. Peretz - he does not forbid the owner.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against himself - Rabah - Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if two balconies are one above the other...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the law of theft applies to Shabbos, why are both forbidden? (The owner, i.e. the top balcony, should be permitted!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The case is, both balconies made the Mechitzah together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even if they made a Mechitzah also for the bottom balcony, both should be forbidden [like two Chatzeros open to each other that were not Me'arev together]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since they made a separate Mechitzah for the bottom balcony, this shows that they withdraw from the top one.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>HOW ONE MAY SPILL WATER IN A CHATZER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Chatzer is less than four [by four] Amos, one may pour wastewater into it only if there is an Ukah (pit) that holds Se'atayim (about 24 liters) below the hole [from which water flows out];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Ukah can be inside the Chatzer or outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is outside, it must be covered. If it is inside, it need not be covered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, if the first four Amos in Reshus ha'Rabim of a Biv (a drainage ditch) are covered, one may pour into it. (Rashi - a covered area is not Reshus ha'Rabim mid'Oraisa, for it is unlike the encampment in the Midbar - Shabbos 5a. Rashbam - it does not look like the water comes from the Chatzer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Chachamim say, one may not pour into a Biv [or gutter pipe] even if it extends 100 Amos along a roof or Chatzer [lest people who see the water gush to Reshus ha'Rabim assume that it was poured from nearby].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may pour onto the roof, and the water will spill into the Biv.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>A Chatzer and an Achsadra (a room open on one side) join with each other to comprise four Amos [to permit pouring without an Ukah];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Similarly, if there are two Aliyos (second story apartments, which overlook a small Chatzer) opposite each other, and only one of them made an Ukah, only those who made the Ukah are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the reason [that a Chatzer at least four Amos does not need an Ukah]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> A person normally uses [and needs to dispose of] about Se'atayim of water a day. If the Chatzer is [at least four by] four Amos, he wants to sprinkle it [on the ground, to prevent dust from rising. We will say (Amud B) that our Mishnah applies to summer];</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">88b----------------------------------------88b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is less than four, he spills it. (Ritva - he would not sprinkle, for it is too small for dignified usage.) Therefore, it is permitted only if he has an Ukah. (We decree lest he throw directly to Reshus ha'Rabim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Zeira):</span> If it is less than four, Se'atayim will not be absorbed in it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about if it is long and thin (e.g. two by eight Amos. There is enough area to absorb Se'atayim, but it is too narrow to sprinkle in it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A Chatzer and an Achsadra join to comprise four Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to R. Zeira, we understand. (Together there is enough area). However, this is difficult for Rabah. (They join even if the Achsadra is next to a corner of the Chatzer!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira, on behalf of Rabah):</span> They join only if the Achsadra is next to the Chatzer [and together they make a square four by four, e.g. each of them is two by four].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Chatzer is less than four [by four] Amos, one may not pour wastewater into it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like Rabah. (Also the width must be four.) According to R. Zeira, it depends only on the area!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> The Beraisa is like Chachamim [of the Seifa of our Mishnah. They forbid a Biv even if it is very long, because he intends to spill, and not to sprinkle. The Reisha of] our Mishnah is R. Eliezer ben Yakov [who permits pouring into a Biv that is four Amos, because the water will be absorbed].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What forced R. Zeira to say that [four Amos are needed for absorption, and that] the Reisha is R. Eliezer ben Yakov? (He should answer like Rabah, for then all agree to the Reisha!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He had a difficulty with the Mishnah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say 'if a Chatzer is less than...'? [This connotes that it depends on area.] It should say 'a Chatzer that does not have four [by four - Gra deletes this] Amos! (This connotes that it depends on the dimensions.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha is R. Eliezer [ben Yakov, who requires an area to absorb Se'atayim].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Seifa is R. Eliezer, surely the Reisha is not R. Eliezer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The entire Mishnah is R. Eliezer. It is abbreviated. It means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Chatzer is less than four Amos, one may not pour wastewater into it...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it is four Amos, one may pour. This is because R. Eliezer says that if a Biv is four Amos in Reshus ha'Rabim and is covered, one may pour into it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUMMER AND WINTER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> If a Biv is covered... [Chachamim say... one may pour onto the roof, and the water will spill into the Biv].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Our Mishnah is unlike Chananya;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chananya):</span> Chachamim say, even if a roof or Chatzer is 100 Amos, one may not pour onto it, for it is not apt to absorb. Rather, the water flows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Our Mishnah discusses summer. In winter, he may spill as much as he wants (Rashi - without an Ukah. Tosfos - in winter, Chachamim permit spilling into a Biv.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> In winter, one does not care if the water is absorbed. (The ground is muddy anyway. Therefore, he does not intend that it go to Reshus ha'Rabim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> A person wants wastewater to be absorbed, yet the Mishnah forbids spilling [into the Biv]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> In winter, there is no reason to forbid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He does not intend that the water go to Reshus ha'Rabim lest it dirty his Chatzer. It is already muddy [from rain]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We need not decree lest people see the water flowing [to Reshus ha'Rabim, and assume that one may spill in summer, or that one may throw directly to Reshus ha'Rabim]. They will assume that it is rainwater! (Water continues to flow even after the rain stopped - Ritva.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> In winter, if an Uka holds Se'atayim, one may spill Se'atayim into it. If it holds a Se'ah, one may spill a Se'ah into it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>In summer, if it holds Se'atayim, one may spill Se'atayim into it; if it holds a Se'ah, one may not spill anything into it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also in summer it should be permitted to spill a Se'ah into an Ukah that holds a Se'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decree to forbid this, lest one spill Se'atayim into it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same decree should apply in winter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In winter, there is no reason to forbid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He does not intend that the water go to Reshus ha'Rabim lest it dirty his Chatzer, for it is already muddy. We need not decree lest people see the water flowing. They will assume that it is rainwater!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Therefore [in winter, since there is no concern], there is no limit to the amount one may spill [if it holds Se'atayim].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>ONE UKAH FOR TWO ALIYOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if two Aliyos are opposite each other... [and only one of them made an Ukah, only those who made the Ukah are permitted].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is even if the Aliyos were Me'arev with each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is because two Aliyos spill twice the amount of wastewater. (The Ukah will not contain it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> Even if an Ukah, shard, wide ditch or small boat was full before Shabbos, one may spill water into it on Shabbos [even though it will not contain the water].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Rava taught that this is only if the Aliyos were not Me'arev with each other. (Tosfos - even the Aliyah that made the Ukah may not spill directly into it without an Eruv. Rather, they pour onto their balcony, and from there it falls to the Ukah);</p></div>
