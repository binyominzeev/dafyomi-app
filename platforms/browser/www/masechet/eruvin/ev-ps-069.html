<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>RETRACTION FROM BITUL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa [R. Meir]):</span> 'Take out the Kelim you want outside, and bring in what you want inside, before this abominable one does and forbids you.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the Tzeduki will take out after they took out, he will not forbid them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If someone was Mevatel and later took something out, whether this was b'Shogeg or b'Mezid, he forbids.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> The Mishnah should say 'he does not forbid'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> He forbids [if he takes out] before others were Machazik in (took Kelim to or from) the Mavoy, but not after they were Machazik.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If he took out before he gave Reshus, whether this was b'Shogeg or b'Mezid, he can be Mevatel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if he was Shogeg he can be Mevatel. If he was Mezid, he cannot be Mevatel (Tosfos - for he was Machazik in the Chatzer. Rashi - because it was forbidden to take out, he is a Mumar to [wantonly] be Mechalel Shabbos, so he is like a Nochri.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir says, if he gave Reshus and then took out, whether this was b'Shogeg or b'Mezid, he forbids. (He retracted from his Bitul. We decree Shogeg due to Mezid);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if he was Mezid he forbids. If he was Shogeg, he does not forbid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>This is only before others were Machazik. After they were Machazik, whether he was Shogeg or Mezid, he does not forbid.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHO IS LIKE A NOCHRI?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> He said 'do your needs in the Mavoy before it gets dark and he will forbid you.''</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This shows that [he considers] a Tzeduki to be like a Nochri. (Bitul does not help.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> He told them 'do your needs in the Mavoy [before Shabbos], before [he] will be Yotzi (take out) and forbid you.' (His Bitul helps until he takes out!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He meant '...before <i>the day</i> will be Yotzei (end, and Shabbos will begin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah discusses a Tzeduki who is Mechalel Shabbos in private. The Beraisa discusses one who is Mechalel in public. (He is like a Nochri.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Mumar or Giluy Panim (a brazen person) cannot be Mevatel Reshus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, a brazen person is not like a Mumar!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, a Mumar b'Giluy Panim (he openly transgresses) cannot be Mevatel Reshus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>A certain man went out [on Shabbos] with a band of fragrances (alternatively - a ring with a stamp). When he saw R. Yehudah Nesi'ah, he covered it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah Nesi'ah:</span> This person can be Mevatel according to R. Yehudah [since he is ashamed for me to see that he is Mechalel Shabbos].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> A Yisrael Mumar is one who is Mechalel Shabbos in public.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> Like which Tana is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not R. Meir. He holds that one who is suspected of transgressing any Mitzvah is suspected about all Mitzvos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is not Chachamim. They hold that one who is suspected of transgressing one Mitzvah is not suspected about other Mitzvos, unless he is a Mumar to serve idolatry!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">69b----------------------------------------69b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Rav Huna discusses who can give Reshus (Me'arev) and Mevatel Reshus:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Yisrael Mumar can be Mevatel Reshus only if he keeps Shabbos in public.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Yisrael can be Mevatel. A Nochri cannot be Mevatel. He must rent his Reshus to permit carrying.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>To be Mevatel, one says, 'my property is acquired to you' or 'it is Batel to you.' Chalipin (acquisition through a Kli such as a cloth) is not needed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Rav Huna holds like Chachamim. He holds like the following Tana that Chilul Shabbos is as severe as idolatry, like the following Tana:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "[If someone] <i>Mikem</i> [will offer an Olah]" - only some of you [may offer]. This excludes a Mumar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Mi'Kem" - I distinguish only among you (Yisrael), but not among other nations. (Any Nochri may offer an Olah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Min ha'Behemah" includes people (i.e. Resha'im) who resemble animals;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is the source that we accept Korbanos from sinners of Yisrael, to encourage them to repent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The exceptions are a Mumar, one who is Menasech (pours libations to idolatry), and one who is Mechalel Shabbos in public. (We do not accept from them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that "Mi'Kem" excludes a Mumar, and it says that we accept Korbanos from sinners of Yisrael!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha discusses a Mumar to the entire Torah. The middle clause discusses a Mumar to one Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> The exceptions are a Mumar and one who is Menasech or Mechalel Shabbos in public.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of Mumar is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He is not a Mumar to the whole Torah. The Reisha taught this!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>He is not a Mumar to one Mitzvah. The middle clause says that we accept from him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> Rather, the Seifa means that [we do not accept from] a Mumar who is Menasech or is Mechalel Shabbos in public.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The Tana equates idolatry and Chilul Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN DOES BITUL WORK?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one of the residents of a Chatzer forgot to give towards the Eruv, his house is forbidden [to transfer between it and the Chatzer] to him and to them (the Bnei Chatzer). Their houses are permitted to him and to them;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If they gave Reshus to him, he is permitted [to transfer between his house and the Chatzer], and they are forbidden [even from his house];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If two people forgot, they forbid each other;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because one person can give or receive Reshus. Two can give Reshus but cannot receive it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When may one give Reshus?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beis Shamai):</span> One may give Reshus [only] before Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beis Hillel):</span> One may give Reshus [even] on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Meir says, if someone gave Reshus then took something out, whether this was b'Shogeg or b'Mezid, he forbids;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if he was Mezid he forbids. If he was Shogeg, he does not forbid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> [In the Reisha] his house is forbidden, but his [share in the] Chatzer is permitted. (They may transfer between their houses and the Chatzer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he was Mevatel, his house should be permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he was not Mevatel, his Chatzer should be forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was Mevatel his Chatzer, but not his house. This is like Chachamim [who argue with R. Eliezer]. One who is Mevatel his share in a Chatzer does not Mevatel his house, for one can live in a house without a Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Their houses are permitted to him and to them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason [that he is permitted? He was Mevatel!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [After Bitul] he is like their guest.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they were Mevatel their Reshus to him, he is permitted and they are forbidden. (If they would use the Chatzer, it would look like they retract from their Bitul. R. Yehonason - even though one cannot retract after others were Machazik, it would look like they transgress.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that they are like his guests!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One person can be the guest of several hosts [this is common], but we do not consider several people to be guests of one host. (If one is Mevatel to one, he is considered a guest; the guest may transfer between the host's house and the Chatzer - Ritva (64a Im Ken). Me'iri - he is not considered a guest.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (This is a continuation of the Reisha, i.e. after he was Mevatel to them, they were Mevatel to him.) This shows that Bitul after Bitul works!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. It means that if [from the beginning] they were Mevatel their Reshus to him, he is permitted and they are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>IF TWO PEOPLE FORGOT TO BE ME'AREV IN A CHATZER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two people forgot, they forbid each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! (Any two partners in a Chatzer who were not Me'arev together forbid each other.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, [after everyone was Mevatel to them,] one of them was Mevatel to the other. One might have thought that the Bitul works;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so, because the first Bitul did not permit these two people. (They did not acquire the Reshus.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This is because one person can give [or receive Reshus...]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need this clause? The Mishnah already taught that one can give or receive Reshus!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that two can give Reshus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also this is obvious! (It already says, if <i>they</i> gave Reshus to him he is permitted...)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we decree to forbid this, lest people think that two people can receive Reshus. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [Two people] cannot receive Reshus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need this clause? (It already says that two people forbid each other!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It forbids even if others were Mevatel to one on condition that he will be Mevatel to the other.</p></div>
