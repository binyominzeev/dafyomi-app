<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RELATIONS IN FRONT OF A SEFER TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Achai arranged that his son should marry a daughter of R. Yitzchak bar Shmuel; his son was unable to consummate the marriage. Rav Achai went to investigate why; he found a Sefer Torah in the room.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Achai:</span> You endangered my son!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Relations are forbidden in a house with a Sefer Torah or Tefilin, unless it is removed (from the room) or in a Kli b'Soch Kli (enclosed in two vessels).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Vessels in which it is normally kept cannot be used (for both); even if it is in ten such vessels, they are considered like only one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A cloak over a chest containing Sifrei Torah is like Kli b'Soch Kli (the cloak is not normally used for them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> One must make a partition ten Tefachim tall in front of a Sefer Torah to permit relations [in the room].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Mar Zutra saw a ten Tefachim partition in front of a Sefer Torah in the room of Mar bar Rav Ashi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Mar Zutra (to Rav Ashi):</span> Do you hold like R. Yehoshua ben Levi? He only permits this if no other house is available -- you have another house!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> I did not think about this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SAYING SHEMA FACING A <i>BEIS HA'KISEI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [To say Shema,] one must distance himself four Amos from urine and excrement.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This suffices only if it is in back of him; if it is in front of him, he must distance himself as far as he can see.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The same applies to prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rafram bar Papa taught that one may pray facing a Beis ha'Kisei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That is when there is no excrement inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But Rav Yosef taught that [the Isur to pray near] a Beis ha'Kisei is even if there is no excrement inside, [the Isur to think about Torah in] a bathhouse is even if no one is inside!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Rafram permits praying facing a Beis ha'Kisei that was not used yet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Ravina never resolved whether or not designation for a Beis ha'Kisei takes effect (to make it like a Beis ha'Kisei)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His was unsure whether or not it is forbidden to pray <i>inside</i> it, but surely it is permitted to pray facing it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>(Persian latrines are sloped, so the excrement slides down to a place far from the person.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Even if there is excrement in a Persian latrine, it is considered sealed (and thus one may say Shema there).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>TAKANAS EZRA</i> FOR ONE WHO WAS ALREADY <i>TAMEI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following must immerse (before saying Divrei Torah): a Zav who saw Keri (had a seminal emission), a Nidah who discharged semen, and a woman who became Nidah after relations;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Ba'al Keri saw Zivah, does R. Yehudah require him to immerse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps R. Yehudah exempts only regarding a Zav who saw Keri, for the decree did not apply to him when he first became Tamei (and now immersion will not be Metaher him), but a Ba'al Keri who sees Zivah must immerse, for the decree applied to him from the beginning of his Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he does not distinguish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he exempts even a regular Ba'al Keri, and the Mishnah discusses a Zav to teach the extremity of Chachamim's opinion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> A woman who became Nidah after relations must immerse; R. Yehudah exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She is like a Ba'al Keri who sees Zivah (the decree applied to her from the beginning of her Tum'ah, and R. Yehudah exempts)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> If a Ba'al Keri sees Zivah, he must immerse;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah exempts.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK TEFILAS HA'SHACHAR</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE TIMES OF THE PRAYERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may pray Shacharis until Chatzos (midday);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, he may pray until four hours of the day. (Each hour is 1/12th of the length of the day. The authorities dispute whether the day is measured from dawn until nightfall (Tzeis ha'Kochavim), or from sunrise until sunset.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may pray Minchah until evening;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah allows until Plag ha'Minchah (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Ma'ariv is not Kavu'a (fixed; this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The time for Musaf is the entire day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>(R. Yehudah says, it is until seven hours of the day -- some delete this from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> The time (for Keri'as Shema) is [to finish] at sunrise, in order to mention Ge'ulah immediately before Shemoneh Esreh and pray during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to Vatikim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Vatikin finish the morning Shema at sunrise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In our Mishnah, no one permits Shacharis after Chatzos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But Rav Mari said in the name of R. Yochanan that if one mistakenly omitted Ma'ariv, he prays Shacharis twice; if one mistakenly omitted Shacharis, he prays Minchah twice!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is permitted to pray the entire day;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Before Chatzos, one is rewarded for praying in the proper time; after Chatzos, one gets reward for praying, but not for praying in the proper time.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>TASHLUMIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one mistakenly omitted Minchah, does he prays Ma'ariv twice?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one omitted Ma'ariv, he prays Shacharis twice -- but that is because the Tashlumim (compensation) is during the same (Halachic) day -- "va'Yehi Erev va'Yehi Voker Yom Echad" (here, the Tashlumim would be the next day);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Tefilos are in place of Korbanos -- if a Korban (with a fixed time) was not brought that day, there is no Tashlumim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since Tefilah is a request for mercy, one may pray at any time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna bar Yehudah citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one mistakenly omitted Minchah, he prays Ma'ariv twice; we do not equate this to a Korban, which may not be offered on a later day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Me'uvas Lo Yuchal Liskon" -- this refers to one who missed Keri'as Shema of the evening or morning, or Ma'ariv or Shacharis;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>(This explicitly opposes Rav Mari's teaching, and since one may not pray Tashlumim on the same day, all the more so there is no Tashlumim for Minchah the next day!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Chisaron Lo Yuchal Lehimanos" -- this is one who did not join his friends in doing a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> The Beraisa discusses one who intentionally omitted praying. (It teaches that <i>even</i> Ma'ariv and Shacharis, which have Tashlumim on the same day (if they were omitted unintentionally), have no Tashlumim if omitted willfully.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi):</span> The Beraisa says "omitted," it does not say "mistakenly."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one mistakenly omitted Minchah on Erev Shabbos, he prays twice (Gra - Ma'ariv of Shabbos) on Shabbos night;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If one mistakenly omitted Minchah on Shabbos, he prays two weekday Shemoneh Esrehs on Motza'i Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He says Havdalah in [the fourth Berachah of] the first Shemoneh Esreh, not of the second.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said Havdalah in the second and not in the first, he was Yotzei the second Tefilah, not the first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Since he did not say Havdalah in the first (this shows that he intended it to be the Tashlumim, which may not be said before praying the current obligatory prayer), it is as if he did not say the first Shemoneh Esreh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> If (in winter) one mistakenly omitted the mention of rain in the second Berachah or the request for rain in the ninth, he must repeat them (he returns to that Berachah, or, sometimes, he must start again from the beginning of Shemoneh Esreh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he mistakenly omitted Havdalah in the fourth Berachah, he does not go back, for he can say Havdalah later with wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Likewise, in Beraisa #1 the first Tefilah should be valid, for he can say Havdalah later!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>This is left difficult. (Rif, cited in Tosfos - we could answer that when he said Havdalah only in the second Shemoneh Esreh, this shows that he intended the first to be Tashlumim and the second for Ma'ariv; Tashlumim must be said only after the current obligation, therefore it was invalid.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>HOW THE <i>TEFILOS</i> WERE ENACTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> The Avos enacted the [three daily] Tefilos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> The Tefilos correspond to the Temidim (fixed daily Korbanos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Each of them is supported by a Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina - Beraisa #1):</span> Avraham enacted Shacharis -- "va'Yashkem Avraham ba'Boker El ha'Makom Asher Amad Sham"; "Amidah" refers to Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yitzchak enacted Minchah -- "va'Yetzei Yitzchak la'Su'ach ba'Sadeh"; "Sichah" refers to Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Yakov enacted Ma'ariv -- "va'Yifga ba'Makom va'Yalen Sham"; "Pegi'ah" refers to Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yehoshua ben Levi - Beraisa #2):</span> One may pray Shacharis until Chatzos, because the morning Tamid may be offered until then;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, he may pray until four hours, this is the latest time for the morning Tamid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may pray Minchah until evening, the latest time for the afternoon Tamid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah permits [only] until Plag ha'Minchah, the latest time for the afternoon Tamid (Pesachim 58a). (However, the afternoon Tamid was slaughtered at eight and a half hours of the day, Hakravah was completed at nine and a half hours -- this is the beginning of Minchah Katanah, not Plag ha'Minchah! Tosfos explains that R. Yehudah refers to the time when the Ketores is offered, for it says "Tikon Tefilasi Ketores Lefanecha.")</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is there no fixed time for Ma'ariv?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is because limbs (of Olos) and fats that were not consumed on the Mizbe'ach may be offered the entire night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the time for Musaf the entire day?</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>Minchah Gedolah (the earliest time that one may pray Minchah) begins at six and a half hours of the day (the earliest time to offer the afternoon Tamid);</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yehudah (who permits until Plag ha'Minchah) refer to the first half (of the time that Chachamim allow for Minchah), or the second half?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #3 - R. Yehudah):</span> One may pray until the latter Plag ha'Minchah, i.e. ten and three quarters hours.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Avos enacted the Tefilos, Chachamim associated them with Korbanos.</p>
