<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BLESSINGS IN THE MIKDASH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> R. Zerika did not say this explicitly, it was inferred from something he said:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zerika):</span> Since they said only one Berachah, this shows that the Berachos are not Me'akev each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We understand this if they blessed Yotzer Or -- they would not bless Ahavah Rabah at all, we indeed learn that the Berachos are not Me'akev each other;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But if they blessed Ahavah Rabah, this does not show that that the Berachos are not Me'akev each other -- perhaps they did not bless Yotzer Or because it was not yet time, and they would say it later in its time (when daylight comes)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make if it was inferred? (Surely, the inference is correct!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps they really blessed Ahavah Rabah, they would bless Yotzer Or in its time;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Zerika taught that the <i>order</i> of the Berachos is not Me'akev!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They would say Aseres ha'Dibros, Shema, v'Hayah Im Shamo'a, va'Yomer, Emes v'Yatziv, Avodah and Birkas Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Chachamim wanted to enact saying Aseres ha'Dibros with Keri'as Shema outside the Mikdash, but they abolished this on account of heretics (lest they say that Aseres ha'Dibros is the entire written Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> Chachamim wanted to enact saying Aseres ha'Dibros with Keri'as Shema outside the Mikdash, but they abolished this on account of heretics.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Two Amora'im wanted to enact saying Aseres ha'Dibros with Keri'as Shema -- Rabah bar bar Chanah in Sura, and Ameimar in Neharde'a. They were told by Rav Chisda and Rav Ashi that this was abolished on account of heretics.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Shabbos an extra Berachah was given to the departing Mishmar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Berachah was this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chelbo):</span> The departing Mishmar would bless the incoming Mishmar, "The One who made His name dwell in this house should put among you Ahavah (love), Achvah (brotherhood), Shalom (peace), and Re'us (companionship)."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS THE BEGINNING OR THE END OF A BLESSING THE PRIMARY PART?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Where Chachamim said that a long Berachah should be said...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The following is obvious:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one was holding a cup of wine, thinking that it was beer, and began to bless, intending to bless [she'Hakol Niheyeh bi'Devaro] for beer, and he [remembered that it is wine, and] blessed (Borei Peri ha'Gafen) for wine, he fulfilled his obligation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is clear, for even had he said she'Hakol, he would have fulfilled his obligation (b'Di'eved).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said she'Hakol Niheyeh bi'Devaro on anything, he fulfilled his obligation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one was holding a cup of beer, thinking that it was wine, and began to bless for wine, and he [remembered, and] blessed for beer, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we consider his original intent (to say Borei Peri ha'Gafen), he was not Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we consider only the end (he closed the Berachah with proper intent), he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> In the morning, if one began to say the blessing of Yotzer Or and concluded with ha'Ma'ariv Aravim, he was not Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he began to say ha'Ma'ariv Aravim and concluded Yotzer Or, he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the evening, if one began to say ha'Ma'ariv Aravim and concluded Yotzer Or, he was not Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he began to say Yotzer Or and concluded ha'Ma'ariv Aravim, he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The general rule is, it all depends on the Chasimah (end) of the Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> That is different, for the Chasimah itself ("Baruch Atah Hash-m Yotzer ha'Me'oros") is a full Berachah (whereas regarding she'Hakol, he says "Baruch" only once, and it was with mistaken intent)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Rav, who says that a Berachah without Hash-m's name is not a Berachah ("Baruch Atah Hash-m Yotzer ha'Me'oros" is a Berachah by itself);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Yochanan, a Berachah without [mention of Hash-m's] Malchus is not a Berachah, this does not reject the proof from the Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Rabah bar Ula taught, the Berachos were formulated to mention the attribute of day at night, and the attribute of night during the day -- therefore, the beginning of the Berachah, which includes Hash-m's name and Malchus, was proper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> The general rule is, it all depends on the Chasimah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does, "The general rule is," come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It includes our case (when he started to bless Borei Peri ha'Gafen on beer)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it includes bread and dates.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He ate bread, but thought that he ate dates, and began to bless with intent to say "Al ha'Etz...," and he [remembered, and] blessed [Birkas ha'Mazon]</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is just like our question (so our answer is valid)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He ate dates, but thought that he ate bread, and began to bless with intent to say Birkas ha'Mazon, and he [remembered, and] blessed "Al ha'Etz" -- he was Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>[We cannot resolve our question from this, because] even had he blessed Birkas ha'Mazon, he would have been Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Dates also give sustenance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Chinena Sava):</span> If one did not say Emes v'Yatziv in the morning, or Emes v'Emunah at night, he did not fulfill his obligation -- "l'Hagid ba'Boker Chasdecha (Emes v'Yatziv recounts many Chasadim that Hash-m did for us), ve'Emunascha ba'Leilos."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Chinena Sava and Shmuel citing Rav):</span> When one bows during Tefilah, he bends his knees at "Baruch" and straightens himself when saying "Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He learns from "Hash-m Zokef Kefufim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Mipnei Shmi Nichas Hu" (one should be submissive, i.e. bowed, when saying Hash-m's name!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It does not say "bi'Shmi" ("<i>when</i> saying My name"), but rather, "Mipnei Shmi" ("<i>before</i> saying My name).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Rav Sheshes would bow (at once), like a stick (that one raps on a table);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Aruch):</span> He would bow his body and head, like a weed called Chizra; (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He would straighten himself slowly, like a snake.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER TEACHINGS OF RABAH BAR CHINENA SAVA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Chinena Sava):</span> One always closes the third and eleventh Berachos of Shemoneh Esreh with "ha'Kel ha'Kadosh" and "Melech Ohev Tzedakah u'Mishpat," except during the ten days of Teshuvah, when one says "ha'Melech ha'Kadosh" and "ha'Melech ha'Mishpat."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Even if one said "ha'Kel ha'Kadosh" he was Yotzei -- "va'Yigbah Hash-m Tzevakos ba'Mishpat veha'Kel ha'Kadosh Nikdash bi'Tzedakah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is Hash-m exalted in judgment?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is during the ten days of Teshuvah, and He is still called "ha'Kel ha'Kadosh"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> One always says "ha'Kel ha'Kadosh" and "Melech Ohev Tzedakah u'Mishpat."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> During the ten days of Teshuvah one says "ha'Melech ha'Kadosh" and "ha'Melech ha'Mishpat."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Halachah follows Rabah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Chinena Sava):</span> If one is able to pray for someone else and does not, he is called a sinner -- "... Chalilah Li me'Chato la'Shem me'Chadol l'Hispalel Ba'adchem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One must pain himself to the point of becoming sick on account of a Chacham (who needs mercy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He learns from "v'Ein Choleh Mikem Alai v'Goleh Es Azni" (they should have become sick over Shaul's plight).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps this applies only for a king!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "va'Ani ba'Chalosam Levushi...." (Maharsha - "u'Sefilasi Al Cheiki Sashuv," I will become sick through this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Chinena Sava):</span> If one sins and is embarrassed about it, all of his sins are forgiven -- "Lema'an Tizkeri va'Vosht... b'Chapri Lach l'Chol Asher Asisa."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That refers to the Tzibur, perhaps we cannot learn to an individual!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we learn from Shaul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Elokim Sar me'Alai v'Lo Anani Od Gam b'Yad ha'Nevi'im Gam ba'Chalamos" -- he did not mention that he was not answered through the Urim v'Tumim, because he was ashamed that he killed the Kohanim in Nov;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that his sins were pardoned?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> Shmuel told him, "u'Machar Atah u'Vanecha Imi" -- you will be in Gan Eden tomorrow (you will not need to endure punishment in Gehinom), in my place (surely, one of the highest rewards there is!).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabanan):</span> "Ve'Hoka'anum la'Shem b'Giv'as Shaul <i>Bechir Hash-m</i>" -- [the Giv'onim were bitter, surely they did not call him Hash-m's chosen, rather,] a Bas Kol said this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN SHEMA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu ben Zutarti):</span> Chachamim wanted to make Parshas Balak part of Keri'as Shema; they did not, for it would burden the Tzibur (it is very long).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they want to make it part of Shema?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It mentions "Kel Motzi'am mi'Mitzrayim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, we should say the Parshah of Ribis and unjust weights, which also mention Yetzi'as Mitzrayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Avin):</span> It is because it mentions "Kara Shachav ka'Ari uch'Lavi Mi Yekimenu" (like "uv'Shochbecha uv'Kumecha").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, they should have enacted to say just this verse (it would not be a burden)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We have a tradition, we do not split (recite only part of) a Parshah in the Torah. (The "Parshiyos" we refer to are divided by spaces in the Torah; they are delineated by the letters "Samech" or "Pei" in the Chumash.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Chachamim make Parshas Tzitzis part of Keri'as Shema?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah bar Chavivi):</span> It contains five things -- the Mitzvah of Tzitzis, Yetzi'as Mitzrayim, Ol (the yoke of) Mitzvos, prohibitions against heresy, thoughts of sin, and idolatry (Tosfos ha'Rosh - this is the same as heresy, so there are only five things.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Three of these are explicit -- Ol Mitzvos ("u'Zechartem Es Kol Mitzvosai"), Tzitzis and Yetzi'as Mitzrayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Where do we find heresy, thoughts of sin and idolatry?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Acharei Levavchem" refers to heresy -- "Amar Naval b'Libo Ein Elokim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Acharei Eineichem" refers to thoughts of sin; "Atem Zonim" refers to idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We [recite the third Parshah of Shema, and thereby] mention Yetzi'as Mitzrayim [even] at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Elazar ben Azaryah says, I am like a man of 70, yet I was never able to prove that we mention Yetzi'as Mitzrayim at night until Ben Zoma expounded:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lema'an Tizkor Es Yom Tzeischa me'Eretz Mitzrayim Kol Yemei Chayecha" -- "Yemei Chayecha" refers to daytime, "<i>Kol</i> Yemei Chayecha" includes the nights;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, "Yemei Chayecha" refers to this world, "Kol Yemei Chayecha" includes the World to Come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Ben Zoma):</span> Will we mention Yetzi'as Mitzrayim in the World to Come?! It says "Hineh Yamim Ba'im... v'Lo Yomru Od... Asher He'elah Bnei Yisrael me'Eretz Mitzrayim Ki Im... Asher He'elah... me'Eretz Tzafonah umi'Kol ha'Aratzos"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We will still mention Yetzi'as Mitzrayim, just it will be secondary to the final redemption.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Similarly -- "Lo Yikarei Shimcha Od Yakov Ki Im Yisrael" -- he is still called Yakov (at times), just his primary name is Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>[In the future,] "Al Tizkeru Rishonos" -- do not mention the redemptions from the kingdoms (of Bavel, Madai and Yavan), "v'Kadmoniyos Al Tisbonenu" -- do not <i>contemplate</i> Yetzi'as Mitzrayim (but you will mention it).</p>
