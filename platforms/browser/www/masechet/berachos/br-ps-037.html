<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> One blesses Borei Minei Mezonos on anything <i>containing</i> the five grains.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> One blesses Borei Minei Mezonos on anything <i>from</i> the five grains.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They must teach both of them:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had they taught only the latter, one might have thought that this is only when it is totally made of grain, but not a mixture;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had they only taught the former, one might have thought that one blesses Borei Minei Mezonos only for a mixture of the five grains, not for a mixture of rice or millet, but one blesses Borei Minei Mezonos for something totally made of rice or millet; therefore, they taught anything <i>from</i> the five grains, to exclude even something totally from rice or millet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do bless Borei Minei Mezonos for rice or millet!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One blesses before and after bread of rice or millet like one blesses for cooked foods;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> One blesses Borei Minei Mezonos before cooked foods, and one Berachah me'Ein Shalosh (i.e. Al ha'Michyah, which is in place of the three mid'Oraisa blessings of Birkas ha'Mazon) afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #1 teaches that one blesses before and after bread of rice or millet, <i>just as</i> one blesses before and after cooked foods, but the blessings are different;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One blesses Borei Minei Mezonos before cooked foods and me'Ein Shalosh afterwards, but one blesses sheha'Kol before rice and Borei Nefashos Rabos v'Chesronam afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But rice is considered a cooked food!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> [Regarding Berachos,] the following are cooked foods -- [products of] Chilka, Tragis, Zariz, Arsan (the wheat kernels broken into two, three, four and five pieces, respectively), Soles (fine flour), and rice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa is like R. Yochanan ben Nuri, but Chachamim disagree.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> Rice is a grain, if it became Chametz one is Chayav Kares for eating it on Pesach, one may fulfill the Mitzvah of Matzah with rice Matzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim agree that rice is considered a cooked food!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One who eats wheat blesses Borei Pri ha'Adamah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was ground (into flour), baked and cooked:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the pieces are intact, one blesses ha'Motzi (beforehand) and Birkas ha'Mazon (afterwards);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If the pieces are not intact, one blesses Borei Minei Mezonos and me'Ein Shalosh.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If it was ground, baked and cooked, even if the pieces are intact, one blesses Borei Minei Mezonos and me'Ein Shalosh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be R. Yochanan ben Nuri -- he holds that rice is a grain, and if the pieces are intact one blesses ha'Motzi and Birkas ha'Mazon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav and Shmuel are refuted.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Beraisa #1 is Chachamim, Beraisa #2 is R. Yehudah (who requires very specific Berachos):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Yerek we say Borei Pri ha'Adamah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, we say Borei Minei Desha'im.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Rav Sheshes):</span> Beraisa #1 is like R. Gamliel, Beraisa #3 is like Chachamim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #4 - R. Gamliel):</span> The general rule is, one says Birkas ha'Mazon after anything from the seven species;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, one says me'Ein Shalosh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A case occurred, R. Gamliel and Chachamim ate dates; R. Gamliel authorized R. Akiva to bless (for everyone) -- he blessed me'Ein Shalosh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> Why do you enter arguments?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Rebbi, you taught me that the Halachah follows the majority!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Yehudah says, anything from the seven species other than grain, or grain that was not baked into bread, R. Gamliel obligates Birkas ha'Mazon, Chachamim obligate me'Ein Shalosh;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">37b----------------------------------------37b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Anything not from the seven species, such as bread of rice or millet, R. Gamliel obligates me'Ein Shalosh, Chachamim do not obligate [any blessing afterwards] at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot establish Beraisa #1 to be R. Gamliel, on account of the Seifa of the Reisha (regarding the five grains)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If the pieces are not intact, one blesses Borei Minei Mezonos and me'Ein Shalosh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is not like R. Gamliel -- he obligates Birkas ha'Mazon for dates and porridge, all the more so cooked bread (even if the pieces are not intact)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, it must be Chachamim:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> If it is Chachamim, they contradict themselves (Beraisa #1 obligates me'Ein Shalosh after rice, in Beraisa #4 Chachamim do not obligate anything)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is Chachamim -- we must fix the text of Beraisa #1 to say that one does not bless at all after rice.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Chavitz of villagers has much flour, one blesses on it Borei Minei Mezonos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The flour is primary.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Chavitz of city dwellers has little flour, one blesses on it sheha'Kol;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The honey is primary.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> The blessing after both of them is Borei Minei Mezonos, for Rav and Shmuel say that one blesses Borei Minei Mezonos on anything containing the five grains.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Regarding Chavitza (fried pieces of bread):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If some of the pieces are at least a k'Zayis, one blesses ha'Motzi and Birkas ha'Mazon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If all the pieces are less than a k'Zayis, one blesses Borei Minei Mezonos and me'Ein Shalosh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> I learn from a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen (Tosfos; Rashi - Yisrael) was offering a Minchah for the first time (in his life; alternatively, the first time this year, i.e. from Chadash), he blesses Shehecheyanu;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he eats it, he blesses ha'Motzi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Every Minchah is broken into pieces the size of olives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael says that they are broken very finely, like flour -- surely, Kohanim would bless ha'Motzi!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they do not bless ha'Motzi!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> If one gathered a k'Zayis of bread crumbs (Rashi - from different Menachos; Tosfos - of the five grains) and ate it (on Pesach):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they are Matzah, he fulfills his obligation (they are considered "Lechem");</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If they are Chametz, he is Chayav Kares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, he combined them into one mass.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> This is when he ate "them" within Kedei Achilas Pras (the time to eat half a loaf).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he combined them into one mass, it should say that he ate "it"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, [a k'Zayis of] the loaf (from which the crumbs came) is still intact. (Since it retains its importance and its blessing, its crumbs retain their blessing.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> One blesses ha'Motzi on Chavitza, even if all the pieces are less than a k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is only if they still look like bread.</p>
