<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO MAY BE PART OF A <i>ZIMUN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If three people ate [bread] together, they must be Mezamen (add a preface to Birkas ha'Mazon, and one of them must say at least the first blessing of Birkas ha'Mazon for all of them to hear);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The following count towards the three for a Zimun:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who ate Demai (doubtfully tithed produce), Ma'aser Rishon from which Terumah was taken, or Ma'aser Sheni or Hekdesh that was redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A waiter who ate a k'Zayis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Kusi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The following do not count towards the three:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who ate Tevel (untithed produce), Ma'aser Rishon from which Terumah was not taken, or Ma'aser Sheni or Hekdesh that was not redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A waiter who ate less than a k'Zayis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We do not include women, slaves or children in a Zimun;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much must one eat to be included in a Zimun?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He must eat at least a k'Zayis;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> He must eat at least a k'Beitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source (that three may bless together)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Asi):</span> We learn from "Gadlu la'Shem Iti u'Neromemah Shemo Yachdav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Avahu):</span> We learn from "Ki Shem Hash-m Ekra Havu Godel l'Elokeinu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanan bar Aba):</span> What is the source that one who answers "Amen" may not answer louder than the one who blessed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Gadlu la'Shem Iti u'Neromemah Shemo Yachdav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> What is the source that one who translates [to Aramaic during Keri'as haTorah] may not speak louder than the one who reads the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Moshe Yedaber veha'Elokim Ya'anenu v'Kol";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Torah need to say "v'Kol"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Hash-m spoke as loud as Moshe. (Tosfos - after the first two Dibros, Hash-m was speaking to Moshe, and Moshe was broadcasting for Yisrael to hear. We must say that Hash-m spoke as loud as Moshe because it was forbidden for Moshe to speak louder than Hash-m.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One who translates may not speak louder than the one who reads the verse (Rambam - and the reader may not speak louder than the translator);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the translator cannot speak as loud as the reader, the reader should lower his voice.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A <i>ZIMUN</i> WITH TWO PEOPLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or R. Yochanan):</span> If two people ate together, they may make a Zimun if they want;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and R. Yochanan):</span> They may not make a Zimun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If three people ate together, they must make a Zimun.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Three make a Zimun, not two!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Three must make a Zimun, two have permission (to make a Zimun if they want).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If three ate together, they must make a Zimun, they may not divide (and bless individually). (If two may make a Zimun, one of the three should be allowed to leave, for the others will still be able to make a Zimun!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There making a Zimun is different -- since they were obligated to make a Zimun, it is not enough to make a Zimun in a way that is optional (i.e. with two).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a waiter was serving two people, he may eat without permission (surely, they want him to eat, to enable them to make a Zimun);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was serving three, he must ask permission to eat (since they can make a Zimun without him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though two have permission to make a Zimun, they want him to eat, to enable them to make an obligatory Zimun.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Women make a Zimun by themselves, slaves make a Zimun by themselves, women, slaves and children may not make a Zimun together.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Many women are like two men (they are not obligated to make a Zimun), and it says that Zimun is optional!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Granted, many women are not obligated to make a Zimun, but perhaps the permission to make a Zimun depends on number (we need three, in order to fulfill "Gadlu (plural) la'Shem Iti," i.e. one asks at least two others to bless with him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> Women, slaves and children may not make a Zimun together.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why shouldn't they, if there are three? (Tosfos deletes "I'Hachi" from the text, for this question does not depend on the previous answer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They do not make a Zimun together on account of immorality.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The following shows that Rav holds that two may not make a Zimun:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi bar Yosef citing Rav):</span> If three ate together and one went out to the market, we call to him; [if he does not come,] we make a Zimun on [account of] him (in his absence).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The other two could not make a Zimun without calling him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since they were obligated to make a Zimun, it is not enough to make a Zimun in a way that is optional.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The following shows that R. Yochanan holds that two may not make a Zimun:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> If two ate together, one may be Yotzei (fulfill his obligation to bless) by listening to the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know this from a Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one heard [a blessing] and did not answer, he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> R. Yochanan teaches that they do not make a Zimun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Affirmation:</span> Indeed, he must hold that two may not make a Zimun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> But Rabanan that come from Eretz Yisrael (to Bavel) say that two may make a Zimun;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Presumably, they heard this from R. Yochanan, the biggest Chacham of Eretz Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> No, they heard this from Rav before Rav came to Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>JOINING FOR A <i>ZIMUN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi bar Yosef citing Rav):</span> If three ate together and one went out to the market, we call to him, and (if he does not come) we make a Zimun on behalf of him (in his absence).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is only if he can hear the Zimun and answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> This applies only to a Zimun of three, but one cannot be counted for a Zimun of ten (to say "Baruch Elokeinu") unless he comes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> To the contrary -- nine look like ten (we are not concerned if one does not come), but two do not look like three!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Halachah follows Mar Zutra.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is improper to mention Hash-m's name with less than ten.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Halachah is if two ate together, each should bless by himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If two ate together, each should bless by himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is if both are Chachamim; if one is a Chacham and the other an ignoramus, the ignoramus should be Yotzei by listening to the Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava and R. Zeira):</span> If three ate together (and two finished), the third must stop [eating to hear Birkas ha'Zimun; if one finished], two need not stop for one (he must wait for them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Papa (and another person) stopped for his son Aba Mar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Papa went beyond the letter of the law, he was not required to do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Yehudah bar Mereimar, Mar bar Rav Ashi and Rav Acha mi'Difti ate together; normally, the most important one is Motzi the others -- none of them was more important than the others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If three people ate together, they must make a Zimun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>They thought that perhaps this is only if one of them is more distinguished, but if all are equal, each should bless by himself; they did so, and asked Mereimar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Mereimar:</span> You fulfilled Birkas ha'Mazon, but you did not fulfill [your obligation to say] Birkas ha'Zimun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they can say it now!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Zimun may not be made retroactively (after Birkas ha'Mazon).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ANSWERING TO BLESSINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one finds people saying Birkas ha'Zimun, what should he answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zevid):</span> He should say, "Baruch u'Mevorach";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> He should answer, "Amen."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>They do not argue -- if one hears them saying, "Let us bless," he answers, "Baruch u'Mevorach"; if one hears them saying Baruch, he answers "Amen."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> It is praiseworthy to answer "Amen" after one's own blessing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> It is disdainful.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> It is praiseworthy regarding Boneh Yerushalayim (in Birkas ha'Mazon -- we will explain why), it is disdainful regarding any other blessing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye would answer "Amen" (after he said Boneh Yerushalayim) loudly in order that workers would hear it and return to work;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They do not stay to hear ha'Tov veha'Metiv (the fourth blessing of Birkas ha'Mazon), for it is only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Ashi would answer "Amen" quietly, lest people sense that ha'Tov veha'Metiv is only mid'Rabanan and treat it lightly.</p>
