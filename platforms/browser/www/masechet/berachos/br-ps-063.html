<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>REVERENCE OF HASH-M'S BEIS HA'MIKDASH, NAME, AND TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> I meant, we should forbid [spitting] in Har ha'Bayis and in a synagogue:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is forbidden to enter Har ha'Bayis with shoes, all the more so it is forbidden to spit there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is permitted to enter a synagogue with shoes; rather than learn from shoes to permit spitting there, we should learn [to forbid this] from the prohibition of making a synagogue a shortcut!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The law of a synagogue is like one's house -- one is particular not to let people use his house for a shortcut, yet he is not particular about spitting or wearing shoes there; likewise, one may not use a synagogue for a shortcut, yet one may spit and wear shoes there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In the Mikdash, they used to end all blessings... [with "Ad (or Min) ha'Olam..."]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is there such a lengthy closing?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is because we do not answer "Amen" in the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says, "Kumu Barchu Es Hash-m Elokeichem Min ha'Olam v'Ad ha'Olam," and "vi'Varchu Shem Kevodecha u'Merumam Al Kol Berachah u'Sehilah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one Tehilah (praise) after all the Berachos (e.g. of Shemoneh Esreh) suffices!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "U'Merumam Al Kol Berachah u'Sehilah" -- there is a Tehilah for each Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chachamim enacted that one may (alternatively, must) greet people with Hash-m's name -- "va'Yomer (Bo'az) la'Kotzrim..."; it also says "Hash-m Imcha..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>(Me'iri - this was enacted so people will know that Shalom and all blessings come from Hash-m.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need the other verses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Bo'az did so on his own initiative, and we may not learn from him -- therefore, we need "Hash-m Imcha...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from there -- perhaps this was not a greeting, but rather the angel informed Gid'on that Hash-m was with him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Therefore, we learn from "v'Al Tavuz Ki Zaknah Imecha" (do not suspect Chachamim (like Bo'az) of acting improperly);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They have authority to make such enactments -- "Es La'asos la'Shem Heferu Torasecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We can expound this verse in either direction:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can expound from Reisha to Seifa -- there are times when Hash-m must punish because people transgressed His Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We can expound from Seifa to Reisha -- people who fear Hash-m needed to transgress His Torah at times, for His sake (to impede a breach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Hillel):</span> When [Chachamim] withdraw (do not disseminate Torah), disseminate; when they disseminate, withdraw (humble yourself and refrain from teaching -- this is an annulment of Torah, l'Shem Shamayim - Rashi; Maharsha - the next clause is the explanation of this one);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If you see that the generation values Torah, disseminate -- "Yesh Mefazer v'Nosaf Od";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the generation does not value Torah, refrain -- "Es La'asos la'Shem Heferu Torasecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Bar Kapara:</span> If merchandise is cheap, buy (for later it will be expensive); in a place where there are no men (issuing Halachic rulings), you should be a man. (Maharsha - the Mishnah in Avos (2:6), "In a place where there are no men, strive to be a man," refers to doing the needs of the Tzibur.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Inference (Abaye):</span> In a place where there is a man, you should not be a man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious (one may not issue Halachic rulings in the same place as his Rebbi)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even if one is as qualified as the Rebbi, he should not issue rulings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Bar Kapara):</span> One small passage is the basis of all the fundamentals of Torah -- "b'Chol Derachecha Da'ehu v'Hu Yeyasher Orchosecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This applies even to [times when one may serve Hash-m through] an Aveirah (such as when Eliyahu offered a Korban of Shechutei Chutz on Har ha'Karmel).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>SEGULOS</i> FOR WEALTH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Bar Kapara):</span> One should teach his son a trade that is easy (does not require major investment) and clean (from temptation to steal - Aruch).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is such a trade?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Embroidery of a shirt (Rashi; Meturgeman - a tailor who can fix tears with a small needle) is such a trade.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> One should not have too many friends in his house -- "Ish Re'im l'Hisro'e'a."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> One should not appoint an overseer in his house -- had Potifar not appointed Yosef as overseer, the episode [with Potifar's wife] would not have occurred.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Parshas Nazir is written next to Parshas Sotah to teach that anyone who sees a Sotah in her disgrace should become a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah brei d'R. Parnach):</span> Parshas Sotah is written next to "v'Ish Es Kodashav Lo Yiheyeh," a command to give Terumos and Ma'aseros, to teach that anyone who has them and does not give them to a Kohen will ultimately need the Kohen to give his wife the waters of Sotah to drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Further, one who does not give Terumos and Ma'aseros will ultimately need them (i.e. to receive Ma'aser Ani, he will be poor) -- "v'Ish Es Kodashav Lo Yiheyeh" (if he keeps them for himself, they will be appropriate for him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> If he gives them, he will become wealthy -- "Ish Asher Yiten la'Kohen <i>Lo Yiheyeh</i>" -- he will have much wealth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Berachyah):</span> If one joins Hash-m's name to his troubles (blesses "Dayan ha'Emes"; alternatively, prays for mercy), his income will be doubled -- "v'Hayah Shakai b'Tzarecha v'Chesef <i>To'afos</i> Lach" (this connotes double);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> His income will fly ("Me'ofefes," i.e. come easily) like [that of] a bird -- "v'Chesef <i>To'afos</i> Lach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tavi):</span> If one slackens from Torah, he will not have strength to endure a difficult day -- "Hisrapisa b'Yom Tzarah Tzar Kochecha";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami bar Masna):</span> This applies even if he slackens from one Mitzvah -- "Hisrapisa" connotes any slackening.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>EXPECTED CONDUCT OF CHACHAMIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> When Chananyah (R. Yehoshua's nephew) went to Chutz la'Aretz to establish leap years and determine months (i.e. which day is Rosh Chodesh), two Chachamim, R. Yosi ben Kiper and the grandson of Zecharyah ben Kevutal, were sent to protest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(Rashi - we establish leap years only in Yehudah, as we learn from "l'Shichno Sidreshu" -- all "Derishos" must be in the place of the Shechinah (Yerushalayim).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chananyah:</span> Why did you come?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The Chachamim:</span> We came to learn Torah [with you].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chananyah announced, "These are Gedolei ha'Dor; also, their ancestors served in the Mikdash!"</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Zecharyah ben Kevutal):</span> I often read in front of the Kohen Gadol [on the night of Yom Kipur, so he would not fall asleep] from Sefer Daniel (which is in Aramaic; many ignorant Kohanim Gedolim during the times of the second Beis ha'Mikdash were not fluent in Hebrew).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>What Chananyah was Metamei, the Chachamim were Metaher; what he forbade, they permitted. He announced, "These people are false and empty!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> You called us Gedolei ha'Dor -- you cannot retract!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Chananyah:</span> Why do you contradict what I teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> This is because you are establishing leap years and determining months in Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Chananyah:</span> R. Akiva did so (surely, it is permitted)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> He was permitted to so so, for there was no one left in Eretz Yisrael as great as he.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Chananyah:</span> I, too, did not leave anyone in Eretz Yisrael as great as I!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The budding Chachamim you left behind grew and surpassed you, and sent us to tell you:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If you will stop, good; if not, you will be excommunicated;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We must tell people here not to heed you -- if they refuse, they should go to a mountain, Achiyah [the leader of the Diaspora] will build a Mizbe'ach, Chananyah will sing, everyone will deny Hash-m and say, "We have no share in the G-d of Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span>Everyone cried out, "Of course we have a share in the G-d of Yisrael!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why were the Chachamim so adamant about Chananyah? (Maharsha - "l'Shichno Sidreshu" applies only at the time of Shechinah, when the Mikdash stands.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Even nowadays, this must be done in Eretz Yisrael, unless the greatest sage is in Chutz la'Aretz.) "Ki mi'Tziyon Tetzei Torah u'Devar Hash-m mi'Yerushalayim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand that they could be Metamei what he was Metaher, they are more stringent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, they could not be Metaher what he was Metamei, for this is a leniency!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Chacham declares something to be Tamei or forbidden, another Chacham may not be Metaher or permit it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There was a special need to undermine his authority, lest others be drawn after him. (They disagreed only where he was stringent beyond the letter of the law.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When the Chachamim came to Yavneh (the Sanhedrin moved to Yavneh at the time of the Churban), they praised those who host guests:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(The Roman empire decreed that R. Yehudah should always speak first, for he once praised them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah opened with the honor of [those who learn] Torah -- "u'Moshe Yikach Es ha'Ohel v'Nata Lo mi'Chutz la'Machaneh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(Moshe called his tent "Ohel Mo'ed," for it was a meeting place for seekers of Torah. After the sin of the golden calf, he distanced it from the encampment of Yisrael (until the Mishkan was erected). If the Rebbi (Hash-m) is angry at them, the Talmid (Moshe) should also show displeasure. The Aron in the next statement is the Aron that Moshe made before receiving the second Luchos (Devarim 10-1), and not Betzalel's Aron which was in the Mishkan.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Aron (of Moshe) was only 12 Mil (one Mil is 2000 Amos) away [from people at the furthest end of] the encampment of Yisrael, and yet it says, "Kol Mevakesh Hash-m Yetzei El Ohel Mo'ed";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim who go from city to city and from country to country to learn Torah, all the more so [they are called "Mevakshei Hash-m," those who seek Hash-m]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yitzchak):</span> "V'Diber Hash-m El Moshe Panim El Panim" -- Hash-m told Moshe, "We will learn Halachah together pleasantly." (Ben Yehoyada - Hash-m allowed Moshe to say Chidushim in Torah and receive reward for deriving the correct Halachah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Hash-m told Moshe, "Just as I taught you pleasantly, so you shall teach them; return the Ohel Mo'ed to its place."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> "V'Shav El ha'Machaneh" -- Hash-m told Moshe, "If Yisrael will say that both the Rebbi and Talmid are angry at them, what will happen to them (they will not grow in learning)? If you return the tent, fine; if not, Yehoshua, your Talmid, will serve (as Rebbi) in place of you."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This explains "v'Shav El ha'Machaneh" (it was a command).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Even though Moshe returned, Hash-m's suggestion regarding Yehoshua was not for naught (he was the successor to Moshe; Rashi's text omits the end of the verse) -- "u'Mesharso Yehoshua... Lo Yamish mi'Toch ha'Ohel."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Yehudah expounded more about the honor of Torah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Haskes u'Shema Yisrael ha'Yom ha'Zeh Niheyesa l'Am" -- Torah was not given that day, this was said at the end of the 40 years in the Midbar!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that to those who learn Torah, every day it is as dear to them as the day it was given on Sinai</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Tanchum brei d'R. Chiya):</span> If a person recites Shema every morning and evening, and one evening he does not recite it, it is as if he never said it (Maharsha - he did not fulfill "v'Hayu ha'Devarim ha'Eleh...," to consider Divrei Torah as if they were just given now).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>"Haskes" -- [we expound this like] "Asu Kitos" (make groups to learn together), for Torah is acquired only in groups:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> What does it mean "Cherev El <i>ha'Badim</i> v'No'alu"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A sword should come upon the enemies of (a euphemism) Chachamim who learn Bad b'Vad (individually);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Moreover, they become foolish; it says "v'No'alu," like "Asher No'alnu" (regarding the Lashon ha'Ra spoken about Moshe);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Moreover, they sin; we learn from "[Asher No'alnu] va'Asher Chatanu," or from "No'alu Sarei Tzo'an."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Also - "Haskes u'Shema Yisrael" -- [we expound this as] "Kesusum" (break yourselves over Divrei Torah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Zos ha'Torah Adam Ki Yamus b'Ohel" -- Divrei Torah endure only in one who kills himself [has nothing to do with the world, except] for Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>"Haskes" -- first, a person should be "Has" (silent, and listen), then "Kastes" (grind, i.e. challenge and analyze the teachings);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> First one should learn (the text from his Rebbi); afterwards, he should delve deeper into it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Bei R. Yanai):</span> What does "Ki Mitz Chalav Yotzi Chem'ah..." mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The cream of Torah is found in one who vomits out the milk he nursed (Maharsha - he abandons childish pleasures) for its sake;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"U'Mitz Af Yotzi Dam" -- if the Talmid is silent when his Rebbi gets angry at him the first time, he merits to distinguish between Tahor blood and Tamei blood;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"U'Mitz Apayim Yotzi Riv" -- if he is silent the first two times his Rebbi gets angry at him, he merits to understand both monetary and capital laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> To become a Chacham, one should study monetary laws, it is the greatest field in Torah, it is like a flowing spring;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> What do we learn from "Im Navalta v'Hisnasei v'Im Zamosa Yad la'Peh"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Anyone who is Menavel (disgraces) himself for the sake of Torah (he asks about everything he is unsure about, even though people mock him for this) will ultimately be praised;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he muzzled himself (did not ask), he will have to cover his mouth with his hand (he will be unable to answer questions).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span>R. Nechemyah expounded about the greatness of hosts:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "va'Yomer Shaul El ha'Keini Lechu Suru Redu mi'Toch Amakeki... v'Atah Asisa Chesed Im Kol Bnei Yisrael"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches a Kal va'Chomer -- Yisro provided for Moshe (Rashi - when Yisro came to the encampment of Yisrael in the desert; Maharsha - when Moshe fled to Midyan) for his own honor, yet this is considered doing Chesed for Yisrael -- all the more so, one who hosts a Talmid Chacham, gives him to eat and drink and lets him benefit from his property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span>R. Yosi expounded about the greatness of hosts:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lo Sesa'ev Adomi Ki Achicha Hu, Lo Sesa'ev Mitzri Ki Ger Hayisa v'Artzo" -- we may learn a Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Mitzrayim welcomed Yisrael for their own benefit -- "v'Im Yadata v'Yesh Bam Anshei Chayil v'Samtam Sarei Mikneh Al Asher Li" -- still, we must appreciate this [and not hate them], all the more so one who gives to a Talmid Chacham lodging, food, drink and benefit from his property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(v)</span>R. Eliezer, son of R. Yosi ha'Glili, expounded about the greatness of hosts:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Yevarech Hash-m Es Oved Edom... Ba'avor Aron ha'Elokim" -- we may learn a Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Aron did not eat or drink, he (Oved Edom) merely cleaned the floor [from dust] in front of it, and for this he was blessed -- all the more so one who gives to a Talmid Chacham lodging, food, drink and benefit from his property [will be blessed]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(w)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What blessing did he receive?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(x)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah bar Zevida):</span> His wife and eight daughters-in-law all gave birth to six babies in one delivery -- "Pe'ulasai ha'Shemini Ki Vercho Elokim; Kol Eleh... Shishim u'Shenayim l'Oved Edom" (54 new babies and his eight sons from before).</p>
