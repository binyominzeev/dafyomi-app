<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If one did not mention "Eretz Chemdah u'Tovah" in Birkas ha'Aretz, or "Malchus Beis David" in Boneh Yerushalayim, he does not fulfill his obligation;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Nachum the elder says, one must mention Bris [Milah] (in Birkas ha'Aretz, for in the merit of the Mitzvah of Bris Milah, Eretz Yisrael was promised to Avraham);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, one must mention Torah (in Birkas ha'Aretz, for in this merit Yisrael received Eretz Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Flimo says, one must mention Bris before Torah, for there are three covenants to keep the Torah, while there are thirteen [mentions of "Bris"] regarding circumcision.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Aba says, one must thank Hash-m at the beginning and end of Birkas ha'Aretz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At least, he must say one expression of thanks -- less than this is reproachful.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who ends Birkas ha'Aretz with "[Baruch Atah Hash-m] Who bequeaths lands," or ends Boneh Yerushalayim with "Who saves Yisrael" is unlearned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If one did not mention Bris and Torah in Birkas ha'Aretz, or Malchus Beis David in Boneh Yerushalayim, he did not fulfill his obligation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This supports R. Ila'a:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila'a):</span> If one did not mention Bris and Torah in Birkas ha'Aretz, or Malchus Beis David in Boneh Yerushalayim, he did not fulfill his obligation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Aba Yosi ben Dosta'i or Rabanan):</span> One must mention Malchus (Hash-m's kingship) in ha'Tov veha'Metiv;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Aba Yosi ben Dosta'i and Rabanan):</span> One need not mention Malchus in ha'Tov veha'Metiv.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first opinion holds that ha'Tov veha'Metiv is mid'Rabanan (thus it is an independent Berachah by itself, therefore it needs Malchus);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The latter opinion holds that it is mid'Oraisa (it is next to the previous Berachos of Birkas ha'Mazon, Malchus in the first Berachah suffices for all of the Berachos).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE CLOSING OF <i>BONEH YERUSHALAYIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> How do we end the blessing of Boneh Yerushalayim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Yehudah):</span> We end "[Baruch Atah Hash-m] Who saves Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Do we say "Who saves Yisrael" and not "Boneh Yerushalayim"?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, we also say "Who saves Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>(We normally begin Boneh Yerushalayim with two requests, for mercy on Yisrael and Yerushalayim.) Rabah bar Rav Huna visited the Reish Galusa; he began with one request, and ended with two [praises -- "Who saves Yisrael" and "Boneh Yerushalayim").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> It is improper to end with two!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> We do not end with two.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Levi asked Rebbi all the following questions, in which we end a Berachah with two praises.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [We end Birkas ha'Aretz,] "Al ha'Aretz v'Al ha'Mazon"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is really one praise, for the land which produces food.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [We end me'Ein Shalosh for fruits] "Al ha'Aretz v'Al Peroseha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is for the land which produces fruits.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [On Yom Tov, in Shemoneh Esreh and Kidush we end Kedushas ha'Yom] "Mekadesh Yisrael veha'Zemanim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m is Mekadesh Yisrael, Yisrael are Mekadesh the festivals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [On Rosh Chodesh, in Musaf we end Kedushas ha'Yom] "Mekadesh Yisrael v'Roshei Chodashim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m sanctifies Yisrael, Yisrael sanctifies the months.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [When Yom Tov is on Shabbos, we end Kidush and Kedushas ha'Yom] "Mekadesh ha'Shabbos v'Yisrael veha'Zemanim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> That is the one exception.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it different?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here, it is basically one praise -- Hash-m is the One who sanctifies;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Who saves Yisrael" and "Boneh Yerushalayim" are two distinct praises.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we end with two?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is like doing Mitzvos in bundles.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> If one began Boneh Yerushalayim with "Rachem Al Amcha Yisrael," he ends "Who saves Yisrael"; if one began "Rachem Al Yerushalayim," he ends "Boneh Yerushalayim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> Even if he began "Rachem Al Amcha Yisrael," he ends "Boneh Yerushalayim" (because these are connected).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Boneh Yerushalayim Hash-m Nidchei Yisrael Yechanes" -- Hash-m will rebuild Yerushalayim when He [has mercy on Yisrael and] gathers Yisrael from their dispersion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira (to Rav Chisda):</span> Come, we will learn [Mishnayos] together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> I don't even know Birkas ha'Mazon, I am not fit to learn!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> What do you mean?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> I said Birkas ha'Mazon in the Reish Galusa's house; Rav Sheshes strongly criticized me, for I did not mention Bris, Torah or Malchus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Why did you omit them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> I acted according to Rav:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one did not mention Bris, Torah or Malchus [Beis David] in Birkas ha'Mazon, he fulfilled his obligation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Seemingly, Rav's ruling was only b'Di'eved. Why did Rav Chisda follow it? Rashba's text - Rav would not mention them in Birkas ha'Mazon, because they do not apply to women, and only one text of Birkas ha'Mazon was enacted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We know that mentioning Bris is not absolutely necessary, for it does not apply to women (their Mitzvah of Birkas ha'Mazon is the same as men's);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Mentioning Torah and Malchus is not absolutely necessary, for they do not apply to women or slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Why did you act like Rav, against all the Tana'im and Amora'im above?!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ADDITIONS TO BIRKAS HA'MAZON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One must mention [Hash-m's] Malchus in ha'Tov veha'Metiv.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the Chidush that every Berachah needs Malchus? R. Yochanan already taught this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> He teaches that two Malchuyos are required; the second is to compensate for the lack of Hash-m's Malchus in Boneh Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, a third Malchus should be required, to compensate for not mentioning Malchus in Birkas ha'Aretz!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>You must say, we need not compensate for [omitting Malchus in] Birkas ha'Aretz, because it is adjacent to another Berachah (the Malchus of Birkas ha'Zan counts for it).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Likewise, we need not compensate for Boneh Yerushalayim, because it is adjacent to another Berachah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we need not compensate for Boneh Yerushalayim because it lacks the Malchus that every Berachah needs, because it is adjacent to another Berachah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, it is improper to mention Malchus Beis David without mentioning Malchus Hash-m; for this we compensate in ha'Tov veha'Metiv.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Two Malchuyos are required in ha'Tov veha'Metiv, in addition to the usual Malchus at the beginning (Baruch Atah... Melech ha'Olam). (We say ha'El Avinu Malkeinu... ha'Kel ha'Melech ha'Gadol.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> If (on Shabbos) one forgot to mention Shabbos (he did not say Retzeh in Boneh Yerushalayim), he says, "Baruch she'Nasan Shabbasos li'Menuchah... Baruch Mekadesh ha'Shabbos."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> Who said this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Gidal:</span> Rav said it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> If one forgot to mention Yom Tov (Ya'aleh v'Yavo), he says, "Baruch she'Nasan Yomim Tovim... l'Simchah... Baruch Mekadesh Yisrael veha'Zemanim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> Who said this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Gidal:</span> Rav said it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira citing Rav Gidal):</span> If one forgot to mention Rosh Chodesh, he says "Baruch she'Nasan Roshei Chodashim...."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> I do not know whether or not he says "l'Simchah," whether or not he ends the Berachah, and whether he said this himself or in the name of Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Nachman erred and returned to the beginning of Birkas ha'Mazon; Gidal bar Minyomi asked him why.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> It is because Rav Shila cited Rav to say that one who erred must return to the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Gidal:</span> But Rav Huna cited Rav to say that if one erred, he says "Baruch she'Nasan..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Rav Menasiya bar Tachlifa cited Rav to say this is only if he did not begin ha'Tov veha'Metiv -- but if he began it, he must return to the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin citing Shmuel):</span> If one forgot to mention Rosh Chodesh in Shemoneh Esreh, he goes back (he must repeat it); if one forgot Rosh Chodesh in Birkas ha'Mazon, he does not go back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Avin):</span> Why is Shemoneh Esreh different than Birkas ha'Mazon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Amram citing Rav Nachman):</span> Shmuel did not explain this to me, I assi,e as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shemoneh Esreh is an obligation, therefore one must repeat it; Birkas ha'Mazon is not an obligation, i.e. one need not eat bread, therefore he need not repeat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Avin):</span> According to this, on Shabbos and Yom Tov, when one must eat bread, he should have to repeat it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Amram):</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shila citing Rav):</span> If one forgot (to mention Shabbos or Yom Tov in Birkas ha'Mazon), he must repeat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Huna cited Rav to say that if one erred, he says "Baruch she'Nasan..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We already answered, this is only if he did not begin ha'Tov veha'Metiv -- but if he began it, he must return to the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE AMOUNT ONE MUST EAT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> How much must one eat to be included in a Zimun?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(The anonymous first Tana (assumed to be R. Meir) says, a k'Zayis; R. Yehudah says, a k'Beitzah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Meir holds that a k'Zayis is significant; R. Yehudah says, a k'Beitzah is significant.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Elsewhere, they express the opposite opinions!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (If one who was on his way to do a Mitzvah on Erev Pesach and remembered that he has Chametz in his house:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he can return to burn it and still be able to perform the Mitzvah afterwards, he must do so;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If not, he should annul the Chametz in his heart and proceed to the Mitzvah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, if someone left Yerushalayim and remembered that he is carrying Kodesh meat (which became Pasul upon leaving)-</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he already passed Tzofim (Rashi - a particular place; Tosfos - anywhere) [from where one can see the Mikdash], he burns it where he is;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If not, he returns to burn it in front of ha'Birah (in Har ha'Bayis), from wood designated for the Ma'arachah (the fire on the Mizbe'ach).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What quantity (of Chametz or meat) obligates one to return?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Meir):</span> The quantity for both of them is k'Beitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> The quantity for both of them is k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> The opinions must be switched (Tosfos - in our Mishnah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The opinions need not be switched -- here, they argue about how to expound "v'Achalta v'Savata u'Verachta":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says "v'Achalta" refers to eating, "v'Savata" alludes to drinking;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Eating" normally refers to a k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah expounds "v'Achalta v'Savata" -- eating that gives satiation, i.e. a k'Beitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Regarding returning (to burn Chametz or Kodesh meat), their argument is based on reasoning-</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Meir holds that one must return for a quantity that is important enough to be Metamei, i.e. a k'Beitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yehudah holds that one must return for a quantity that is important enough for one to be liable for eating it, i.e. a k'Zayis.</p>
