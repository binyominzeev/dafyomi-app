<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE PROPER TEXT TO SAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> A person should never exclude himself from the assemblage (by saying "Bless" instead of "Let us bless").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If there are three without him, [he does not say, "Let us bless" to include himself, rather,] he says "Bless"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, he <i>may</i> say, "Bless," but it is better to say, "Let us bless."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah - Mishnah):</span> If there are from six people until ten, they may split up (into groups of at least three, each group will be Mezamen by itself; if there are 10, this is forbidden, for they were obligated to be Mezamen with Hash-m's name).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand this if it is better to say, "Let us bless," for then the smaller groups can say the preferred text;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But if it is better to say, "Bless," then why may six split up? This will cause them to use the inferior text!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> It is better to say, "Let us bless."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Whether one said, "Bless" or "Let us bless," we do not criticize him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Meticulous people criticize him (for excluding himself from the assemblage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One can tell if someone is a Chacham from the way he blesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rebbi says, a Chacham says (in Birkas ha'Zan), "uv'Tuvo" ( implying that Hash-m gives generously), a Bor (crude person) says, "umi'Tuvo" (connoting meagerly giving the bare essentials).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> But the verse says, "umi'Birchascha Yevorach Beis Avdecha l'Olam"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> When making a request, It is proper to request a small amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We are encouraged to make big requests -- "Harchev Picha va'Amal'ehu"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to Divrei Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> A Chacham says, "b'Tuvo Chayinu," a Bor says "[b'Tuvo] Chayim" (excluding himself, as if he does not live through Hash-m's bounty).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Chachamim of Neharbal switch the opinions ("Chayim" is better, it includes all the living).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>The Halachah does not follow Chachamim of Neharbal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A Chacham says, "Nevarech she'Achalnu mi'Shelo" (implying that all eat from His food), a Bor says, "l'Mi she'Achalnu mi'Shelo" (implying that there are different suppliers of food, i.e. he blesses his host).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> But we say (in the Hagadah on Pesach), "l'Mi she'Asah la'Avoseinu v'Lanu Es Kol ha'Nisim ha'Elu"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> There, it is clear that we refer to Hash-m, only He can do miracles.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A Chacham says, "Baruch she'Achalnu mi'Shelo," a Bor says, "Al ha'Mazon she'Achalnu" (Rashi - he does not say that he blesses Hash-m; Tosfos - this connotes, one whom we should bless only on account of his food, i.e. the host).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> This applies only to a Zimun of three (i.e. less than ten), but if there are ten, since we say "Elokeinu," it is clear that we bless Hash-m (and saying "Al ha'Mazon" is acceptable);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The others answer like the Mezamen said, "Baruch Hash-m Elokeinu... Al ha'Mazon she'Achalnu."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>BERACHOS</i> ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The same applies if there are 10 or [up to] 10,000.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The next clauses contradict this -- if there are 100, if there are 1000, if there are 10,000...!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> R. Akiva equates 10 with 10,000, R. Yosi ha'Glili distinguishes them:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> The Berachah is according to the number of people - "b'Makhelos Barchu Elokim..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> We find in synagogue...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Akiva learn from R. Yosi ha'Glili's verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Meir) Question:</span> What is the source that even fetuses sang Shirah at Keri'as Yam Suf? (Rashba - it was fitting for them to sing, for frightening things often cause miscarriages, but not one woman miscarried.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "B'Makhelos Barchu Elokim Hash-m mi'Mekor Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yosi ha'Glili have a source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes - he learns this from "mi'Mekor" (in the Mishnah, he learns from "b'Makhelos").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Ravina and Rav Chama bar Buzi visited the Reish Galusa; Rav Chama was trying to get 100 people to bless together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> This is unnecessary -- Rava taught that the Halachah follows R. Akiva!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> When we eat with the Reish Galusa, most of us bless in groups of three (before the Reish Galusa, and wait for him to finish and be Mezamen with the people near him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is better to bless in groups of ten [to be Mezamen with Hash-m's name]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, [they would have to bless loudly, and] the Reish Galusa would hear and he would be upset (that they blessed before him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They should wait to be Yotzei through the Reish Galusa (he will be Mezamen with Hash-m's name)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since there are many people, most people [are too far away and] cannot hear him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah Tosfa'ah):</span> If three ate together and one of them hastily blessed by himself (without a Zimun), the others can fulfill the Mitzvah of Zimun through him (if he answers); he, though, does not fulfill the Mitzvah, for it is not retroactive (after Birkas ha'Mazon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> (We say "Barchu Es Hash-m ha'Mevorach.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>Rafram bar Papa visited a certain synagogue; he read in the Torah, and said only, "Barchu Es Hash-m," he did not say, "ha'Mevorach." Everyone present yelled, "Barchu Es Hash-m ha'Mevorach!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Rava (to Rafram bar Papa):</span> Why get involved in arguments? (Rashi - you should follow R. Yishmael, for even R. Akiva agrees that it is better to say ha'Mevorach, just he does not obligate doing so!) Also, everyone follows R. Yishmael!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHO MAY SAY <i>BIRKAS HA'MAZON</i> TOGETHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If three ate together, they may not separate (and bless individually); the same applies to four or five;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If six ate together, they may separate (into two groups of three, each will be Mezamen by itself); the same applies to seven, eight or nine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Ten may not separate (for they were obligated to be Mezamen with Hash-m's name); if there are [at least] 20, they may divide (into two groups of ten; each will be Mezamen with Hash-m's name).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If two groups ate in one house:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they can see each other, they join for a Zimun; if not, each must be Mezamen by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Eliezer says, we do not bless on wine until adding water (only then it is fit to drink);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Chachamim permit this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We already learned this (the first law of our Mishnah) in another Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If three people ate together, they must be Mezamen together!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> Our Mishnah teaches R. Aba's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> If three sat to eat together, even if they did not eat yet, they may not separate (rather, they must eat and be Mezamen together).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #1 (R. Aba):</span> If three sat and ate together, even if each ate from his own loaf, they may not divide.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It teaches Rav Huna's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If three came from three groups, they may not divide (even if they did not eat together).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This is only if each came from a group of three (and was obligated to be part of a Zimun).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is only if they were not party to a Zimun with the groups they left; if they were, they already fulfilled their obligation to be part of a Zimun.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">50b----------------------------------------50b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava, for himself - Mishnah):</span> If half of a [Tamei] bed was stolen or lost, or divided among brothers or partners, it is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the other half was returned, it is Mekabel Tum'ah from now on.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Once it was divided, its old Tum'ah is lost;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Similarly, if those who separated from the groups were already party to a Zimun, they lost their obligation, it does not return when they come together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two groups...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one waiter serves both of them, he makes them join.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OTHER USES OF FOODS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> We do not bless on wine... until adding water (only then it is fit to drink);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> We do not bless Borei Pri ha'Gafen on raw wine (i.e. before adding water), rather, Borei Pri ha'Etz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Raw wine may be used to wash the hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>After adding water, we bless Borei Pri ha'Gafen on it, and it may not be used to wash the hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, in either case we bless Borei Pri ha'Gafen, and it may not be used to wash the hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is the following teaching of Shmuel?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may use bread for any need (Tosfos - if it is not disgraceful).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Chachamim agree with R. Eliezer that we do not bless on the Kos Shel Berachah (on which we say Birkas ha'Mazon) until adding water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Oshaya):</span> This is the nicest way to do the Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim say that we bless Borei Pri ha'Gafen? It is not fit to drink!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Tiferes Yisrael - it is somewhat fitting to drink raw, and also,) it is fit for Koreiti (honey and spices mixed with a <i>majority</i> of wine (regular mixed wine is mostly water)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are four Halachos regarding bread (to refrain from ruining it):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not put raw meat over bread;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We do not pass a full cup over it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We do not throw bread;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We do not support a bowl with bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Ameimar, Rav Ashi and Mar Zutra were eating together; dates and pomegranates were served. Mar Zutra threw some (cooked meat - Maharsha does not know where this belongs in the text, for it seems that he threw dates and pomegranates) in front of Rav Ashi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> A Beraisa forbids throwing food -- don't you hold like it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Mar Zutra:</span> It only forbids throwing bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi - Beraisa #1):</span> Just like it is forbidden to throw bread, it is forbidden to throw [other] foods.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question - contradiction (Mar Zutra - Beraisa #2):</span> Even though it is forbidden to throw bread, it is permitted to throw [other] foods.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> It is forbidden to throw foods that will get spoiled, it is permitted to throw foods that will not get spoiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> [For a good omen,] we stream wine out of pipes (it is caught in a vessel below) in front of a Chasan and Kalah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We throw parched grain and nuts in front of them in summer, but not in winter (when the ground is muddy).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We may not throw rolls in summer or winter (they get ruined even in summer).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>ONE WHO PUT FOOD IN HIS MOUTH WITHOUT BLESSING FIRST</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one put food in his mouth without blessing first, he should move it to one side and bless.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> He should swallow it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> He should spit it out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #3):</span> He should move it to one side and bless.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> If the food he put in his mouth was a liquid, he should swallow it; if it is a [solid] food that will not be repulsive if he spits it out, he should do so; if it is a food that will be repulsive if he spits it out, he should move it to one side and bless.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even for a food that will not be repulsive, he should move it to one side and bless!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak Kaskesa'ah):</span> It says, "Yemalei Fi Tehilasecha" (one's mouth should be full of Hash-m's praise; one should not bless with something inside it).</p>
