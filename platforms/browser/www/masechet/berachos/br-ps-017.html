<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>REQUESTS AFTER PRAYER (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Safra would request that Hash-m put peace among the angels appointed over the nations (for then there will be peace among the nations), among Chachamim, and among Talmidim engaged in Torah, whether or not they are Lishmah; may those learning Lo Lishmah learn Lishmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(Maharsha - our plight in exile is like being constricted in the corner of a house;)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> R. Alexandri would request that Hash-m establish us in an illuminated corner (save us from afflictions), not a dark corner; our hearts should not mourn, our vision should not wane.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> He would say, "We want to do Your will, but the sourdough in the dough (i.e. the Yetzer ha'Ra in our hearts) and oppression of the kingdoms is stopping is! May it be Your will to save us from them!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rava would say. "Before I was formed, I was not worthy (to be formed); now that I was formed, I am not important;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even while alive, I am dirt, all the more so after I will die!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>I am a vessel full of shame -- may it be Your will that I sin no more, and remove what I already sinned in Your mercy, but not through evil afflictions and sicknesses."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is the confession that Rav Hamnuna Zuti would say on Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Mar brei d'Ravina would request, "Hash-m, guard my lips from speaking evil and deception, let my soul be silent to those who curse me, and like dirt to all (it is trampled on but not destroyed), open my heart to Your Torah, make my soul pursue Your Mitzvos, save me from bad encounters, the Yetzer ha'Ra, an evil woman and all evil happenings;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Thwart the counsel of those who plan evil against me; may my words and thoughts be pleasing to You, my Rock and Redeemer."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>When Rav Sheshes fasted, after his Shemoneh Esreh he would say, "When the Mikdash stood, a sinner would bring a Chatas, only the blood and Chelev were offered, and this would atone for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I just fasted, my blood and Chelev were diminished; may it be Your will to consider this as if I offered a Korban, and be pleased with me."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ADAGES OF CHACHAMIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>When R. Yochanan would finish learning Iyov, he would say, "The end of man is to die, the end of an animal is to be slaughtered, everything is destined to die;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Happy is the one who was raised in Torah, and toils in Torah and is pleasing to his Maker, had a good reputation growing up and dies with a good reputation;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shlomo said about such a person, 'Tov Shem mi'Shemen Tov v'Yom ha'Maves mi'Yom Hivaldo.'"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir used to say, "Learn with all your heart and soul to know My ways, diligently guard the doors of My Torah (keep out heretical ideas), guard My Torah in your heart, let My fear be in front of your eyes, guard your mouth from all sin, purify and sanctify yourself from any guilt, and I will be with you everywhere."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Rabanan of Yavneh used to say, "I am a creation (who understands good and evil), like my colleague (an Am ha'Aretz, who does not learn Torah); my work is in the city (in the study hall), his is [harder,] in the field; each of us rises early to his work;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just as he does not desire to do my work, I do not desire to do his;"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Perhaps the Am ha'Aretz justifiably does not learn, for he would not be able to learn as much as I!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It does not matter whether one learns a lot or a little, as long as his intentions are for the sake of Shamayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Maharsha):</span> Rabanan of Yavneh used to say, "I am a creation, like my colleague (who learns less); my work is in the city, his is in the field (after he finishes his daily learning); each of us rises to his work;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like he is not outstanding in my work, I am not outstanding in his;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Perhaps he will not get reward like me, for he does not learn as much!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It does not matter whether one learns a lot or a little, as long as his intentions are for the sake of Shamayim! (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Abaye used to say, "A person should be cunning to find ways to fear his Creator;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Ma'aneh Rach Meshiv Chemah' (a gentle answer averts anger);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One should have great peace with his brothers, relatives and all people, even a Nochri in the market, in order that he will be beloved above and below, and people will accept him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>No one ever greeted R. Yochanan ben Zakai (he always greeted first), even a Nochri in the market."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rava used to say, "The purpose of Torah wisdom is repentance and good deeds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A person should not learn Tanach and Mishnah and rebel against his parents, his Rebbi, and Chachamim greater than he -- 'Reishis Chachmah Yir'as Hash-m Sechel Tov l'Chol Oseihem';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It does not say 'l'Osim', rather, 'l'Chol Oseihem', to those who do Mitzvos Lishmah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one learns Lo Lishmah, it would have been better if he had not been created." (Here, this refers to learning with intent to persecute others; other forms of Lo Lishmah, e.g. in order to receive honor, are permitted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav used to say, "The World to Come is unlike this world -- there, there is no eating or drinking, reproduction, business, jealousy, hatred or competition;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tzadikim sit with crowns on their heads and enjoy the Shechinah -- 'va'Yechezu Es ha'Elokim va'Yochlu va'Yishtu' (beholding the Shechinah satiates like eating and drinking.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Hash-m made a greater promise to women than to men -- 'Nashim Sha'ananos... Banos Botchos' (they are calm and assured)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav):</span> How do women merit [a large] portion in the World to Come? (They are exempt from learning Torah; every word of Torah is like all 613 Mitzvos (Gra)!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> They bring their children to synagogues to learn, and allow their husbands to learn Torah in other places, even though they must wait for them to return (therefore, they have a share in the learning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>When the Rabanan would leave the academy of R. Ami, they would say [to each other], "May you see all your needs in your life, and may your end be life in the World to Come; your hope is for generations [of Mashi'ach and Techiyas ha'Mesim];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>May you merit proper understanding, wisdom and knowledge, may you sing, radiate like the light of day, rejoice in virtue, and run to hear Hash-m's words."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>When the Rabanan would leave the academy of Rav Chisda, they would say, "Alufeinu Mesubalim";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel (or, R. Yochanan or R. Eliezer)):</span> This means, our leaders in Torah are laden with Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(The other one):</span> This means, our leaders in Torah and Mitzvos are laden with suffering.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>"Ein Peretz v'Ein Yotzeis v'Ein Tzevachah" -- our company should not be like that of David, Shaul or Elisha, from which came out, respectively, Achitofel, Do'eg and Gechazi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Bi'Rechovoseinu" -- we should not have a son or Talmid that will publicly go off the proper path.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel (or, R. Yochanan or R. Eliezer)):</span> "Shim'u Elai Abirei Lev ha'Rechokim mi'Tzedakah" -- the entire world is fed through Tzedakah, except for them -- they are fed through their own merit;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(The other one):</span> The entire world is fed in their merit, they are not fed even in their own merits (they struggle to obtain their needs).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Rav Yehudah said in the name of Rav:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Every day, a voice from Heaven announces that the entire world is fed in the merit of R. Chanina ben Dosa, yet R. Chanina subsists on one Kav of carobs for an entire week!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Both explanations of the verse argue with Rav Yehudah himself:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Abirei Lev" refers to a foolish nation (descendants of the Giv'onim) in Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> A proof of their foolishness is that not one of them ever converted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> The residents of Masa Mechasya are "Abirei Lev" -- even though they see the honor of Torah twice every year ( when the Chachamim gather to learn the laws of the festival; Tosfos - fire would descend from Shamayim), not one of them ever converted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CONCERN FOR HAUGHTINESS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Chasan wants to say Shema... (R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, not everyone is fitting to flaunt his piety).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel is concerned for haughtiness, Chachamim are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> In a locale where people work on the ninth of Av, we work; in a locale where people do not work, one may not work;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In every place, Chachamim do not work.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, everyone should conduct himself like a Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Both Chachamim and R. Shimon contradict themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> The opinions (in one of these Mishnayos) must be switched.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> The opinions need not be switched:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> Chachamim are not concerned for haughtiness regarding Keri'as Shema, for the Chasan acts like everyone else (who say it that night);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding Tish'ah b'Av, since all other Amei ha'Aretz are working, it is haughtiness [for an Am ha'Aretz] not to work.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel is concerned for haughtiness regarding Keri'as Shema -- since it requires intent, one who says it flaunts his ability to concentrate, and we know that a Chasan cannot concentrate!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(Today, the Halachah is that a Chasan should say Shema -- omitting Shema would show that he normally has proper intent!)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Regarding Tish'ah b'Av, not working does not show that one considers himself to be a Chacham -- rather, people will think that he is unemployed and has no work to do, like so many other people!</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK MI SHE'MESO</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE INVOLVED WITH A <i>MES</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven lost a close relative (over whom he must mourn) and the Mes is in front of him (unburied), he is exempt from Keri'as Shema, Tefilah, Tefilin and all [positive] Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The law of those carrying the coffin, Chilufeihem (those who will alternate with the carriers) and Chilufei Chilufeihem:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Those in front of the coffin (where it has not yet reached) -- if they are needed to carry it, they are exempt (from Shema);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Those in back of the coffin (who already carried it) -- even if they are needed, they are obligated (because they already participated in the burial).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> Those in front of or in back of the coffin -- if they are needed to carry it, they are exempt (from Shema); if not, they are obligated. (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Both of them are exempt from Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>After the burial:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they can complete Shema before reaching the Shurah (rows of people consoling the mourners), they should begin Shema; if not, they should not begin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Those on the inside of the Shurah are exempt, those on the outside are obligated.</p>
