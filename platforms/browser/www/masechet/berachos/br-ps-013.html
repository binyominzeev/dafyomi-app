<p class="dedicationbox">BERACHOS 13 (25 Av) - Dedicated by Rabbi Dr. Eli Turkel of Raanana, l'Iluy Nishmas his mother, Golda bas Chaim Yitzchak Ozer (Mrs. Gisela Turkel) who passed away on 25 Av 5760. Mrs. Turkel accepted Hashem's Gezeiros with love; may she be a Melitzas Yosher for her offspring and for all of Klal Yisrael. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>NAMES THAT CHANGED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> "Hineni Oseh Chadashah Atah Sitzmach" -- this refers to the war of Gog and Magog;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like a man who was walking on the road -- a wolf came, and he was saved from it; he went around recounting the incident. A lion came, and he was saved from it; he went around recounting the incident with the lion. A snake came, and he was saved from it; he forgot the previous incidents, and went around recounting the last incident.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, Yisrael's new afflictions cause them to forget their previous ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>"Avram Hu Avraham" -- at first, he was the Av (patriarch) of Aram (where he was born); later, he became Av of the whole world ("<b>AV</b> HaMon Goyim");</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"Sarai" (singular) -- at first, she was empress of her nation; later, she is called "Sarah," empress of the whole world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Bar Kapara - Beraisa):</span> One who calls Avraham "Avram" transgresses an Aseh -- "v'Hayah Shimcha Avraham";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Eliezer says, he transgresses a Lav -- "v'Lo Yikarei Od Es Shimcha Avram."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, one who calls Sarah "Sarai" also transgresses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m only commanded Avraham (but not us) to call her "Sarah" and not "Sarai" ("Sarai Ishtecha Lo Sikra Es Shemah...").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should be forbidden to call Yakov "Yakov"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This cannot be, for the Torah itself [sometimes] calls him Yakov afterwards -- "va'Yomer Elokim... Yakov Yakov."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi bar Avin):</span> We find "Avram" later in Tanach -- "Ata Hu Hash-m Elokim Asher Bacharta b'Avram"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the Navi praises Hash-m for choosing [Avraham while he was still called} Avram and changing his name.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HAYAH KOREI</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SHEMA REQUIRES INTENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was reading [Parshas Shema] in the Torah, and it was time to recite Keri'as Shema -- if he had intent, he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, between the Perakim (breaks between chapters or blessings of Shema) one may greet someone to whom one must show honor (if he comes) and one may respond (return a greeting);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the middle (of the Parshiyos or Berachos) one greets someone whom one fears and responds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, in the middle one greets on account of fear and responds on account of honor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Between the Perakim, one greets on account of honor and responds to anyone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The following are the points called "between the Perakim":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Between the first two Berachos, between the second Berachah and Shema, between Shema and v'Hayah Im Shamo'a, between v'Hayah Im Shamo'a and va'Yomer, between va'Yomer and Emes v'Yatziv;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, one may not interrupt between va'Yomer and Emes v'Yatziv.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah says, we say Shema before v'Hayah Im Shamo'a in order to accept Ol (the yoke of) Malchus Shamayim before Ol Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We say v'Hayah Im Shamo'a before va'Yomer, because the former [discusses learning Torah, which] applies during the day and night, whereas va'Yomer [discusses Tzitzis, which] applies only during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> Our Mishnah teaches that Mitzvos require intention!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says that he was Yotzei only if he had intent, i.e. to fulfill the Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it means, if he had intent to read.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that he was reading!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was proofreading. (Tosfos - he was Yotzei only if he intended to read the words properly. Ra'ah explains, there are three levels of intention: intent to fulfill the Mitzvah, intent to do the Ma'aseh Mitzvah (to recite the words, as opposed to proofreading), and to think about the meaning of the words. The last intent applies only to the first verse of Shema; the Gemara did not discuss this.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MUST SHEMA BE RECITED IN HEBREW?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Keri'as Shema must be recited like it is written (in Hebrew);</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "v'Hayu [ha'Devarim ha'Eleh]" -- "they shall be" like they are [in the Torah, in Hebrew].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Shema" -- "hear" in any language you understand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rebbi expound "Shema"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that one must say the words audibly to his own ears.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold like the opinion that one is Yotzei even if it was not audible to his ears.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound "v'Hayu"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that one may not recite Shema out of order.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's source that one may not recite out of order?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said "Devarim" -- the extra "Hei" in "ha'Devarim" teaches this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim do not expound the "Hei."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Rebbi holds that Torah (Tosfos - Parshiyos that one must recite, such as Parshas Zachor or Keri'as Bikurim) may be recited in any language;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he held that Torah must be recited in Hebrew, he would not need "v'Hayu" to teach that Shema must be recited in Hebrew!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He could hold that it must be recited in Hebrew; "v'Hayu" is needed, so we will not learn from the word "Shema" to permit any language.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they held that Torah may be recited in any language, they would not need "Shema" to permit Keri'as Shema in any language!</p>

<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Akiva.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, R. Zutra requires Keri'ah of the second Parshah because it says "l'Daber Bam" -- he should also require Keri'ah of the first Parshah, for it says "v'Dibarta Bam"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, R. Zutra means, intent and Keri'ah are required in the first Parshah; after this, the Mitzvah is just Keri'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, he requires intent and Keri'ah in the first Parshah because it says "Al Levavecha" and "v'Dibarta Bam" -- he should also require both in the second Parshah, for it says "Al Levavchem l'Daber Bam"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds "Al Levavechem" like R. Yitzchak;</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>RECITATION OF THE FIRST VERSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Sumchus):</span> One who prolongs the word "Echad," his days and years are lengthened.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> This refers to prolonging the "Dalet" of "Echad."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> One must be careful not to rush the (Rashi - Kamatz under the) "Ches" in order to prolong the "Dalet." (Rashi's names for the Nekudos (vowels) are different than ours.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yirmeyah was prolonging "Echad" excessively. R. Chiya bar Aba told him that it suffices to extend it long enough to accept that Hash-m is King above, below, and in the four directions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Nasan bar Mar Ukva):</span> "Al Levavecha" must be said standing (in one place, i.e. stationary).</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows Rav Acha (the entire first Parshah requires intent).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Shema Yisrael Hash-m Elokeinu Hash-m Echad" is Rebbi's Keri'as Shema (what is required mid'Oraisa, the rest is mid'Rabanan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav):</span> When Rebbi teaches us, I do not see him interrupt to accept on himself Ol Malchus Shamayim at the time of Keri'as Shema!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Bar Kapara):</span> According to me, we understand why Rebbi always teaches something pertaining to Yetzi'as Mitzrayim at the time;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if he reads the rest of Shema later (the third Parshah mentions Yetzi'as Mitzrayim), why must he teach about it now?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon):</span> This is in order to mention Yetzi'as Mitzrayim at the time of Shema.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman (to his slave):</span> If you see me falling asleep during the first verse, arouse me so that I say it properly; after this, do not disturb me.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was stout (it was hard for him to turn totally onto his side, therefore he was permitted to lean slightly).</p>
