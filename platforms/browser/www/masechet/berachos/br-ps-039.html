<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BLESSINGS THAT DEPEND ON INTENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> How could R. Yochanan bless after eating a salted olive? Since the pit was removed, it is less than a k'Zayis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> One need not eat the volume of a big olive to make a Berachah Acharonah, it suffices to eat the volume of an average olive;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan ate a big olive, without the pit it was the volume of an average olive.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Whenever Mishnayos refer to k'Zayis, it is not a big or small olive, rather, an average olive, i.e. Aguri.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> It is not called Aguri -- rather, Avruti (or, some say, Samrusi);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is called Aguri because the oil is stored inside (it is not absorbed in the fruit).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about the blessing for Shelakos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Two Talmidim were in front of Bar Kapara; cabbage, another kind of Shelakos, and meat of a partridge were brought in front of him. He gave permission to the first student to bless; he blessed on the meat; the second sneered at him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Bar Kapara was angry at Shimon -- "Granted, the first student acted like one who never tasted meat (it was Chaviv, preferable, to him, therefore he blessed on it), but why did you sneer?!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Later, he changed his mind -- "I am angry at the first student. If no Chacham is here, at least there is an elder here (you should have asked me)!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Neither student lived out the year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The first student held that the blessing for Shelakos is [the same as the blessing for meat,] sheha'Kol, therefore he blessed on the more preferable food; the second student held that the blessing for Shelakos is Borei Pri ha'Adamah, therefore it has precedence over meat, which is sheha'Kol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree that the blessing for Shelakos is sheha'Kol;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first student held that one blesses on the Chaviv; Shimon held that one should bless on cabbage, for it nourishes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira citing Rav Huna):</span> If turnip heads are minced coarsely, the blessing is Borei Pri ha'Adamah; if they are minced finely (this is inferior), the blessing is sheha'Kol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The blessing on both of them is Borei Pri ha'Adamah -- they are minced finely to sweeten them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi citing Rav Kahana):</span> Little flour is added to a cooked beet dish, the blessing is Borei Pri ha'Adamah; much flour is added to a cooked turnip dish, the blessing is Borei Minei Mezonos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rav Kahana):</span> The blessing on both of them is Borei Pri ha'Adamah -- much flour is added merely to make it stick together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A cooked beet dish is good for the heart and eyes, and all the more so for the intestines;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is only if it is cooked on a stovetop, and it is boiling audibly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Clearly, water in which beets, turnips or any Shelakos were cooked has the same blessing as the beets, turnips or Shelakos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> What is the blessing on water in which Shivsa (dill, used to give flavor to soup, it is not intended to be eaten) was cooked?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is added for taste, the blessing would be Borei Pri ha'Adamah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps it is to absorb the froth, and the blessing is sheha'Kol?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> Once Sheves gives taste to a cooked dish, Terumah and Tum'as Ochlim no longer apply to it (for no taste remains in it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that it is to add taste.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN TO BLESS ON BREAD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> If dry bread was soaked in a bowl, its blessing is ha'Motzi. (Tosfos - if one prefers it, he may bless on it and exempt a whole loaf.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He argues with R. Chiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> One must finish blessing ha'Motzi at the same time he cuts from the loaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The soaked bread is already in pieces (so one should bless on the loaf)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Just as the soaked bread is already in pieces, also the bread is sliced when the blessing is finished!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, one must finish ha'Motzi before slicing from the loaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>People in Neharde'a followed R. Chiya, Rabanan followed Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> My mother told me that my father followed R. Chiya, but Rabanan follow Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Halachah follows Rava.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ON WHICH BREAD ONE SHOULD BLESS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If one has [large] pieces of bread and [smaller] whole loaves, one may bless on a piece to exempt the loaves;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The ideal Mitzvah is to bless on a whole loaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>All agree that it the pieces are of wheat and the loaves are of barley, it is better to bless on a piece to exempt the loaves (Tosfos - because wheat is before barley in the verse listing the seven species).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> Tana'im argue like Rav Huna and R. Yochanan:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One must make a whole, small onion Terumah, rather than a large, half-onion (because it lasts longer, even though the half-onion is larger (Rashi));</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, he must make the large half-onion Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yehudah holds that the primary concern is importance, a large half-onion is more important; Chachamim's primary concern is a complete entity.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No -- all agree that if a Kohen is around [to accept the Terumah], the primary concern is importance;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue when no Kohen is around.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In a place where there is a Kohen, we take the nicest produce to be Terumah (even if it does not last so long); where there is no Kohen, we take the produce that lasts the longest;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah says, [in either case] we take the nicest produce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> A G-d-fearing person should fulfill both opinions (with regard to which bread to bless on);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mar brei d'Ravina would put the piece in (Rashi - under) the loaf and cut (the loaf, or both of them. R. Tam - one can fulfill both opinions by cutting the loaf, even without putting the piece near it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> He puts the piece in the loaf, cuts and blesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Your teaching enables the Amora'im to conduct themselves the same way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> On Pesach (Seder night), all agree that one puts the piece in the loaf, to fulfill "Lechem Ani" (poor man's bread).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> On Shabbos one must recite the blessing on two loaves, to fulfill "Lechem Mishnah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> I saw Rav Kahana hold two loaves and cut one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Zeira would cut a large piece to suffice for the entire meal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> But that looks like gluttony!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Since he does so only on Shabbos, it does not look like guttony.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>When R. Ami and R. Asi would eat bread used for an Eruv [Chatzeros], they would bless on it; since it was used for one Mitzvah, it is good to use it for another.</p>
