<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PRECEDENCE AMONG DIFFERENT SPECIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If there are various foods...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> They argue when the foods have the same blessing -- R. Yehudah holds that the seven species have precedence, Chachamim hold that Chaviv (what he prefers) has precedence;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they have different blessings, he must make both blessings, all agree that he blesses first on whichever he wants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one wants to eat a radish and an olive, he blesses [just once] on the radish, and exempts the olive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the radish is primary (he eats the olive just to weaken the sharpness of the radish).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa - R. Yehudah):</span> He blesses on the olive, for it is one of the seven species.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does R. Yehudah argue with the following Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The general rule is, if one eats a primary and a secondary food together, he blesses only on the primary, this exempts the secondary.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps indeed he argues with it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If he eats the olive on account of the radish, he blesses on the radish and exempts the olive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, the radish is primary; R. Yehudah and Chachamim argue about something else;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The Mishnah is abbreviated, it means as follows:</span> if one wants to eat a radish and an olive, he blesses on the radish and exempts the olive;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is when the radish is primary; if not, all agree that he blesses on both.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>In general, when there are two species of the same blessing, he blesses on whichever he wants [and exempts the other];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehudah says, he blesses on the olive, for it is one of the seven species.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami or R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> They argue when the blessings are the same; R. Yehudah holds that the seven species have precedence, Chachamim hold that Chaviv has precedence;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they have different blessings, all agree that he must make both blessings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Ami and R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> They argue even when the blessings are different.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand the first opinion, but according to the second opinion, when the blessings are different, what do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> They argue about which he blesses on first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> A species that is earlier in the verse, "Eretz Chitah u'Se'orah v'Gefen u'Se'enah v'Rimon Eretz Zeis Shemen u'Devash" has precedence regarding Berachos (to bless on it first).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>He argues with R. Chanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanan):</span> The entire verse alludes to Shi'urim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Wheat -- (Mishnah):</span> If one enters Bayis ha'Menuga with clothes resting on his shoulder, and sandals and rings on his hands (not on the proper fingers), he and his clothes are Teme'im immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he enters wearing his clothes, sandals and rings (on the proper fingers), he is Tamei immediately, his clothes are Teme'im only after he tarries the time needed to eat a half a loaf of bread;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We gauge the time to eat wheat bread (not barley), reclining, with an accompaniment on the bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Barley -- a bone of a Mes at least the size of a barley kernel has Tum'as Maga (touching) and Tum'as Masa (moving), but not Tum'as Ohel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Grapes -- a Nazir is liable for [eating produce of vines] the quantity of a Revi'is of wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>(This is more than a Revi'is of water, for wine is thick -- when one fills a vessel above the brim with wine it does not spill out as soon as when it is filled with water. The difference depends on the dimensions of the vessel -- we must gauge the Revi'is according to a standard Revi'is vessel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Figs -- one who transfers food (from Reshus ha'Yachid to Reshus ha'Rabim or vice-versa) the volume of a dried fig on Shabbos is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Pomegranates -- (Mishnah):</span> If a [wooden] vessel of a Ba'al ha'Bayis (i.e. not a craftsman) has a hole the size of a pomegranate, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Olives -- (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> All the Shi'urim of Eretz Yisrael are a k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be -- each of the other fruits is also a Shi'ur!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Most of the Shi'urim of Eretz Yisrael are a k'Zayis (e.g. liability for eating forbidden fat, blood, Pigul, etc.).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>Dates -- one who eats the volume of a large date on Yom Kipur is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav Yosef argues with Rav Chanan, for the Shi'urim are not written in the Torah -- they are mid'Rabanan (elsewhere, the Gemara says "a tradition from Moshe from Sinai"), the verse is merely an Asmachta.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rav Chisda and Rav Hamnuna were eating together; there were dates and pomegranates, Rav Hamnuna blessed on a date.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Don't you hold like Rav Yosef, who says that a species mentioned earlier in the verse has precedence regarding Berachos?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rav Hamnuna:</span> Dates are the second species after [the second mention in the verse of] "Eretz," it has preference over pomegranates, which are the fifth after [the first] "Eretz."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> If only we had iron legs to [follow you around constantly] and hear your wisdom!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BLESSING ON FOODS THAT ARE SERVED DURING A MEAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna and Rav Nachman):</span> If figs and grapes were served in a meal, one must bless on them beforehand, but not afterwards (they are included in Birkas ha'Mazon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> He must bless on them beforehand and afterwards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The only thing that requires a blessing beforehand but not afterwards is Pas ha'Ba b'Kisnin. (All agree that such bread is not usually the basis of a meal. The Shulchan Aruch cites opinions that it is bread with "pockets" (containing honey or nuts), or made from a flavored dough (kneaded with oil, honey, or milk), or brittle wafers.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He argues with R. Chiya:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> Bread exempts all kinds of food, wine exempts all kinds of drinks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The Halachah is:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Things eaten on account of the meal (accompaniments for bread) during the meal do not require a blessing beforehand or afterwards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Things eaten not on account of the meal during the meal (i.e. for satiation but not as accompaniments) require a blessing beforehand, but not afterwards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Things normally eaten after the meal (e.g. fruits, even if eaten during the meal) require a blessing beforehand and afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> Things eaten on account of the meal (i.e. things normally eaten in a meal with bread), if eaten during the meal do not require a blessing beforehand or afterwards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Things not normally eaten on account of the meal, require a blessing beforehand during the meal, but not afterwards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Things eaten after the meal (i.e. it was customary to remove the bread, and serve other food afterwards) require a blessing beforehand and afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do things eaten on account of the meal during the meal not require a blessing beforehand or afterwards?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ben Zoma):</span> This is because [the blessing on] bread exempts them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, bread should also exempt wine!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ben Zoma):</span> Wine is different, we often bless on it even without desire to drink it (e.g. Kidush).</p>
