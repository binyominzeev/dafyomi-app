<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE DECREE TO FINISH BY MIDNIGHT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi did not explicitly say that the Halachah follows R. Shimon, Rav Acha inferred this from the following episode:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Two Rabanan drank a lot at the wedding of R. Yehoshua ben Levi's son (and slept past dawn, without saying Shema). R. Yehoshua ben Levi ruled that they should say Shema (before sunrise) -- in pressed circumstances, we may rely on R. Shimon's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A case occurred, R. Gamliel's sons...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Had they not heard this Halachah from their father before this?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They had heard it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They asked, do Chachamim argue with you? If so, they are the majority, the Halachah follows them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do they agree with you, and midnight is merely a mid'Rabanan deadline to distance people from transgressing?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Gamliel answered, they agree with me.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Raban Gamliel):</span> Not only this...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that R. Gamliel said that the Mitzvah of Kri'as Shema is only until midnight. R. Gamliel did not say this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He told his sons that even Chachamim, who say that the Mitzvah is only until midnight, agree that mid'Oraisa the Mitzvah is until dawn. They say until midnight to distance people from transgressing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chelev and limbs may be burned on the Mizbe'ach until dawn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Mishnah does not mention that (mid'Oraisa) the Korban Pesach may be eaten until dawn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> The following Mitzvos extend until dawn -- the evening Shema, Hallel on Pesach night, and eating the Korban Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Rav Yosef):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Elazar ben Azaryah, the Beraisa is like R. Akiva:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> It says, "v'Achlu Es ha'Basar ba'Lailah ha'Zeh," and "v'Avarti v'Eretz Mitzrayim ba'Lailah ha'Zeh" -- just like the latter was at midnight, the [deadline of] the former is at midnight;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, the Korban Pesach is eaten "b'Chipazon" (in haste) -- until the time of haste (dawn, when Mitzrayim compelled us to leave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why must it say "ba'Lailah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that it may be eaten during the day like other Kodshim -- "ba'Lailah" teaches, it may be eaten only at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Elazar, "ha'Zeh" (in "v'Achlu...") is needed for the Gezeirah Shavah -- but according to R. Akiva, what do we learn from it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is needed to forbid eating the Korban Pesach on another night;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought, since the Korban Pesach is Kodshim Kalim like Shelamim, just as Shelamim may be eaten for two days and a night, Pesach (its Zeman Achilah begins at night) may be eaten for two nights and a day!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar says, we already know this from "v'Lo Sosiru Mimenu Ad Boker."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva says, we could have understood that to refer to the second morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Elazar says, whenever it says "Boker," it refers to the next morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Other Tana'im argue as R. Elazar and R. Akiva do:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> "Sham Tizbach Es ha'Pesach ba'Arev k'Vo ha'Shemesh Mo'ed Tzeischa mi'Mitzrayim" -- you slaughter in the Erev (afternoon), you eat k'Vo ha'Shemesh (at night), you burn (leftovers) at Mo'ed Tzeischa mi'Mitzrayim (in the morning);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, you slaughter in the Erev, you eat from k'Vo ha'Shemesh until Mo'ed Tzeischa mi'Mitzrayim (morning).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(Presumably, R. Eliezer holds that it may be eaten only until midnight -- if not, R. Yehoshua does not argue with him!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> All agree that Bnei Yisrael were redeemed from Mitzrayim at night -- "Hotzi'acha Hash-m Elokecha mi'Mitzrayim Lailah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree that they left Mitzrayim during the day -- "mi'Macharas ha'Pesach Yatz'u Venei Yisrael";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about what was the time of haste:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Elazar says that it was midnight, when Mitzrayim were hasty (to send Yisrael away);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Akiva says that it was morning, when Yisrael consented to go.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa) Question:</span> It says, "Hotzi'acha Hash-m Elokecha mi'Mitzrayim Lailah" -- but Yisrael left during the day, "mi'Macharas ha'Pesach Yatz'u Venei Yisrael"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The redemption began at night.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LEAVING MITZRAYIM WITH WEALTH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(D'vei R. Yanai):</span> "Daber Na b'Oznei ha'Am" -- "Na" is a request;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m asked Moshe to ask Yisrael to request gold and silver vessels from Mitzrayim, in order that Avraham would not have a complaint that the prophecy (at Bris Bein ha'Besarim) of affliction was fulfilled, but the prophecy of leaving with great wealth was not fulfilled.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yisrael (to Moshe):</span> It is enough if we ourselves will leave!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">A parable:</span> people told a prisoner, "Tomorrow you will be freed, and you will receive great wealth"; he requested, "Take me out today, I do not ask for anything else!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>"Va'Yash'ilum" -- this teaches that Yisrael took Mitzrayim's property against their will.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> It was against the will of the Mitzriyim -- "u'Nevas Bayis Techalek Shalal";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> It was against the will of Yisrael, because it was a burden to carry it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> "Va'Yenatzlu Es Mitzrayim" -- Yisrael emptied out Mitzrayim like a Metzudah (trap) without grain (to attract birds);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> They emptied Mitzrayim like the Metzulah (depths) is empty of fish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>"Eheyeh Asher Eheyeh" -- Hash-m told Moshe to tell Yisrael that He is with us in our slavery in Mitzrayim, He will be with us in servitudes of other kingdoms.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> They are suffering, why must You tell them about future afflictions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> Tell them "Eheyeh Shelachani Aleichem" (do not allude to future servitudes; Maharsha - this was Hash-m's intent from the beginning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu) Question:</span> "Aneni Hash-m Aneni" -- why did Eliyahu ask twice that Hash-m answer him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asked Hash-m to bring fire from Shamayim to consume everything on the Mizbe'ach, and to distract people, so they will not say that it was done through witchcraft -- "V'Atah Hasibosa Es Libam Achoranis."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE TIME FOR THE MORNING SHEMA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What is the time to say the morning Shema?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mitzvah begins when it is light enough to distinguish between Techeles and white;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Eliezer):</span> It begins when one can distinguish between Techeles and [the color of green] leeks, and lasts until sunrise;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yehoshua):</span> It extends until the third hour of the day, for this is when kings rise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One who says Shema after this does not lose (he is not punished for saying it now, but he does not fulfill the Mitzvah), this is like learning [any other part of] Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does it mean "between Techeles and white"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It means, between shearings dyed Techeles to white shearings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even at night, one can distinguish them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, between the Techeles in shearings (the parts that absorbed the dye) to the white parts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir) (Answer #4 to Question (a)):</span> It begins when one can distinguish between a wolf and a dog;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (R. Akiva):</span> It begins when one can distinguish between a donkey and a wild donkey.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Acherim):</span> It begins when one can recognize a friend four Amos away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah follows Acherim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Halachah follows Acherim regarding the time for Tefilin, it follows Vatikin (humble people who treasure the Mitzvos) regarding Shema:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Vatikin finish the morning Shema at sunrise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Vatikin finish Shema at sunrise, in order to be Somech Ge'ulah to Tefilah (to begin Shemoneh Esreh right after Ga'al Yisrael, the blessing after Shema, which discusses redemption from Mitzrayim), and to pray during the day (according to all opinions).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> They learn from "Yira'ucha Im Shamesh."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SEMICHAS GE'ULAH L'TEFILAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi Ben Elyakim):</span> Anyone who is Somech Ge'ulah to Tefilah (Tosfos - and prays after sunrise) will not be harmed that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> I am Somech Ge'ulah to Tefilah, yet I get harmed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi):</span> You consider yourself harmed because you must bring myrtle to the king? You should pay to behold his countenance!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A person should strive to see Jewish kings, and even Nochri kings, so that if he merits he will perceive the difference between Malchei Yisrael (Mashi'ach) and Nochri kings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Beruna delighted to do Mitzvos; once, he was Somech Ge'ulah to Tefilah, and did not cease smiling the entire day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can one be Somech Ge'ulah to Tefilah? R. Yochanan taught that before Shemoneh Esreh one must say, "Hash-m Sefasai Tiftach...," and afterwards one must say "Yiheyu l'Ratzon..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> R. Yochanan requires saying "Hash-m Sefasai..." at Ma'ariv, but not at Shacharis, when one must be Somech Ge'ulah to Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan said that a Ben Olam ha'Ba is one who is Somech Ge'ulah to Tefilah at Ma'ariv!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> He requires saying "Hash-m Sefasai..." at Minchah, when there is no Ge'ulah to be Somech to Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> He requires saying it at every Tefilah; since Chachamim enacted it to be said with Tefilah, it is like part of Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support - Question:</span> How is it possible to be Somech Ge'ulah to Tefilah at Ma'ariv -- we must say "Hashkiveinu" (the second Berachah after Shema, which does not mention Ge'ulah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Chachamim appended it to the first Berachah (of Ge'ulah) after Shema, it is like part of Ge'ulah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, "Hash-m Sefasai..." is like part of Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Yiheyu l'Ratzon Imrei Fi..." could refer to what was said, or to what will be said -- why did Chachamim enact to say it after Tefilah, and not before?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah, son of R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> Since David said it after 18 Tehilim, we say it after 18 Berachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is the end of Tehilim 19!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (He holds that) "Ashrei ha'Ish..." and "Lamah Ragshu Goyim," which we count as separate Tehilim, are really one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah, son of R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> David said 103 Tehilim before saying Halelukah, until he discusses the downfall of the wicked -- "u'Resha'im Od Einam... Halelukah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is Tehilim 104!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Answer "Ashrei ha'Ish..." and "Lamah Ragshu Goyim" are really one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Every passage (of Tehilim) that was beloved to David, he began with and ended with "Ashrei" (Tosfos - he ended it similar to its beginning);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He began the first Tehilah with "Ashrei ha'Ish..." and ended it with "Ashrei Kol Chosei Vo."</p>
