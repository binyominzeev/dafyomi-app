<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> It refers to the two Amos. (An Amah is the distance from the elbow to the end of the long finger);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There were two rods for measuring an Amah in (a place in the Mikdash called) Shushan ha'Birah. One was half an Etzba bigger than the (six-Tefach) Amah of Moshe, and the other was one Etzba bigger.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why were there different Midos? (One Amah, that of Moshe, would suffice!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Workers (who contracted to build for Hekdesh) would be hired (to build) according to the Amah of Moshe. What they made was measured by a larger Midah, lest they be overpaid and transgress Me'ilah. (Tosfos (in Menachos) - they did not want to be overpaid, but in any case they would not transgress Me'ilah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It refers to our Mishnah. An Etzba of flesh between vertebrae is a Mum.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it has no Beitzim, or only one, this is a Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yishmael says if the sac has two compartments, there are two Beitzim. If there is only one compartment, there is only one Beitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Akiva says (if we do not see a Beitzah in a compartment) we sit the animal on its rump, and press on the compartment and the loins. If there is a Beitzah inside, it will come out (from where it is "hiding" in the compartment, and become discernible from the outside).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A case occurred, they pressed, yet no Beitzah was discerned. After Shechitah (outside the Mikdash), a Beitzah was found clinging to the wall. R.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If having only one Beitzah is a Mum, there is no need to say when it has none!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Akiva does not say "surely... ". Rather, we sit it on its rump, and press. If there is a Beitzah inside, it will come out.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> You waste money of Yisrael (through forbidding it)!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Mumim:</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Its feet are uncloven, like a donkey's feet;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It is Shachul, i.e. its thigh was dislocated;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>It is Kasul, i.e. one of its thighs (Rambam's text - knees) is too high.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> The Mishnah calls five or three legs a Mum. It refers to an extra or missing foreleg;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there is an extra or missing hind leg, it is Terefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(Regarding Terefos,) anything extra is as if it were missing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah does not require its feet to be uncloven <i>and</i> round like a donkey's. Rather, if they are round it is a Mum, even if they are cloven.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shachul and Kasul...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Shachul is a dislocated thigh. Kasul is if one thigh connects to the (hip at the) flank, and the other connects above the flank.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Sharu'a" is if one thigh is bigger than the other. "Kalut" is if its feet are uncloven like those of a donkey or horse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the bone of the foreleg or hind leg is broken, even if it is not noticeable, it is a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>Ila (an expert (29a)) testified about these Mumim (mentioned until now) in Yavneh. Chachamim agreed to them. He testified about three more, and Chachamim did not agree to them, for they had no tradition for them:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Its eye is round like human eye, its mouth is like a pig's, or if most of the Medaber (the unattached part) of the tongue was removed.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If a broken bone is not noticeable, it is not a Mum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It is not intrinsically noticeable, but it is evident when the animal works. (It limps.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FACIAL MUMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ila testified about these Mumim... (its eye is round like a human eye).</p></div>

If we do not know the gender, she has the stringencies of both;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Meir holds that Tum'as Yoledes applies (to a Tamei animal) because its eyes are round like human eyes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The black of an animal eye is (Ramban - not) normally round like a human eye, but the eye socket (Rashi; R. Chananel - the iris surrounding the black) is not (Ramban - is).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If its mouth is like a pig's.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah does not require its mouth to be Shapid (round; alternatively, the upper jaw narrows at the end into a snout) <i>and</i> Parus (the upper lip and jaw extend past the lower lip and jaw). Rather, if it is Parus it is a Mum, even if it is not Shapid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If most of the Medaber of the tongue was removed.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if most of the Medaber of the tongue was removed it is a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> And a case occurred in which the lower jaw extended past the upper jaw. R. Shimon ben Gamliel asked Chachamim, and they ruled that it is a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> This was not discussed earlier. Why does it say "and a case occurred... "?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (In the previous Mishnah,) Ila testified that if its mouth is like a pig's (the upper jaw extends past the lower jaw), it is a Mum, and Chachamim disagreed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Our Mishnah (implicitly) teaches that they argue only in this case, but if the lower jaw extends past the upper jaw, all agree that it is a Mum.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is a Mum only in a Kohen. "Ish Ish mi'Zera Aharon... " - a Kohen must resemble other (normal) Kohanim. It does not apply to animals!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> If the lower jaw extends past the upper jaw and there is a bone in the protrusion, it is a Mum even in an animal;</p></div>
