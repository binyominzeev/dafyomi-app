<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SHI'UR OF SELA'IM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one takes a rubbed out gold Dinar of Adriyanus (Hadrian) or Turainus (Trajan) Caesar (Rashi; Tosfos - a big and round gold Dinar) that sells for 25 Zuz, and deducts a sixth, the rest is the Shi'ur for Pidyon ha'Ben.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One is left with 20 Zuz and five sixths. Pidyon ha'Ben is only 20 Zuz!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if one deducts a sixth and another Zuz, the rest is the Shi'ur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One is left with 19 and five sixths. Pidyon ha'Ben is 20!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if one deducts a Zuz and then a sixth (of the remaining 24), the rest is the 20 (standard) Dinarim of Pidyon ha'Ben.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Twenty standard Dinarim are (almost) 28 and 7/12 Aravi Dinarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Sela of the Torah is three and a third (of today's) Dinarim (of Bavel):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Targum of "Esrim Gera" is "Esrim Ma'in";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Dinar is six Ma'ah of silver.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa) Question:</span> (One who redeems a Sedei Achuzah (that is a Beis Kor) at the start of Yovel pays 49 Sela'im and 49 Pundyonim.) A Sela is 48 Pundyonim. Why does one pay a Pundyon more than the 50 Sela'im stated in the Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The extra Pundyon is for Protrot (Rashi - so the money will outweigh the weight on the other pan of the balance scale; Rambam - the moneychanger's fee). (This is difficult for Rava, for a Dinar is six Ma'ah, 12 Pundyonim. It follows that a Sela is four Dinarim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After the measures were increased, a Torah Sela is 3 1/3 Dinarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Shekel is 20 Gera;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Chachamim can increase the Shekel?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yihyeh" (teaches that it may be more).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Chachamim may decrease the Shekel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Hu" (teaches that it must be at least 20 Gera).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav Ashi sent 17 Zuz to Rav Acha brei d'Ravina (a Kohen) for Pidyon ha'Ben, and asked him to return the extra third of a Zuz. (This is like Rava, who says that a Torah Sela is three and a third Zuzim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rav Acha:</span> You must send to me three more Zuz, for they increased the measures (and the Shi'ur of Pidyon ha'Ben also increased)! (Tosfos (Kesuvos 10a DH Nosen) - Rav Ashi agreed and sent the money, Ritva (Kidushin 11b) - Rav Ashi did not agree. He holds that it suffices to give five Torah Shekalim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Whenever the Torah mentions money Stam (without specifying), it is Sela'im. Stam money of Nevi'im is Litrin. (One Litra is 25 Sela'im.) Stam money of Kesuvim is Kinterin. (One Kintera is 100 Sela'im.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The only exception is the money that Avraham paid for Sedei Efron. It was Kinterin, for it says "... Shekel Kesef Over la'Socher";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>There are places where Shekalim are called Kinterin. (Avraham fered that Efron would later claim that he meant the Shekalim of such a place).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> Chachamim wanted to forbid all gold and silver in the world due to the gold and silver taken from Yerushalayim (at the time of the Churban, for most of it was Hekdesh), until they found a verse that permits - "u'Va'u Vah Paritzim v'Chileluha." (The Nochrim profaned the Hekdesh and made it Chulin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, the majority of gold and silver in the world is not from Yerushalayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Abaye):</span> Rather, they wanted to forbid all Hadri'ana and Toraina Dinarim (Rashi - Roman emperors who ruled over Yerushalayim; Tosfos - large, round coins) whose forms were blunted. (Perhaps the coins were from Yerushalayim (Tosfos - from the days of David and Shlomo), most of which are Hekdesh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They expounded that they are permitted - "v'Chileluha."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">50b----------------------------------------50b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE CURRENCY OF THE TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> All money mentioned in the Torah is Tzuri. (Rashi here - if Shekalim are not specified, it is Dinarim. Rashi in Kidushin - if Shekalim are not specified, it is Ma'in, the smallest coin in Tzur.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All money of Rabbinic decree is standard money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> The claim needed for Modeh b'Miktzas (the oath of partial admission) is an exception. It says "(if one will deposit) Kesef Oh Kelim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Modeh b'Miktzas applies only if the claim is at least two silver Ma'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Modeh b'Miktzas is different, for the Torah equates Kesef to Kelim. (Text of Rashi here - just like Kelim need not be worth a Dinar, also Kesef, as long as it is significant.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like "Kelim" connotes two, also "Kesef" refers to two (coins);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like Kesef is important, also Kelim must be important.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Regarding Ma'aser Sheni it says "v'Tzarta ha'Kesef b'Yadecha";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one wants to transfer Kedushah (of Perutos) of Ma'aser Sheni to a Sela... (This shows that one was able to redeem onto Perutos!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Kesef" twice, to include smaller money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> Regarding Hekdesh it says "v'Nasan ha'Kesef v'Kam Lo" (these words are taken from different verses);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one redeemed Hekdesh worth a Maneh on something worth (Shaveh) a Perutah, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn Hekdesh from a Gezeirah Shavah "Kodesh-Kodesh" from Ma'aser Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> We learn that money can be Mekadesh a woman from "v'Yatz'ah Chinam Ein Kasef";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> A Dinar or Shavah Dinar makes Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel say, a Perutah or Shavah Perutah makes Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Is R. Asi's teaching like Beis Shamai?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Correction - Rav Asi):</span> Whenever the Torah fixed a quantity of money, it is Tzuri;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All money of Rabbinic decree is standard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learn this from our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (The following are in Maneh Tzuri -) five Sela'im of Pidyon ha'Ben...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Asi's Chidush is the Seifa, that all money of Rabbinic decree is standard.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Toke'a Shimon (hit his ear; alternatively, blew in his ear), he pays one Sela.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One might have thought that this is a Sela Tzuri, four Zuz. R. Asi teaches that it is a standard Sela, a half-Zuz, which people call "Sela."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Chanan Bisha was Toke'a (hit; alternatively blew in the ear of) Ploni. Rav Huna obligated him to pay a half Dinar. Chanan had a rubbed out Dinar, and people did not accept it. He was Toke'a Ploni again, and gave him the Dinar.</p>
