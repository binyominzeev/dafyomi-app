<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>RAV'S OPINION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rav really permit this on Yom Tov (because it is a Davar she'Eino Miskaven)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Chiya bar Ashi said that Rav forbids plugging up a barrel tightly on Yom Tov (with rags around the plug, even though he does not intend to squeeze out liquid)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is different. Even R. Shimon (who permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven) forbids that!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> Even R. Shimon forbids a Pesik Reisha (something that will definitely result in a transgression. It is as if he intends to do it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chiya bar Ashi said that Rav rules like R. Yehudah (who forbids Davar she'Eino Miskaven). R. Chanan bar Ami said that Shmuel rules like R. Shimon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Chiya bar Avin concurred that these rulings were said in the names of Rav and Shmuel, but not that they were transmitted by Rav Chiya bar Ashi and Rav Chanan bar Ami.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and retraction of the original understanding of Question 3:e, 24b):</span> Really, Rav forbids Davar she'Eino Miskaven. Uprooting is not considered shearing;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is permitted on Yom Tov because it is an abnormal way of uprooting something from where it grows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Uprooting is considered shearing!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If (b'Shogeg) one plucked a feather from a bird's wing, then was Kotem (cut off the end), then smoothed it (trimmed its "hair"), he must bring three Chata'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Plucking is liable due to (it is a derivative of the Av Melachah of) shearing, Kotem is liable due to Mechatech (cutting to a specific size), smoothing is liable due to Memachek (smearing).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is liable for plucking from a wing, for this is normal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> Since Rav holds like R. Yosi ben ha'Meshulam, R. Yosi must hold like Rav (i.e. he forbids Davar she'Eino Miskaven. Tosfos - if not, perhaps R. Yosi permits in the Mishnah only without intent to uproot, for he holds that this is a normal way of uprooting something from where it grows, unlike Rav.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ben ha'Meshulam):</span> If a Parah Adumah has two hairs that are red at the root and black at the end (our text; Tosfos' text - black at the root and red at the end), one may cut them (to be Machshir it) with a scissors. He need not be concerned (for the Isur of shearing).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Isur of shearing does not apply to cattle (for they do not have wool).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa):</span> "Lo Sa'avod bi'Vechor Shorecha v'Lo Sagoz Bechor Tzonecha" forbids working with a Bechor ox and shearing a Bechor Seh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to forbid working with a Bechor Seh and shearing a Bechor ox?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo Sa'avod... <i>v</i>'Lo Sagoz." (The "Vav" connects the Lavim to teach that both apply to the same (i.e. both) animals.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Isur of shearing does not apply to Parah Adumah, for it is Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar taught that one may not shear or work with Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Isur is only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In any case, it is forbidden mid'Rabanan! (Why does R. Yosi permit it?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because Parah Adumah is uncommon, Chachamim did not decree.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It would be better to redeem it, cut the hairs and be Mekadesh it again!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is very expensive. (It is unlikely that enough money is available to redeem it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should redeem it for a Perutah, like Shmuel's teaching!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If Hekdesh of any value was redeemed onto a Perutah, the Hekdesh becomes Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel's law is b'Di'eved. One may not do so l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Text of R. Gershom and Shitah Mekubetzes - Answer #3):</span> The Isur of shearing cattle applies only to the tail.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (or 4):</span> Our assumption (g) was wrong. Rav holds like R. Yosi, but R. Yosi does not hold like Rav. He permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE HETER TO REMOVE HAIR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He uproots the hair, but must not move it. (He leaves it caught in the attached hair.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> This must be done by hand, but not with a Kli.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> He makes room (for Shechitah) on both sides with a Kopitz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should say 'he makes room on both sides <i>for</i> a Kopitz.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The same applies to one who uproots hair to inspect a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this teach about l'Chatchilah (one may uproot hair to inspect a Mum), or b'Di'eved (if one uprooted hair to inspect a Mum, he must not move it, like one who did so for Shechitah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah - Beraisa - R. Yosi ben ha'Meshulam):</span> If (there is a Mum in a Bechor's ear and) wool is tangled in the ear, one uproots the wool to inspect the Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that this is l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Mari):</span> We already learn this from our Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, one uproots hair to inspect a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "similarly"?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This teaches that (if hair was uprooted to inspect a Mum,) it may not be moved.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even when hair was uprooted for Shechitah (which clearly shows he did not intend for the hair), it may not be moved. All the more so when it was uprooted to inspect a Mum (which does not prove what his intention was) one may not move it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Similarly, it is permitted to uproot the hair, i.e. l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE DECREE TO FORBID HAIR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If hair of a Bechor Ba'al Mum fell out and was put in the window, and then it was slaughtered, Akavya ben Mahalal'el permits the hair;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim forbid it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> Akavya does not permit in this case, rather, when the hair fell out and was put in the window, and then the Bechor died.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If dangling wool (it is detached from the skin, but it still clings to the attached wool) of a Bechor is Nir'eh (seen) with the attached wool (this will be explained), it is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it sticks out, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> R. Yosi holds that Akavya forbids (hair in the window after Shechitah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If he permits after death (without Shechitah, when the Bechor is totally forbidden), all the more so he should permit after Shechitah (when the Bechor is totally permitted)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Yosi means that the argument (Akavya permits, and Chachamim forbid) is not about a slaughtered Bechor. There, all permit;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, they argue about a Bechor that died.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Asi citing Reish Lakish):</span> Akavya and Chachamim argue when an expert (saw the Mum and) permitted the Bechor. Chachamim say that we decree lest one delay slaughtering it (to gain hair that will fall). Akavya does not decree;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If an expert did not permit it, all forbid the hair.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> A Ba'al Mum forbids any quantity (of animals with which it became mixed);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi says, one checks.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot mean to check which is the Ba'al Mum and to remove it. Surely, the first Tana would not argue with this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> The case is, shearings of a Bechor became mixed with Chulin shearings;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The first Tana is R. Yehudah, who says that Chachamim forbid shearings (even) after the animal was slaughtered. R. Yosi says that Chachamim permit in this case;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yosi says, <i>it is checked</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We check whether the Mum is permanent. (If it is, the shearings are permitted, even though they fell before an expert permitted the animal. This refutes Reish Lakish!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (and Answer to Question (4) - Rava):</span> No, we check whether an expert permitted the animal before the shearings fell. If so, they are permitted. If not, they are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yirmeyah):</span> These Chachamim of Bavel err. They did not hear how R. Yochanan explains the Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Questions (h) and (h:2) - R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> The argument in the Beraisa is when they checked all the animals for the Ba'al Mum and did not find it, they argue like the following Tana'im:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> (If a grave was lost in a field and the entire field was checked and the grave was not found,) anything Muchzak to be Tamei (i.e. the entire field, mi'Safek) keeps its Chazakah until the Tum'ah is found;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say one digs until finding a big rock or virgin soil (we are not concerned lest there is Tum'ah underneath).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> The argument is when they checked some animals and found a Ba'al Mum, they argue like the following Tana'im:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> (If a grave was lost in a field,) one who enters the field is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If a grave was found in the field, one who enters the field is Tahor - we assume that it is the same one that was lost.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says the entire field must be checked (if not, one who enters is Tamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Asi, why didn't R. Yochanan explain like R. Chiya bar Aba explains?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Tum'ah, we can say that a raven or mouse took it, but the Ba'al Mum did not go away!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Refutation:</span> R. Chiya bar Aba, though, will explain that it might have been a healable Mum, which healed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Chiya, why didn't R. Yochanan explain like R. Asi explains?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is normal to bury a Mes in a field - we know that one was buried here, perhaps another also (and we found the other);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When a Ba'al Mum became mixed with animals that were checked, we need not suspect that one of the others got a Mum!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Asi argues - since animals gore each other, it is common to get a Mum.</p></div>
