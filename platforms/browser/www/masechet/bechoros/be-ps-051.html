<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN SHAVEH KESEF MAY BE USED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The 30 Shekalim for a slave, the 50 of a rapist or seducer...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah repeat 'they are Maneh Tzuri'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is due to a rapist and Motzi Shem Ra;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In those Parshiyos it does not say 'Shekalim'. One might have thought that Zuzim are given. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. We learn from places where it says "Shekalim".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (All can be paid with money or Shaveh Kesef,) except for (half-)Shekalim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (Money or Shaveh Kesef can be used for any obligation,) except for (half-)Shekalim, (redemption of) Ma'aser Sheni and Re'ayon (Olas Re'iyah that one must bring on each festival. the same applies to the Shelamim one must bring.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Shekalim, a Mishnah teaches that to facilitate bringing Shekalim to Yerushalayim, they may be converted to gold coins (but not gems. Only currency is guaranteed to retain its value);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding Ma'aser Sheni it says "v'Tzarta ha'Kesef b'Yadcha";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> Shaveh Kesef (or even a silver nugget) may not be brought to the Azarah to buy Re'ayon, lest it not be worth the required Shi'ur (the Olah and Shelamim must be worth one and two Ma'ah, respectively).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not redeem with slaves, documents, land or Hekdesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If Reuven wrote a document to a Kohen saying 'I owe you five Shekalim (for Pidyon ha'Ben)', his son is not redeemed, and he must pay;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, if the Kohen wants (the Yisrael to keep his money, the only solution is that the Kohen takes it, and then) he may return the money.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>If Reuven separated money for Pidyon ha'Ben and it was lost, he has Acharayus (he must give other money to a Kohen). It says "Yihyeh Lach" (a Kohen will receive the money,) and (only then he is redeemed -) "Pado Sifdeh".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Our Mishnah is unlike Rebbi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Anything may be given for Pidyon ha'Ben, except for documents.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds Ribuy and Mi'ut (inclusions and exclusions):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"U'Fduyav mi'Ben Chodesh" is a Ribuy. "B'Erkecha Kesef Chameshes Shekalim" is a Mi'ut; "Tifdeh" is another Ribuy. We have a Ribuy Mi'ut Ribuy;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Ribuyim include everything. The Mi'ut excludes just one thing, i.e. documents.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim expound Klal u'Frat (general terms and specific terms);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"U'Fduyav mi'Ben Chodesh" is a Klal. "B'Erkecha Kesef Chameshes Shekalim" is a Prat; "Tifdeh" is another Klal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>From a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal we learn everything similar to the Prat, in this case Metaltelim with intrinsic value;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This excludes land (it is not movable), slaves (it is equated to land) and documents (they have no intrinsic value).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Rebbi expounds Klal u'Frat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> "Martze'a" (an awl is used to pierce the ear of a slave). What is the source to include a wood chip, thorn, needle, drill or stylus?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Lakachta" includes anything that may be taken in the hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rebbi says, just like Martze'a is of metal, any metal Kli may be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi expounds Klal u'Frat, and R. Yosi bar Yehudah expound Ribuy and Mi'ut.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mereimar):</span> Indeed, normally Rebbi expounds Klal u'Frat. Here is different, like Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Ba'Mayim... ba'Mayim" (teaches about in which bodies of water we may eat fish only with fins and scales). Because the Prat is not between the Kelalim, we do not expound according to Klal u'Frat, rather, according to Ribuy u'Mi'ut;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, when the Prat is not between the Kelalim, we put it between and expound according to Klal u'Frat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not redeem with Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious. Hekdesh does not belong to the one who wants to redeem!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">51b----------------------------------------51b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means that also Hekdesh cannot be redeemed with slaves, documents or land.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>REDEEMING WITH DOCUMENTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven wrote a document to a Kohen saying 'I owe you five Shekalim', his son is not redeemed, and he must pay.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Mid'Oraisa, his son is redeemed when he pays;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim decreed that he is not redeemed, lest people say that documents may be used to redeem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> His son is redeemed when he pays.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Your Stam (anonymous) Beraisa is like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah (some say like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon), but Chachamim say that he is not redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>RETURNING THE MONEY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Therefore, the Kohen may return the money if he wants.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Our Mishnah teaches like (the Seifa of) the following Beraisa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one gave five Shekalim (in all) to 10 Kohanim at once, he fulfilled the Mitzvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he gave to one after the other, he fulfilled the Mitzvah. (Rambam - he gave to 10 Kohanim; Tzon Kodoshim's text of Rashi, based on Tosefta 6:4 - he gave the coins to one Kohen, one after the other.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the Kohen took the money and returned it, the Pidyon is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Tarfon used to do so. Chachamim heard, and said 'he fulfilled this law.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this the only law that R. Tarfon fulfilled?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he fulfilled <i>even</i> this law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>R. Chanina used to take the money and return it. Once, he saw a man lingering around after giving the money (to get it back).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> I see that you did not intend to give it. You acted wrongly;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Your son is not redeemed! (I.e. some explain 'if I would return your money, your son would not be redeemed.')</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ACHARAYUS FOR PIDYON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven separated money for Pidyon ha'Ben and it was lost, he has Acharayus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Erech-Erech" from Erchin. (Just like there is Acharayus for Erchin, also for Pidyon ha'Ben.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It says "v'Chol Bechor Banecha Tifdeh v'Lo Yera'u Fanai Reikam." We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Reikam-Reikam" from Olas Re'iyah (that one must bring on each Regel). Just like there is Acharayus for Olas Re'iyah, also for Pidyon ha'Ben.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (to both of them - Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah itself gives a (different) source!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> We learn from "Yihyeh Lach Ach Pado Sifdeh" (like the Mishnah says);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Reish Lakish (and R. Yochanan) explained a previous Mishnah (49a).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Peter Rechem died after 30 days, even if his father had not yet given five Shekalim, he must give now.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> We learn "Erech-Erech" from Erchin. (Even if the Ne'erach died, the Ma'arich must pay. Likewise, once the father was obligated, death of the son does not exempt him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> We learn "Reikam-Reikam" from Olas Re'iyah. Just like there is Acharayus for obligatory Olos, also for Pidyon ha'Ben.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>FROM WHAT DOES A BECHOR RECEIVE A DOUBLE PORTION?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Bechor receives a double portion of his father's property, but not of his mother's;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>(If the value of his father's property increased after death and before dividing the estate), the Bechor does not receive a double portion of the Shevach (increased value);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The double portion applies only to what was Muchzak (owned at the time of death) to his father, but not to what was only Ra'uy (destined to come to him, e.g. a debt or inheritance).</p></div>
