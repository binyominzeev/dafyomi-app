<p class="dedicationbox">BECHOROS 57 (15 Teves) - dedicated by Dr. Moshe and Rivka Snow in memory of Rivka's mother, Rebbetzin Leah bas Rav Yosef (Rabinowitz), the Manostrishtcher Rebbetzin, whose Yahrzeit is 15 Teves. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES <i>BEREIRAH</i> APPLY TO DIVISIONS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>This is like R. Yochanan taught elsewhere;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If brothers divide an inheritance, they are like buyers (everyone took a share in exchange for his true portion). They must return their shares and redivide in Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yochanan needed to teach both laws;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he taught only about Ma'aser, one might have thought that he is exempt because Ma'aser must resemble a son, i.e. one knows which child was born to him (or his animals), but only sales are returned in Yovel, but not inheritances or gifts;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had he taught only about returning land, one might have thought that this is a stringency (because he is unsure whether Yesh Breirah), and we are stringent also to take Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Alternatively, had he taught only about returning land, one might have thought that this is because Yovel mandates returning to the original status (before division), but brothers are obligated to take Ma'aser (because Yesh Bereirah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if two partners divided, and Reuven took 10 sheep and Shimon took nine sheep and a dog:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven's sheep are all Pesulim for Korbanos (each is a Safek Mechir Kelev. Perhaps it was in exchange for the dog.) Shimon's sheep are Kesherim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Yesh Breirah, we should be able to pick one of Reuven's sheep to be in exchange for the dog, and the rest will be Kesherim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Indeed, if all the animals are worth the same, we may do so;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, the dog is worth more than one of Reuven's sheep. Each of Reuven's sheep is worth slightly more than each of Shimon's. In all, they compensate for the extra value of the dog. Each is partially in exchange for the dog.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ANIMALS EXEMPT FROM <i>MA'ASER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All (Tahor Behemos) enter the pen for Ma'aser, except for the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kil'ayim, Terefah, Yotzei Dofen, Mechusar Zeman, and Yasom, i.e. an animal born after its mother died or was slaughtered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehoshua says, even if the mother was slaughtered, if the skin is intact the child is not a Yasom. (This will be explained.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Shor Oh Chesev" excludes Kil'ayim. "Oh Ez" excludes Nidmeh. "Ki Yivaled" excludes Yotzei Dofen. "Shiv'as Yamim" excludes Mechusar Zeman. "Tachas Imo" excludes Yasom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yishmael ben R. Yochanan ben Brokah says, it says "Tachas ha'Shevet" regarding Ma'aser, and "Tachas Imo" regarding (other) Kodshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like all of the above are Pasul for Kodshim, they are Pasul (and do not enter the pen for) Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like Terefah does not enter the pen for Ma'aser (this will be explained), it is Pasul for Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says "All (enter the pen)." What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> The following enter the pen for Ma'aser:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rove'a and Nirva (an animal that had relations with a woman or man), Muktzah (an animal designated to be offered to idolatry), Ne'evad (one that was worshipped), Esnan, Mechir Kelev, Tumtum and Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, Tumtum and Androginus do not enter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Tana of our Mishnah learns the Gezeirah Shavah "Tachas-Tachas" from Kodshim, he should also exclude all of these;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he does not learn the Gezeirah Shavah, what is his source for what he excludes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns the Gezeirah Shavah. A verse includes these (that they enter the pen for Ma'aser):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Ki Mashchasam Bahem Mum Bam" - "Mashchasam" always refers to sexual immorality and idolatry (and these are equated to Mumim);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Sexual immorality - "Hishchis (this is from the same root as Mashchasam) Kol Basar Es Darko";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Idolatry - "Pen Tashchisun va'Asisem Lachem Pesel".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Mum does not disqualify from (entering the pen for) Ma'aser, for it says "Lo Yevaker Bein Tov la'Ra." Therefore, also Ervah (Rove'a, Nirva and Esnan) and idolatry (Muktzah and Ne'evad) do not disqualify;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Mechir Kelev is equated to Esnan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Our Tana holds that Tumtum and Androginus are Sefekos (males or females. In any case they are Kosher for Korbanos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text):</span> R. Shimon agrees that they are Sefekos. They are invalid for Kodshim, for a definite male or female is required;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> R. Shimon holds that they are special creations (neither male nor female). Every Korban must be a male or female; (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We learn Ma'aser from Kodshim from the Gezeirah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Yehudah citing R. Yehoshua):</span> All enter the pen for Ma'aser, except for Kil'ayim and Terefah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Akiva says, R. Yehoshua excludes also Yotzei Dofen, Mechusar Zeman and Yasom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the first Tana learns the Gezeirah Shavah, he should exclude also what R. Akiva excludes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he does not learn it, granted, he has a source to exclude Terefah - "Kol Asher Ya'avor Tachas ha'Shevet." (R. Gershom - it is too weak; Rashi - this excludes a Terefah whose leg was cut off above the knee. Likewise, all Terefos are excluded. Rashash - a healthy animal crouches "Tachas" when one presses on it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, what is his source for Kil'ayim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from the Gezeirah Shavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Yotzei Dofen, he holds like R. Shimon, who considers it like a regular birth (with regard to Tum'as Yoledes);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">57b----------------------------------------57b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is unlike R. Yochanan (who says that R. Shimon agrees that Yotzei Dofen is Pasul for Kodshim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding Mechusar Zeman, he holds like R. Shimon (who says that it enters the pen for Ma'aser);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He says that Yasom is tithed if the mother's skin is intact, like R. Yehoshua said in our Mishnah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> Even if the mother was slaughtered, if the skin is intact the child is not a Yasom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Yishmael ben Sasri'el testified about the following things in his locale:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When we see that an animal will die while giving birth, we flay her skin and wrap the baby in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rebbi remarked that this reveals R. Yehoshua's reason. (It is as if its mother is still alive.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Lettuces have 600,000 layers of leaves in the part resembling Beis ha'Masas (a stomach of ruminants that has layers);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Once, a cedar tree fell, and 16 wagons traveled across its length, side by side on its circumference. (It was so wide that it barely sloped over such a wide area, so the wagons did not topple. Maharsha - this refers to the death of Moshe. The sharp Pilpul (analytical reasoning) that he gave to Yisrael was passed down for 16 generations.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Once, an egg of a Bar Yuchni (giant bird) fell. The contents flooded 60 great cities and broke 300 cedars. (Maharsha - this alludes to the breaking of the Luchos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Bar Yuchni does not drop its eggs - "Kenaf Renanim <i>Ne'ELaSaH</i>"! (We expound this Nosei OLeh v'NiSCHatei, it goes up and gently lays its egg down into its nest)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The mother dropped it because it was spoiled.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>GERANOS FOR MA'ASAR BEHEMAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> There are three Geranos for Ma'aser Behemah (times during the year when one must tithe his animals) - Pras (15 days before) Pesach, Pras Shavu'os, and Pras Sukos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Ben Azai says, the Geranos are Adar 29, Sivan 1, and Av 29;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Elazar and R. Shimon say, they are Nisan 1, Sivan 1, and Elul 29.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do they say Elul 29, and not Tishrei 1?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One may not tithe on Yom Tov (Rosh Hashanah), therefore we tithe the day before.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Meir says, Elul 1 is Rosh Hashanah for Ma'aser Behemah. (Animals born from Elul 1 until (but not including) Elul 1 of next year are tithed together.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Ben Azai says, Elulim (animals born in Elul) are tithed by themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>All animals born between Tishrei 1 and Elul 29 are tithed together (this is like R. Elazar and R. Shimon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If five animals were born before Rosh Hashanah and five after Rosh Hashanah, they do not join.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If five animals were born before the Goren and five after the Goren, they join.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why are there three Geranos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Before the Goren, one may sell or slaughter animals that were not tithed. After the Goren, this is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one slaughtered, he is exempt.</p>
