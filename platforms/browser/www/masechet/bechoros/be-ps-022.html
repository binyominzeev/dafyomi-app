<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the cake be buried?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is to publicize that the mother is exempt from Bechorah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The cake is a proper child.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why isn't the cake Metamei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The (dissolved) fetus is Batel in a majority of blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This is like he taught elsewhere;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov (in our Mishnah) and R. Shimon taught the same thing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Shilya is in a house, the house is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A Shilya is not considered a (dead) child (to be Metamei). Rather, it is always accompanied by a child.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Shimon says, perhaps the child was dissolved before the Shilya left the mother (the house is Tahor).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PESICHAS HA'KEVER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Pesichas ha'Kever (once a woman begins to give birth to a Nefel, it is Metamei the house as if it were already born) applies only if the head was at least as big as a Pikah (lump).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Pikah does this refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> It is the ball at the end of knitting needle for woolen thread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Chiya bar Rav):</span> Do you refer to (a needle for) warp threads, or (for) woof threads? (The latter is larger.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The head must be like the Pikah of a warp needle;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah requires the size of a Pikah for woof;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok says, Pesichas ha'Kever applies (regarding of the head size), if Tefifiyos are seen in the womb.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Tefifiyos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel citing R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok):</span> It is a crease twice the size of a Pikah, like when a mule bends to urinate.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> I heard that two laws depend on a Pikah, one of warp and one of woof. I cannot explain this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> I heard that three laws depend on a Pikah. One is of warp, one is of woof, and one is of a large Pikah of sackmakers. I cannot explain this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> Pesichas ha'Kever applies if the head is as big as a warp Pikah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Pikah of woof is the Shi'ur for Pesichas ha'Kever of animals. (A Nefel inside an animal is Balu'ah (swallowed). It is not Metamei (b'Maga u'Masa) until Pesichas ha'Kever.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The last Shi'ur applies to the following Mishnah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a clod of earth from a Beis ha'Pras (a field in which a corpse was plowed. We are concerned lest the plow dragged bones) or from Chutz la'Aretz is the size of a large Pikah of sackmakers, it is Metamei b'Ohel.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This is the same size as the seal of large sacks, and on the top cover of barrels of Beis Lechem.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CAN TUM'AH BE REVIVED AFTER BITUL?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If one buys brine from an Am ha'Aretz (who is not trustworthy about Taharah), he may do Hashakah (connect it to a Mikveh). This is Metaher it, in any case:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the majority (Tosfos -- or even half) is water, Hashakah is Metaher water;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the majority is brine, brine is not Mekabel Tum'ah, and the water is Batel in the majority.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> This is Metaher the brine to use it for a dip (i.e. water will not be added);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he will (add water, e.g.) cook it in a pot, and altogether there will be more water than brine, this arouses the Tum'ah. (Rashi -- it is Metamei the brine; Tosfos -- (only) the water returns to its Tum'ah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> After Tum'ah was Batel, does it really return?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> Surely, you agree that it does!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a Se'ah of Tamei Terumah fell into 100 Sa'im of Chulin, we take one Se'ah from the mixture and let it rot;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>(Mid'Oraisa, the Terumah was Batel. Chachamim require removing a Se'ah.) We consider the Se'ah removed to be the one that fell in.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, the Se'ah removed (is given to a Kohen. It and the mixture) may be eaten in any of the following ways (so it cannot become Tamei):</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Dry (so it is not Huchshar to be Mekabel Tum'ah), parched, kneaded with fruit juice (which is not Machshir), or divided into small doughs, each less than the size of an egg. (Rishonim argue about whether an egg is the Shi'ur for Hechsher, or for a Tamei food to be Metamei food, or to be Mekabel Tum'as Ochlin mid'Oraisa.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> According to R. Eliezer, the Chulin (the remainder after removing a Se'ah) may be eaten dry, parched, kneaded with fruit juice, or divided into small doughs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ula):</span> (Chachamim consider everything to be (Tahor) Chulin, through Bitul, and R. Eliezer considers the remainder to be Chulin.) Why must it be eaten dry (or parched, etc.)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> This is a decree, lest one join this Chulin to a slightly smaller volume of Tamei food to be Mevatel it (thinking that the Tum'ah will be the minority);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Really, since some of this Chulin is Tamei, it joins with the Tamei food, and the Tum'ah is aroused.</p></div>
