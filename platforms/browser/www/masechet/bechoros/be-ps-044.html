<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>MUMIM</i> OF THE EYES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Both of his eyes are above; both are below...  (these are Pesulim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "His eyes are above" means that (when his eyes are straight,) he sees above. "His eyes are below" means that he sees below. "One is above and one is below" means, one eye sees above and one sees below.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, this (third) case is identical to the fourth "he can see the first and second floors at the same time"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, "his eyes are above (or below)" means that his eyes are higher (or lower) on his face than is normal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if his eyes are in the usual place, if he sees the first and second floors at the same time; he is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "B'Eino" (is extra. This) includes any abnormality in the eye:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Both eyes are above, or both are below, or one is above and one is below, or he can see the first and second floors at the same time, or if he talks with Reuven (and looks at him) and Shimon says "He is looking at me."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Iver" refers to one who is blind in one or both eyes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Chavarvar and a constant drip?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Ish Iver."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why must the Torah say "Ish Iver... Dak Oh Tevalul b'Eino"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All of these are needed:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it said only "Iver," we would be Posel only one who lacks an eye, but not Chavarvar and a constant drip, for he has two eyes. Therefore, it says "Ish";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it added only "Ish," we would be Posel only one who cannot see at all, but not one whose vision is impaired. Therefore, it says "Dak";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had it added only "Dak," we would be Posel only one whose vision is impaired, but not if the a protrusion of white enters the black. (The vision is not impaired.) Therefore, it says "Tevalul";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Had it added only "Tevalul," we would Posel only a protrusion into the black, but not a mere abnormality (of their location, or the ability to see different places at once) - therefore, it says "b'Eino."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion (Rava):</span> Anyone who cannot see at all is Pasul due to "Ish";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anyone whose vision is impaired is Pasul due to "Dak". Any protrusion into the black is Pasul due to "Tevalul". Any abnormality is Pasul due to "b'Eino."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Sachei Shemesh, (Zagdan,... )</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The text should say "Sanei Shemesh" (one who hates sunlight. He cannot look where the sun shines.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>To illustrate "Zagdiyan," Rav Huna said "one of my eyes, and one of his" (Rav Yehudah was sitting in front of him); Rav Yehudah was upset. (Rashi - Rav Huna's eyes were normal, Rav Yehudah's eyes were not; Tosfos - Rav Yehudah's eyes were understandably bigger than Rav Huna's, for Rav Yehudah was much taller.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Shechevna" is one whose eyebrows rest on his eyes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Zagdum is when one eyebrow is black, and the other is white.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana calls any difference between a pair (that should be identical) "Zagdum."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Tziran.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (The following are Pesulim:)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Tziran -) his eyes are round; Tziraniyos (Rashi - they are very round; R. Gershom - the socket is round);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>His eyes tear, drip, or constantly drip.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (The following are Pesulim:)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Zavir - his eyes constantly move (alternatively - twitch);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Lufin - his eyelashes are very long;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Tamir - he has no eyelashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This Beraisa discusses (proper) Mumim. Our Mishnah disqualifies one without eyelashes only due to Mar'is ha'Ayin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses when there is a remnant of the hairs. The Beraisa discusses when there is no remnant.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FACIAL <i>MUMIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Pesulim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His eyes are as big as a calf's eyes, or (see Insights) as small as a goose's eyes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>His body is (disproportionately) big compared to his limbs (arms and legs), or too small;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>His nose is big compared to his limbs, or too small.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Tzome'a - his ears are too small;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Tzomem - his ears are spongy (shrivelled and closed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the upper jaw extends past the lower jaw, or vice-versa, it is a Mum;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If his teeth fell out, he is Pasul due to Mar'is ha'Ayin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> Moshe was 10 Amos tall - "va'Yifros Es ha'Ohel Al ha'Mishkan";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To spread the curtains over the boards, he had to be as tall as them, i.e. 10 Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Simi):</span> If so, he was a Ba'al Mum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> His body is big compared to his limbs. (A normal person's shoulder is three times as tall as his Amah (lower arm). Rav Simi understood that Moshe's height was 10 times his own (normal sized) Amah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Moshe's height was 10 (standard) Amos. (Surely, this was three times his own Amah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> His nose is big (compared to his limbs, or too small).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rambam - (Beraisa):</span> It should be the length of his pinky.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rashi - (Beraisa):</span> If it is too big or small (compared to noses of other people of his size), and the excess or deficit is the width of his pinky (he is Pasul).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Tzimem and Tzome'a...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Also Tzime'ach is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabanan did not know what this is. They heard a merchant announce "who wants Tzime'ach?" He was selling a goat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn that Tzime'ach refers to long droopy ears.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AN ANIMAL MISSING HORNS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a goat lacks horns, or if a ewe has horns, this does not disqualify it for a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> The following resemble Mumim but are not Mumim. Such a Korban may be offered on the Mizbe'ach, but it may not be slaughtered outside;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a goat lacks horns, or if a ewe has horns;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Tzime'ach, Tzimem or Tzome'a. (We must say that the Mishnah disqualified such Kohanim only because they are unlike Zera Aharon.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a Korban's horns were removed with the inner bone, it is Pasul, but it may not be redeemed (until it gets a proper Mum);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If its hooves were removed with the inner bone, it is Pasul, and it may be redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If its horns or hooves were removed with the inner bone, it is Pasul, and it may be redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses when they were totally uprooted, and there is no remnant. Rav Chisda discusses when they were cut, and the roots remain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the roots remain it is Kosher!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the horns or hooves of a Parah Adumah were black (this disqualifies it), they may be cut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ze'iri):</span> If the outermost part of the horns or hooves are cut, without cutting the inner bone, it is Kosher.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE MAY NOT DELAY URINATING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Pasul:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A man who has humps like breasts, or his stomach is swollen, or his navel sticks out;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He has epileptic fits, even once in a while (R. Gershom - at predictable times), or if a spirit of Kaztris (this will be explained) overcomes him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He is Me'ushvan or Ba'al Gever (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Aba brei d'R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> One may pass water (urinate) in public. One should not drink water in public. (Rashi - it is improper for a Chacham to eat or drink in public. Tosfos - even if one does not drink water in public (only water is forbidden, people do not drink it together), he may pass water in public. Iyun Yakov - even though one may drink urine for a cure, one may not do so in public.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One may pass water in public, but one should not drink water in public;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in which a man needed to urinate, but he delayed. His stomach swelled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Once, Shmuel needed to urinate while he was teaching. They spread a sheet to give him privacy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">His father:</span> I will pay you 400 Zuz to reverse what you did (i.e. urinate in front of them - R. Gershom; Rashi - teach that one may not delay until he can urinate with privacy);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You were able to urinate with privacy, but your Talmidim would not be able to (while you are teaching). Perhaps they will endanger themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Mar bar Rav Ashi was crossing a bridge. He needed to urinate. They told him that his mother-in-law was coming; he said, even if he had to urinate in her ear (Maharsha - right next to her), he would do so and not endanger himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said that once, a man's stomach swelled because he needed to urinate, but he delayed. Perhaps it swelled because he drank a leech!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Afterwards, he could not urinate normally. Only drops would come out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are two holes in the Ever. One of them is for urine, and the other is for semen. They are separated by the thickness of a garlic peel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a man delays urinating, the separation could be broken, and make him sterile.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> Why does it say "Lo Yihyeh Vecha Akar v'Akarah uvi'Vhemtecha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> You will not be sterile if you are like an animal (unashamed to urinate in public if necessary).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> You will not be barren of Talmidim, and your prayers (Rashi - for children) will not be rejected. if you make yourself (Tosfos - humble) like an animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> (In Bavel, even today, after the Churban,) one should not urinate in a urinal (which people empty into the river) or on a hard place (where it will not be absorbed, and will flow into the river);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chani):</span> The inclined places of Bavel lead water to Ein Eitam (a spring that runs through the Mikdash. The Kohen Gadol would immerse in it on Yom Kipur. R. Gershom - people in Eretz Yisrael drink from it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> A woman should not urinate right in front of a baby. (Even if she does not expose herself, it is brazenness.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>EXCESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If a bowel movement started to leave and returned to the body, this can cause Hidrokan (swelling of the stomach);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If urine started to leave and returned, this can cause jaundice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> If one has too much blood (does not let blood enough), this can cause boils;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Too much semen (a married man who does not have relations with his wife) can cause Tzara'as;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Containing one's self from defecating or urinating until his body had an excess of waste material can cause Hidrokan or jaundice, respectively.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A spirit of Kaztris overcomes him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> It is insanity due to a Shed (demon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Me'ushvan or Ba'al Gever.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Meshuvan has large Beitzim. Ba'al Gever has a big Ever.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Meshuvan is Kayin. Garavtan is Ba'al Gever.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How big is Posel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Shi'ur (Rashi - for the Ever; Rambam - or for the sac that holds the Beitzim) is until the knee.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> If it reaches to the knee, he is Pasul. If it does not reach the knee, he is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Some say, if it reaches no further than the knee, he is Kosher. If it reaches below the knee, he is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>MERU'ACH ASHECH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Meru'ach Ashech is one who has no Beitzim or only one;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yishmael, says it is one whose Beitzim were dissolved;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says, it is one whose Beitzim are inflated;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Chanina ben Antignos says, it is one of dark appearance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> R. Yishmael does not learn like the first Tana, for if so it should have said "Chaser Ashech";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva does not learn like R. Yishmael, for if so it should have said "mi'Miru'ach Ashech";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Chanina does not learn like R. Akiva, for if so it should have said "Ru'ach Ashech";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Chanina expounds through switching letters from one word to another. (He puts the letter Ches of "Meru'ach" at the beginning of "Ashech," and the Aleph of "Ashech" at the end of "Meru'ach". We read it like "Mar'av Chashech," i.e. his appearance is dark).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, this is a Kushi (negro, which is taught in the Mishnah on 45b)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Mishnah is unlike R. Chanina. (He would not list Kushi below, for he already taught it here.) </p>
