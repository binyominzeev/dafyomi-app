<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT MAKES THE TENTH <i>KODESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar ben Gomel):</span> It says "v'Nechshav Lachem Terumaschem (ka'Dagan Min ha'Goren)." Terumas<i>chem</i> refers to (and equates) two Terumos, i.e. Terumah Gedolah and Terumas Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Terumah Gedolah is taken by estimation and may be designated with mere intent (without an action or words), also Terumas Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ma'aser (of grain) is called Terumah - "Ki Es Ma'asar Bnei Yisrael Asher Yarimu la'Shem Terumah Nasati la'Leviyim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Just like Ma'aser of grain is taken by estimation and with mere intent, also Ma'aser Behemah (Rashi Kesav Yad - can be taken without counting).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The tenth is Kodesh automatically (even if he did not call it Asiri. Alternatively, it is Kodesh even if it did not leave the pen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa) Question:</span> Perhaps this is only if he called it "Asiri". What is the source to include if he did not do so?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yihyeh Kodesh" in any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the case is, he did not call it "Asiri," but called it "Kodesh". (Alternatively, perhaps it is Kodesh to forbid eating it without a Mum, but it is not offered.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If he (mistakenly) called the ninth "Asiri," and was silent when the tenth left, the ninth is eaten when it gets a Mum, and the tenth is Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Perhaps that is different, for the tenth did leave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Perhaps the case is, he pointed to show that it is the tenth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> If he called the ninth "Asiri," and the tenth died in the pen, the ninth is eaten when it gets a Mum, and the first eight are exempt from Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The first eight are exempt because the tenth became Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, Minyan ha'Ra'uy (when they left, the pen contained enough to complete the count of 10) exempted them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Minyan ha'Ra'uy exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa #1):</span> If he called the ninth "Asiri," and the tenth remained in the pen, the ninth is eaten when it gets a Mum, and the tenth is Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> The ninth is Chulin. (It may be eaten immediately.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (a reciter of Beraisos):</span> Beraisa #2 is like R. Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> The ninth is not Kodesh unless (the name of) the tenth was Ne'ekar (it was called something else, e.g. ninth).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">59b----------------------------------------59b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Kal va'Chomer supports this. The 11th gets Kedushas Hakravah (it is offered like a Shelamim if it was called tenth), but only if the tenth was Ne'ekar. The Kedushah of the ninth is not for Hakravah (rather, just to forbid it without a Mum), all the more so this is only if the tenth was Ne'ekar!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Just the contrary! Because the Kedushah of the 11th is for Hakravah, this is only if the tenth was Ne'ekar. The Kedushah of the ninth is not for Hakravah, so this can happen even if the tenth was not Ne'ekar! (Rashi attributes these rejections to the Gemara. Rashi Kesav Yad attributes them to Chachamim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Because the tenth was determined before the 11th, the 11th gets Kedushah only if the tenth was Ne'ekar. (If not, the 11th is like the first of the next 10. Calling it Asiri has no effect.) However, the ninth was called Asiri before the tenth was determined. This can happen even if the tenth will not be Ne'ekar!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MINYAN HA'RA'UY EXEMPTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Minyan ha'Ra'uy exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If one of the counted animals re-entered the pen, they are all exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The counted animals were exempt through Minyan ha'Ra'uy!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps they are exempt because Ma'aser was taken! (However, if all 10 did not leave, they are not exempt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This cannot be, for the Seifa discusses that!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If one of the tithed animals re-entered the pen...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps the Seifa means that the Asiri re-entered the pen!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> It says that each is Ro'eh, and the owner eats it when it gets a Mum. Surely, the Asiri entered the pen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "Ya'avor" excludes an animal that already left before.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of 'that already left before'?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it was part of 10 that left and Ma'aser was taken, we do not need a verse for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was exempted through Minyan ha'Ra'uy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven had 10 lambs and brought them into a pen, and counted five and one died:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one of the counted ones died, he completes the count for Ma'aser (as if all were alive);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one of the remaining ones died, the counted ones are exempt (due to Minyan ha'Ra'uy). The remaining ones will join for Ma'aser in the next Goren.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven had 14 lambs, and brought them into a pen with two openings:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If six left from opening 1 and then four left from opening 2, and four remained;:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the last four leave from opening 1, the last is Ma'aser. The four that left from opening 2 will join (for Ma'aser) in the next Goren.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If not (they leave from opening 2 or remain in the pen), the six are exempt (Minyan ha'Ra'uy), and the other eight join in the next Goren.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If four left from opening 1 and then six left from opening 2, and four remained;:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the last four leave from opening 2, the last is Ma'aser. The four that left from 1 are (also) exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If not, the first 10 that left are exempt, and the last four join in the next Goren.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If four left from opening 1 and then four left from opening 2, and six remained;:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the last six all leave from opening 1 or all from 2, the last is Ma'aser, and (also) the four that left from the other opening are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If not (they leave from a third opening or remain in the pen), the first eight are exempt, and the six join in the next Goren.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, the Chidush is that Minyan ha'Ra'uy exempts. Rava already taught this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that only a definite Minyan ha'Ra'uy (when there is only one opening, we expect all 10 to leave through it) exempts, but not a Safek Minyan ha'Ra'uy. Rava teaches that this is not so. (Alternatively - it is called Safek Minyan ha'Ra'uy when the same set of animals remaining in the pen exempts two sets of animals that left through different openings.)</p>
