<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Ploni received wages for ruling about a (Mum of a) Bechor, one may not rely on his ruling to slaughter it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The only exception is an expert like Ila of Yavneh. Chachamim permitted him to receive four Isarim (an Isar is eight Perutos) for checking a small animal, and six Isarim for a large animal, whether he ruled that it is Tam or Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why did he receive more for a large animal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more work to check its Mum (he must throw the animal to the ground and tie it up).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>(Mishnah):... Whether he ruled that it is Tam or Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, he is paid for ruling that it is a Ba'al Mum. This permits it to be slaughtered;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why is he paid for ruling that it is Tam?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he were paid only for ruling that it is a Ba'al Mum, people would suspect that he does so even when it is really Tam, for his own profit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Now that he is paid either way, people might suspect that he forbids Ba'alei Mum (i.e. says that it is not a Mum) in order to profit, for the owner will bring it to him again after another Mum develops!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim enacted that he is paid only once for any one animal (even if he checks it many times before permitting it).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TAKING WAGES FOR <i>MITZVOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was paid for any of the following Mitzvos, the Mitzvah is invalid:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To judge, to testify, to sprinkle Mei Chatas, or to be Mekadesh (to mix the ashes with the water);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The following compensation may be given;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Kohen became Tamei (in order to do a Mitzvah), one may give him Chulin to eat, drink and anoint with, for now he may not consume Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may supply a donkey for an elder (who has difficulty walking) to ride on;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If a worker was idle from his job, one may pay him like a worker (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source (to forbid wages for giving rulings, i.e. teaching Torah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "Re'eh Limadti Eschem... " - just like Moshe was not paid for teaching Torah, we should not be paid for it. (Rashi (Kidushin 58b) - one may not be paid for any Mitzvah that is not an exertion, for the wages are for having learned how to do the Mitzvah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "... Ka'sher Tzivani Hash-m Elokai" (the end of the above verse) - just like Moshe taught Torah for free, we should do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if one cannot find a Rebbi to teach him for free, he should pay to learn?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Emes Keneh."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one should not say "just like I had to pay to learn Torah, I will charge to teach"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Emes Keneh v'Al Timkor."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was paid to sprinkle or to be Mekadesh the water, the water and ashes are not Metaher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If one was Mekadesh a woman with the water or ashes (of Parah Adumah), she is Mekudeshes, even if he is a Yisrael. (Kidushin requires something worth money. This shows that one may charge for them!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> One may not be paid to sprinkle or to be Mekadesh. (If he was, this disqualifies the water and ashes);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may be paid for (and therefore make Kedushin with the act of) transporting ashes or filling up the Kli with water. (Rashi - this act is not the Mitzvah itself.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Our Mishnah disqualified one who was paid <i>to sprinkle or to be Mekadesh</i>. The Beraisa discusses Kedushin using the water and ashes themselves (Rambam; Rashi - the act of transporting them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen became Tamei, disqualifying him from Terumah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Kohen is forbidden to become Tamei (for these Mitzvos. He is permitted only for  deceased relative or a Mes Mitzvah, i.e. a body that no one is is around to bury it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Kohen passed through a Beis ha'Peras (a field in which a corpse was plowed. We are concerned lest the plow dragged bones.) Its Tum'ah is only mid'Rabanan. (We are concerned lest one who walks through touch or move a bone k'Se'orah (the size of a barley seed)):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may walk through a Beis ha'Peras if he bendsng down and blows the earth (to clear away any small bones he might encounter) before each step. (If Tum'as Beis ha'Peras were mid'Oraisa, Chachamim would not allow this leniency, nor the next, for something that was definitely forbidden is not permitted due to a Safek, i..e perhaps the Tum'ah was removed.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah bar Ami):</span> If many people have walked through a Beis ha'Peras, it is Tahor. (We assume that any small bones have been crushed to less than k'Se'orah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Kohen became Tamei through a Tum'ah that is not forbidden to him (any Tum'ah other than Mes. Some permit some kinds of Tum'as Mes to him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may supply a donkey for an elder to ride on. (If a worker was idle from his job, one may pay him like a worker.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One pays a worker the amount of compensation he would want to be idle from his job (for the time he engaged in the Mitzvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We account for the exertion of his job. (One who engages in light work would want almost his full wage to be idle (Tosfos; Rashi - to do the Mitzvah instead). One who engages in rigorous work would accept a small portion of his wages to be idle.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO IS SUSPECTED ABOUT <i>BECHOROS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven is suspected to make a Mum in Bechoros (alternatively - treat Tam Bechoros like Chulin), one may not buy from him (what he says is) deer meat (for it looks like calf meat) nor untanned skins;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer permits buying skins of female animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may not buy from him cleaned or dirty wool. One may buy spun thread or garments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> One may not buy deer meat because it looks like and can be confused with calf meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One may not buy untanned skins, but tanned skins are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it really was a Bechor, Reuven would not bother (Rashi; Rambam - keep it long enough) to tan it, lest Chachamim find out and forbid it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> It is permitted to buy skins of female animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is evident (from the genital area) that it is a female, so Bechorah does not apply to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana disagrees. One could cut out the male genitals, and say that (it is a female, and that) mice nibbled there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer holds that one would be able to tell that it was not mice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not buy cleaned or dirty wool.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one may not buy cleaned wool (even though he put effort into it), there is no need to forbid buying dirty wool!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, one may not buy wool cleaned from its dirt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may buy spun thread or garments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Garments are already included in the Heter to buy spun thread!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah permits felt garments. (They are not made from thread.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>BUYING FROM ONE WHO IS SUSPECTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven is suspected about Shemitah (to plant, or do business with Shemitah produce), one may not buy from him flax, even if it was combed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may buy spun thread or Arig (woven material).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Arig is already included in the Heter to buy spun thread!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah permits chains made from unspun flax.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If Reuven is suspected to sell Terumah and say that it is Chulin, one may not buy from him even water or salt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Shimon forbids (only) anything to which Terumah applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does "anything" come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes fish innards, for often olive oil is added.</p>
