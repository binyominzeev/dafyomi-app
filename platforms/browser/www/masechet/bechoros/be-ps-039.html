<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much (of the dry or moist fodder) must the animal eat?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It must eat the volume of a dry fig.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rava):</span> Does he mean, it must eat the volume of a dry fig at its first meal (feeding) every day, or at every meal?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If you will say that it must eat at its first meal, must it eat (the dry or moist fodder) before or after its meal?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely, eating it before helps, just like medicine (for people) is generally taken before a meal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We ask whether also eating after helps.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must it eat (the dry or moist fodder) before or after drinking?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely, eating it before helps, just like animals normally eat barley before drinking;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We ask whether eating after also helps. (The cure works better if the animal is happy. The next question are about things that could sadden it and disqualify the cure.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must it eat when it is tied up or loose?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely, eating when untied helps. We ask whether also eating when tied helps.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must it eat when alone or among other animals?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely, eating with others helps. We ask whether also eating alone helps.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Must it eat in the city or in the field?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely, eating in the field helps. We ask whether also eating in the city helps.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> If you will say that it must eat in the field, is a garden close to the city considered like a field?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>These questions are not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Chanina ben Antigonus):</span> We check it three times within 80 days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The three times must be evenly spaced (Rashi - at 26, 53 and 80 days; Tosfos - at the beginning, 40, and 80 days).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Pinchas, Shmuel's brother):</span> If the water was not cured, was it retroactively a Mum (from when it was observed), or only now that it is established?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(If one redeemed the animal in the interim,) the answer to this determines whether or not one who benefitted from the Pidyon (redemption money) transgressed Me'ilah:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it is a Mum retroactively, it was a proper Pidyon, he transgressed Me'ilah. If it is a Mum only now, the Pidyon did not take effect yet, so he was not Mo'el.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> You are not a Chacham, but you asked a superb question! (I cannot answer it.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>FACIAL MUMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Mumim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The nose or lip was punctured, Chaser or cracked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If the wall between the nostrils was punctured externally (at the bottom, where it is visible) it is a Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was punctured internally, it is not a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The lip was punctured, Chaser or cracked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This refers to the outer edge of the lip. These are not Mumim in the width.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the outer Chutin (Rashi - gums; R. Gershom - teeth) are chipped or cracked, or if the inner Chutin are uprooted (it is a Mum).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Chanina ben Antigonus says, we do not check from the Tiyumes (molars, which look like double teeth) and inwards, nor the Tiyumes itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the Tiyumes?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the Tiyumes and inwards, and the Tiyumes itself is considered inside (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Kefutzai says, we slaughter only due to outer Chutin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Chanina ben Antigonus says, we do not pay any attention to the Tiyumes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> What does this mean? (The Beraisa did not explain what the Tiyomes is!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> The first Tana and R. Yehoshua do not argue!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated. It means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered inner (Chutin)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the Tiyumes and inwards is inner. The Tiyumes itself is considered inside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One may not slaughter (outside the Mikdash) due to inner Chutin if they were Chaserim or cracked, but if they were uprooted, one may slaughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Kefutzai says, we slaughter (outside) only due to outer Chutin;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If inner Chutin were uprooted, one may not slaughter (outside), but this disqualifies from Hakravah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Chanina ben Antigonus says, we do not pay any attention to the Tiyumes, even to disqualify.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>INTERNAL CHISARON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achdevoy bar Ami):</span> Are we concerned about Mechusar Ever Bifnim (if an internal organ is missing)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he ask about?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>(He cannot ask whether it is Posel a Bechor, because) only external Mumim are Posel a Bechor. It says "Pise'ach Oh Iver."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>(He cannot ask whether it is Posel Kodshim, because) only external Mumim are Posel other Kodshim. It says "Averes Oh Shavur"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Granted, Mechusar Ever Bifnim is not a full-fledged Mum to permit Shechitah (outside) or redemption, but perhaps it is Posel (a Bechor and Kodshim);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Perhaps "Tamim Yihyeh l'Ratzon" this disqualifies even internal Chisaron;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, perhaps the end of the verse, "... Mum Lo Yihyeh Bo" teaches about the beginning. Just like a Mum is external, also Tamim is required only externally!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Tana'im argue about this:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "V'Es Shtei ha'Kelayos" excludes an animal with three kidneys, or only one;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> "Yesirenah" (singular) is Machshir for the Mizbe'ach an animal with only one kidney.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We are thinking that all agree that an animal is not born with only one kidney, and one of the kidneys is missing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #1:</span> Tana #1 considers an internal Chisaron like (an external) Chisaron (it is Posel), and Tana #2 does not consider it a Chisaron (it is Kosher).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chiya bar Yosef):</span> No, all agree that an animal can be born with only one kidney, and an internal Chisaron is a Chisaron;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #2 (Rav Chiya bar Yosef):</span> Beraisa #1 discusses an animal born with two kidneys (one is missing), and Beraisa #2 discusses an animal born with one kidney.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Beraisa #1 also discusses an animal with three kidneys. Surely it was born with three! Surely, also the case of one kidney is when it was born with one!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #3:</span> They argue about whether an animal can be born with only one kidney. Tana #1 holds that it cannot, Tana #2 holds that it can.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>(Rashi - the Objection assumes that it can be born with one, therefore it is more reasonable to make the cases similar, even if we cannot explain why it is Pasul when it was born with one. if Tana #1 holds that it cannot be born with only one, we are forced to say that the cases of one and three kidneys are dissimilar.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #4 (R. Yochanan):</span> All agree that an animal cannot be born with only one kidney, and that an internal Chisaron is not a Chisaron;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Beraisa #1 is Posel when a kidney was lost before Shechitah. Beraisa #2 is Machshir when it was lost after Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even if it was lost after Shechitah, Chisaron before Kabalah is Posel!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> If one nicked the ear of a Korban before Kabalah, it is Pasul. "V'Lakach... mi'Dam <i>ha'Par</i>" teaches that the bull must be intact.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Beraisa #1 is Posel when it was lost before Kabalah, and Beraisa #2 is Machshir when it was lost after Kabalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even if it was lost after Kabalah, Chisaron before Zerikah is Posel!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Seh Samim Zachar Ben Shanah Yihyeh" - it must be Tam and yearling (within its first year) at the time of Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that it must be so at the time of the other Avodos?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yihyeh" - all its Avodos must be when it is Tam and yearling. (Griz - the Rambam understands "Tam" here to mean "complete.")</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that "Yihyeh" requires only it to be yearling during the Avodos (but it need not be Tam).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> If a k'Zayis of the meat or Chelev of a Korban remains, we may do Zerikah (throw the blood on the Mizbe'ach. If only a k'Zayis remains, this is the ultimate Mum!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it was yearling at the time of Shechitah, surely it is yearling at the time of Zerikah (it must be the same day)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> This teaches that we calculate the age of Korbanos from hour to hour. (The case is, its first year finished between Shechitah and Zerikah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Tana'im argue about whether an internal Chisaron is a Chisaron:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "U'Ma'uch v'Chasus v'Nasuk v'Charus" all apply to the Beitzim (testicles).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> All the more so, they should apply to the Ever (it is more exposed than the Beitzim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Yehudah says that all apply <i>even</i> to the Beitzim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, all apply (only) to the Ever;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Yosi says, Ma'uch and Kasus apply even to the Beitzim. Nasuk and Karus apply to the Ever.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yehudah holds that an internal Chisaron is a Chisaron, and R. Eliezer ben Yakov holds that it is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If this is the only consideration, we cannot explain R. Yosi!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he holds that an internal Chisaron is a Chisaron, all of these Mumim should apply even to the Beitzim. If it is not a Chisaron, none of them should apply to the Beitzim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they argue about whether a Mum in the Beitzim is considered exposed:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that Ma'uch and Kasus are exposed, because they cause the Beitzim to shrivel up. Nasuk and Karus are exposed, because they cause the Beitzim to hang lower in the sac;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer holds that Ma'uch and Kasus are not exposed, because sometimes healthy Beitzim shrivel up. Nasuk and Karus are not exposed, because sometimes healthy Beitzim hang low in the sac;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yosi says that Ma'uch and Kasus are Mumim, because the Beitzim are missing (R. Gershom - dissolved). Nasuk and Karus are not Mumim, because the Beitzim are intact.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MUMIM OF THE ERVAH AND TAIL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Mumim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The sac containing the Beitzim or the Eryah (area around the female genitals - this applies to Kodshim that can be females, not to Bechor) is Chaser;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>There is a Chisaron in the bone of the tail, but not if the Chisaron is in the joint;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> A bone of the tail is exposed (the skin and meat came off).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> The end of the tail splits into two bones. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>There is k'Etzba (a finger's width) of flesh between vertebrae (in the tail).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Elazar):</span> It is a Mum only if the sac is Chaser, but not if it is removed (for then it can grow back). It is a Mum in the sac, but not in the Ever (for it can heal);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> It is a Mum only if the sac is Chaser, but not if it is removed. It is a Mum in the sac, but not in the Ever;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yosi ben ha'Meshulam says, a case occurred in which a wolf took the entire sac, and it grew back.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There is a Chisaron in the bone of the tail (... there is k'Etzba of flesh between vertebrae).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The finger to which the Chachamim refer is a (thumb, a) quarter of a Tefach. (There was no tradition that this Beraisa explains our Mishnah. Perhaps it refers to a different Halachah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which Halachah does this refer? (The Griz asks, according to the Rambam, who says that whenever a Stam finger is mentioned, it is a quarter Tefach. If so, what was the question? The Netziv answers that we asked where the Mishnah discusses such a finger. However, Rabah answered from a Beraisa!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> It refers to Tzitzis:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> How many strings are required?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beis Shamai):</span> Four strings are required. (They are put through the corner and doubled over, making eight ends);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beis Hillel):</span> Three strings are required (six ends).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long should be Meshuleshes? (This is what hangs below the corner.
