<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Pesulim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One whose ankles or knees knock when he walks;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Ikal, i.e. one whose knees do not touch when he sits with his feet together;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Ba'al Pikah (Rashi - flesh like a ball protrudes from his thumb or big toe; Rambam - the next Mum (a big heel) is Ba'al Pikah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>His heel sticks out in back (of where his foot connects to his leg);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>His feet are wide like a goose's;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>His fingers or toes overlap each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If his fingers or toes are connected until the (middle) joint, he is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they were connected past the joint, and they were cut apart, he is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he had an extra finger or toe and it was cut off, if it had a bone, he is Pasul. If not, he is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if he has six fingers on every hand and foot, 24 in all, he is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Chachamim are Posel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rebbi is Posel one who is ambidextrous;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Chachamim are Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Question:</span> "Shever Ragel" only teaches about a broken leg. What is the source to Posel one who is knock-kneed, Ikal, and Ba'al Pikah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Oh Shever Ragel" includes these.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Ba'al Pikah and Shufnar are Pesulim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Ba'al Pikah is one whose ankle is big. Shufnar does not have ankles (that stick out) at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Flesh like a ball protrudes from his thumb or big toe. His heel sticks out in back.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> (In the latter,) his leg connects to the middle of his foot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> His feet are wide like a goose's.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> We do not require that they are thin <i>and</i> the toes are stuck together. Rather, if they are thin, even if the toes are apart, it is a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> His fingers or toes overlap each other; or, if his fingers or toes are connected...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "Shever Yad" teaches only about a broken hand;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is the source to Posel one whose fingers overlap each other; or, if his fingers are connected past the joint, and they were cut apart...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> The Mishnah is Machshir if they were cut apart!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> What is the source to Posel... if they were not cut apart?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Oh Shever Yad" includes these.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>AN EXTRA FINGER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he had an extra finger or toe and it was cut off, if it had a bone, he is Pasul. If not, he is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is only if it is counted on the hand (i.e. it is in line with the other fingers. If not, he is Kosher in any case.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>(Even a small bone of a Mes has Tum'as Maga (touching) and Masa (moving); Tum'as Ohel applies only to a complete Ever (with flesh and sinews), or a Rova Kav (Log) of bones, or bones that comprise the majority of the height, or are the majority of bones of the body (i.e. at least 125).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If an extra finger has a bone but not a nail, it has Tum'as Maga, Masa and Ohel, and it counts towards 125 bones.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is only if it is counted on the hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda citing Rav):</span> If an extra finger has a bone but not a nail, it has Tum'as Maga and Masa, but not Ohel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is only if it is not counted on the hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> This is difficult. Chachamim did not explain it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is an Ever, it should be Metamei also b'Ohel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is not an Ever, it should not have Tum'as Masa or Maga!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna bar Mano'ach):</span> (It is not an Ever.) It is like a bone no smaller than a barley seed. It has Tum'as Maga and Masa, but not Ohel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> (Mid'Oraisa, it is not an Ever, and it does not have Tum'as Mes.) Chachamim decreed that it has Tum'as Maga and Masa, lest people think that even if it is counted on the hand it is not Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> For the same reason, they should have decreed Tum'as Ohel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They made it unlike Tum'ah mid'Oraisa in this respect, in order that people will know that its Tum'ah is only mid'Rabanan, lest they burn Terumah or Kodshim due to it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE NUMBER OF LIMBS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Bones that comprise the majority of the height (without the head; this will be explained), or are the majority of bones of the body have Tum'as Ohel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the majority of the height?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is both shins and one thigh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The majority of bones is 125.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Does the Tana merely teach that 125 is the majority (of the 248 limbs)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He teaches like the following Beraisa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even if the person was missing limbs and had only 200.(e.g. he lacked eight fingers and toes, each of which has six bones) or had extra, e.g. a total of 281, even the extra limbs count towards 125;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We consider 125 to be the majority, like it is for most people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A case occurred in which the king sentenced a harlot to be burned. She was cooked in water. R. Yishmael's Talmidim counted the bones.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> We found 252 bones in a Mes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Perhaps it was a female. Verses teach that she has four extra limbs, i.e. two hinges and two doors.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A woman has hinges, just like a house - "... Ki Nehefchu Aleha Tzireha."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says a woman has doors, just like a house - "Ki Lo Sagar Dalsei Vitni."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Akiva says a woman has a key, just like a house - "va'Yiftach Es Rachmah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Akiva, they should have found 253!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The key is very small. Perhaps it dissolved in cooking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The extra limbs of a woman are not Metamei b'Ohel. "Adam Ki Yamus b'Ohel" teaches that Tum'as Ohel applies only to limbs found in all people (but not those special to females).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Verses teach that men also have hinges. Yeshayahu said "Tzirim Achazuni k'Tzirei Yoledah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A man's hinges are of flesh, not of bone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Daniel said that "Adoni ba'Mar'a Nehefchu Tzirai Alai"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A man's hinges are of flesh, not bone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> We must say so. If not, neither men nor women would have (exactly) 248 limbs!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he has six fingers on every hand and foot... (R. Yehudah is Machshir, and Chachamim are Posel.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Both of them expound the same verse. Regarding Galyus it says "v'Etzbe'os Yadav v'Etzbe'os Raglav Shesh va'Shesh";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim hold that the verse disgraces him (he was a Ba'al Mum);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that the verse magnifies his might.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> Why does it say "Shesh va'Shesh Esrim v'Arba Mispar"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said only Shesh va'Shesh, we would have thought that he had a total of six fingers and a total of six toes. Therefore, it says Esrim v'Arba (24);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it said only Esrim v'Arba, we would not know that each hand had the same number of fingers;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Mispar" teaches that they were counted with the hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A case occurred in which a man came in front of R. Tarfon. He had six digits on every hand and foot. R. Tarfon said "there should be more like you in Yisrael!"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> (This was not a praise. He meant that the Mamzerim and Nesinim in Yisrael should stand out like you (lest people marry them)!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PESULIM THAT APPLY ONLY TO PEOPLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who is ambidextrous...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen is left handed or favors his left foot (begins walking with it), he is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi is Posel an ambidextrous Kohen;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim are Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rebbi holds that his right hand is weaker than it should be. Chachamim hold that his right hand is fine, and his left hand is extra strong.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Pesulim in a person, but not in an animal:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Kushi, Gichor, or Lavkan (these will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One who is a Kipe'ach, midget, deaf, crazy, drunk, or has Nega'im (resembling Tzara'as) that are Tehorim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, a crazy animal is not a choice Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Elazar says, also dangling flesh is Posel a person, but not an animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> A Kushi is black. A Gichor is (very) white (Albino). A Lavkan is red.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A man was saying "who wants Luvkiani," and he was found to be selling white (sheep)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, a Kushi is black, a Gichor is red, and a Lavkan is white.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Kipe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Zevid - Beraisa):</span> This is a (very) tall person.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Avahu taught that Hash-m praises tall people - "v'Anochi Hishmadeti Es ha'Emori Mipneihem Asher k'Govah Arazim Gavho"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> One who is too thin for his height is scorned. (He does not stand straight, for he cannot support his weight.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> A (very) tall person should not marry another tall person, lest the children will be giants;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A midget should not marry another midget, lest the children be even smaller;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>An Albino should not marry another Albino, lest the children be too white;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A black person should not marry another black person, lest the children be very black.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who is deaf, crazy, or drunk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One who is drunk is Mechalel Avodah (what he offered is Pasul). He should be listed among Pesulim that are Mechalel Avodah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses someone drunk from things other than wine. It is unlike R. Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one ate a date of Ke'ilah, drank much milk, or ate much honey (cooked with water) and (became drunk and) entered the Mikdash, he is liable. (We know that this Beraisa is like R. Yehudah.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THINGS THAT DISQUALIFY ONLY ANIMALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Pesulim in an animal, but not in a person:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Oso v'Es Beno, Terefah, and Yotzei Dofen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a Kohen married a woman forbidden to him, he is Pasul until he vows not to benefit from her (Rashi - nor she from him);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If a Kohen becomes Tamei Mes, he is Pasul until he accedes not to do so again.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Oso v'Es Beno is not Pasul in a person. What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Aharon (or any other Kohen) and his children may serve together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The corresponding case of animals is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Oso v'Es Beno applies to a mother (and her child), but not to a father.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We may not offer a mother and her child on the same day, the corresponding case of Kohanim (a Kohenes and her son) may serve together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Kohenes may not do Avodah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1:</span> Really, the Mishnah permits a Kohen and his son;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Avin):</span> Our Mishnah is like Chananya.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Oso v'Es Beno applies to a mother, not to a father;</p></div>
