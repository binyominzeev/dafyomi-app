<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN A BAS KOHEN IS BURNED (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa) Question:</span> This is only if she married a Kohen (this will be explained). What is the source even if she married a Levi, Yisrael, Nochri, Chalal (one born from Isurei Kehunah) , Mamzer (one born from a Bi'ah of Kares), or Nesin (one of the seven Kena'ani nations)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'U'Vas Ish Kohen" includes even if she is not a Kohenes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Hi" - she is burned, but not the adulterer, and not Zomemim witnesses who testified about her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer says, "Es Aviha" is burned, but her father-in- law is stoned (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could the Beraisa suggest that she is burned for Chilul Shabbos? One is stoned for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Beraisa is R. Shimon, who says that burning is more severe than stoning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah is stringent about Kohanim. They have extra Mitzvos. One might have thought that a Bas Kohen gets a harsher Misah for Chilul Shabbos than a Yisrael does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would she be punished more severely than her father?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Male Kohanim may be Mechalel Shabbos to do Avodah, so the Torah is not extra stringent if they Mechalel Shabbos without permission;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah teaches that we are not more stringent for a Bas Kohen, even though she is never permitted to Mechalel Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could the Beraisa suggest that even a single girl is burned? It says "Liznos"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana holds like R. Eliezer, who says that if two singles have Bi'ah without intent for Kidushin, she becomes a Zonah (and is forbidden to Kohanim, i.e. this is called Zenus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa suggested that perhaps "Aviha" teaches that she is burned only if she was Mezanah with her father. Even a Bas Yisrael is burned for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We learn from Gezeros Shavos "Henah-Henah" and "Zimah-Zimah" (that a man is burned for Bi'ah with his daughter).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Torah taught that a Bas Kohen is burned, and we infer that a Bas Yisrael is not burned, i.e. we do not learn from the Gezeros Shavos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> This is only if she married a Kohen. What is the source for a Bas Kohen who married a Levi, Yisrael, Nochri, Chalal, Mamzer, or Nesin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'U'Vas Ish Kohen" includes even if she is not a Kohenes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If a Bas Kohen married one of these people, does she cease to be a Kohenes?! (Why would we think that she is not burned?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> What suggests that the verse discusses when she married a Kohen?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that "Ki <i>Sechel</i> Liznos" refers to when the Zenus profaned her, but if she was already profaned, she is not burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"U'Vas" teaches that once she had Bi'ah with someone forbidden to her, she is disqualified (permanently from marrying a Kohen or eating Terumah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even when she was married to a Levi or Yisrael, "v'Shavah" (after she is widowed or divorced, she resumes to eat Terumah)" implies that during the marriage, she was forbidden to eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Therefore, one might have thought that (she is not considered a Kohenes, and she) is not burned for Zenus. The Tana teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>This is not like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a Bas Kohen was married to a Levi or Yisrael, and she ate Terumah, she pays its value, but does not add a fifth. She is burned (for Zenus):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she was married to someone forbidden, she pays its value and adds a fifth (like a non-Kohen), and she is not burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, in both cases she does not add a fifth, and she is burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Eliezer says, "Es Aviha" she is burned. 'Es Chameha (her father-in-law)', she is stoned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>R. ELIEZER'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Eliezer mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> She is burned for Bi'ah with her father, and she is stoned for Bi'ah with her father-in-law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That applies even to a Bas Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, if she was (an Arusah, who lives) with her father, she is burned (for Zenus). If she was with her father-in-law (Nesu'ah), she is stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is unlike Chachamim. They say that an Arusah (Bas Kohen) is stoned, and not burned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is unlike R. Shimon. He says that also a Nesu'ah is burned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It is unlike R. Yishmael. He says that only an Arusah is burned, but not a Nesu'ah. A Nesu'ah is choked!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravin):</span> Really, it is like Chachamim. It means, any Zenus (i.e. of a Nesu'ah) for which a Bas Yisrael is killed less severely (choking) than for Zenus with her father (burning), a Bas Kohen is burned for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Any Zenus (i.e. of an Arusah) for which a Bas Yisrael is killed more severely (stoning) than for Zenus with her father (burning), a Bas Kohen is killed like one who was Mezanah with her father-in- law (stoning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The Mishnah does not discuss more or less severe Misos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Really, it is like R. Yishmael;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">51b----------------------------------------51b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she was Mezanah while with her father (Mekudeshes) she is burned. If she was (Nesu'ah and was) Mezanah <i>with</i> her father-in-law, she is stoned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she was Mezanah with anyone else, she is choked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> The Mishnah says 'Es Aviha... Es Chameha' - either both refer to the adulterer, or both refer to location!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Really, it is like R. Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon equates a Nesu'ah to an Arusah. Just like the Misah of an Arusah Bas Kohen (burning) is one level greater than that of a Bas Yisrael (stoning), also the Misah of a Nesu'ah Bas Kohen is  (stoning,) one level greater than that (choking) of a Bas Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Chanina):</span> R. Shimon explicitly said that a Bas Kohen is burned, whether she is Arusah or Nesu'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Ravina):</span> Really, it is like Chachamim. We must switch the laws. "Es Aviha" (when she is with her father, i.e. Arusah) she is <i>stoned</i>. When she is 'Es Chameha', she is <i>burned</i>;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> The Tana did not directly say 'Arusah' or 'Nesu'ah', for he uses the expressions of the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> The Tana taught it reversed because this is the law of Zenus <i>with</i> them (burning for the father, stoning for the father-in- law).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows Ravin's explanation of the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> This (law of Misas Beis Din) has no bearing until Moshi'ach will come (and the Sanhedrin will be restored. People will not sin then!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Also Korbanos will not apply until Moshi'ach comes. Should we not learn this now?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we study it and receive reward. Likewise, Rav Nachman teaches a Halachah about Misas Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I asked why Rav Nachman said that the Halachah follows Ravin. Ravina does not argue with him about Halachah, just about how to explain the wording of the Mishnah. (In any case it will not apply until Mashi'ach, and then will be Techiyas ha'Mesim, and R. Eliezer will explain himself!)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>R. YISHMAEL'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yishmael's opinion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> 'U'Vas Ish Kohen..." discusses a Na'arah Me'orasah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it also discusses a Nesu'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Mos Yumas ha'Noef veha'No'afes" refers to all adulterers (and Mos Yumas connotes choking);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Torah taught two exceptions. An Arusah Bas Yisrael is stoned, and a Bas Kohen is burned;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The exception of stoning applies only to an Arusah Bas Yisrael, but not to a Nesu'ah. Likewise, the exception of burning applies only to an Arusah Bas Kohen, but not to a Nesu'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Ka'asher Zomam" teaches about Zomemeha (lying witnesses who testified about a Bas Kohen) and the adulterer...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> How does this teach about the adulterer?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> It means, her Zomemim receive the Misah of the adulterer - "Ka'asher Zomam La'asos <i>l'Achiv</i>", and not as he plotted to do to his 'sister' (i.e. the Bas Kohen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says, the Torah teaches that a Bas Kohen is burned, whether she is Arusah or Nesu'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps she is burned even if she is single!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says here "Aviha", like it says about a Na'arah Me'orasah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like there she has a husband, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> If it must be like it says there, it should only apply to a Na'arah Me'orasah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> I expound the extra 'Vov' to include a Nesu'ah - "<i>u</i>'Vas Kohen."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Is this a reason to burn? If the verse includes a Nesu'ah, you should also include a single girl. If it excludes a single girl, you should also exclude a Nesu'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> The Gezerah Shavah excludes a single girl. "U'Vas" includes a Nesu'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>R. Yishmael thought that when R. Akiva said that he expounds the extra 'Vov', he retracted from the Gezerah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yishmael expound "U'Vas"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds like the father of Shmuel bar Avin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel bar Avin's father):</span> Regarding males, the Torah gave different laws for blemished and unblemished Kohanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we also distinguish among females (a blemished Bas Kohen is like a Bas Yisrael, and she is not burned)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "<i>U</i>'Vas" (includes even a blemished Bas Kohen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Akiva knows not to distinguish from "Hem Makrivim v'Hayu Kodesh" (blemished Kohanim are disqualified only for Avodah, but they have Kedushas Kehunah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael holds that one might have thought that this is only for males, but a blemished Bas Kohen has no Kedushah.</p>
