<p class="dedicationbox">SANHEDRIN 47 (10 Elul) - This Daf has been dedicated in memory of Sheina Basha (daughter of Yakov and Dora) Zuckerman, who passed away on 10 Elul, by her children and sons in law. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE REASON FOR EULOGIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Beraisa):</span> "Nivzeh b'Einav Nim'as" refers to Chizkiyah, who dragged his father's bones on a bed of ropes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If (eulogies or other honor shown to the dead) were to honor the living, he would not have done so (to disgrace the living)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He did so in order that the disgrace would atone for his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is to honor the living, he should not have delayed the honor of Yisrael (the eulogy) for the sake of his father!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yisrael pardoned their honor to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6:</span> Before Rebbi died, he instructed 'do not eulogize me in cities.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is to honor the living, what difference does it make to him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He wanted Yisrael to get more honor through himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #7 (Mishnah):</span> If he left him for his honor, to bring a coffin or shrouds, he does not transgress.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> it means, for the deceased's honor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it means for the honor of the living.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we leave the deceased overnight in order to honor the living?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! The Isur "Lo Salin" resembles leaving a person hanging, which is a disgrace. Here, it is not a disgrace.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #8 (Beraisa):</span> If he left him for his honor, for eulogizers to gather in cities, to bring women to wail over him, to bring a coffin or shrouds, he does not transgress, for these are purely to honor the deceased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It means, whatever is purely to honor the living, this is not a disgrace to the deceased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #9 (Beraisa - R. Noson):</span> It is a good sign for the deceased if he is punished in this world, e.g. if he was not eulogized, was not buried, was dragged around by an animal, or it was raining on him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since it is an atonement if he was not eulogized, this shows that the eulogy is to honor the deceased.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BURIAL OF SOMEONE EXECUTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Someone executed is not buried with his family.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not bury a Rasha next to a Tzadik.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Acha bar Chanina):</span> We learn from "va'Yashilchu Es ha'Ish b'Kever Elisha va'Yiga ha'Ish b'Atzmos Elisha va'Ychi va'Yakam Al Raglav." (A Rasha was buried in Elisha's grave. The man revived and walked out.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> You assume that he was revived because a Rasha may not be buried near a Tzadik;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Perhaps he was revived to fulfill "vi'Hi Na Pi Shnayim b'Ruchacha Alai"! (Elisha requested  to have twice the  Ru'ach ha'Kodesh that Eliyahu had, and Eliyahu agreed. Eliyahu revived one Mes, and this was Elisha's second.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha):</span> If so, he should have lived longer;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He stood on his legs, but he did not even reach his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, when did Elisha revive another person, to fulfill Eliyahu's blessing?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He cured Na'aman's Tzara'as;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Metzorah is considered to be dead - "Al Na Sehi ka'Mes."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Similarly, we do not bury a severe Rasha near a less severe Rasha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beis Din should have four cemeteries, one for each death penalty!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A tradition from Moshe from Sinai teaches that Beis Din has two cemeteries.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS DEATH AN ATONEMENT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one (mistakenly) ate Chelev, was Makdish a Korban to atone for this, became a Mumar (idolator, who may not offer a Korban) and repented, since the animal was once Nidcheh (unable to be offered), it can never be offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one ate Chelev, was Makdish a Korban, went crazy and regained sanity, since the animal was once Nidcheh, it can never be offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He needed to teach both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he taught only the first case, one might have thought that there it can never be offered, because he actively was Docheh the Korban, but insanity happens by itself, so he is like one who goes to sleep (the Korban is not (permanently) Nidcheh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had he taught only the second case, one might have thought that there it can never be offered, because he cannot restore his sanity, but a Mumar can always repent (so his Korban is not Nidcheh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> If there were Kodshei Mizbe'ach in an Ir ha'Nidachas, we do not burn them with the rest of the city, we precipitate their death;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there were Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis, we redeem them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we kill Kodshei Mizbe'ach? Once the owners die, that is an atonement for them. The Korbanos (are no longer "Zevach Resha'im", so they) should be offered!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This is because once a Korban was Nidcheh, it is permanently Nidcheh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (and Answer #2 - Abaye):</span> No, death is not an atonement for one who died without Teshuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a Kohen becomes Tamei to bury a relative who separated from the ways of the Tzibur (e.g. a Mumar)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection: (Rav Shemaya):</span> He is Mitamei "b'Amav", only for one who acted like your people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (against Abaye - Rava):</span> There is a difference between one who died without Teshuvah and one who was executed without Teshuvah. Since the latter did not die naturally, his death atones for him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava, for himself) Question:</span> "...Nivlas <i>Avadecha</i>... Besar <i>Chasidecha</i>" - what do these refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Chasidecha" are the true Tzadikim. "Avadecha (Your servants)" are those who were Chayav Misah. Since they were killed, they are called "Your servants."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> Death at the hands of the king is different than execution by Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Those killed by the king were not killed according to law, therefore it atones for them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Those killed by Beis Din were killed according to law, therefore it does not atone for them (without Teshuvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye, for himself - Mishnah):</span> Someone executed is not buried with his family.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Misas Beis Din is an atonement, he should be buried with his family right away!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Death and the burial together bring atonement.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah - Mishnah):</span> The relatives do not mourn. They conduct Aninus, for this is not apparent to others.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If death and the burial bring atonement, they should mourn!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Decomposition of the flesh is also needed for atonement.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> After the flesh has decomposed, his bones are buried with his family.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Really, death and the burial bring atonement by themselves;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mourning should begin from Stimas ha'Golel (Rashi - sealing of the coffin; R. Tam - placing a stone to mark off the grave), atonement is only after suffering pain of burial;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since they were Nidchim (disqualified) from beginning mourning at the proper time, they are permanently Nidchim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why do we wait until the flesh decomposes before burying the bones with his family?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not feasible to collect the bones while the flesh is rotting.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>BENEFIT FROM GRAVES AND SHROUDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>People would take dirt from Rav's grave to cure a fever on the first day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> It is permitted. The ground does not become forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Yashlach Es Afarah (of the Asheirah) Al Kever Bnei ha'Am" equates a grave to idolatry:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Idolatry attached to the ground is permitted. The Torah forbids "Eloheihem Al he'Harim" (their gods <i>on</i> the mountains), but the mountains are not their gods;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Likewise, attached dirt of a grave is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one dug a grave for his father (or anyone else, after his death) and buried him elsewhere, no one else may be buried in the first grave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he made a tomb above ground (since it was originally detached, it becomes forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One may benefit from a new grave;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Nefel (stillborn baby) was put inside, one may not benefit from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, the tomb is above ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> There are three types of graves: a found grave, a known grave, and a grave that harms the public.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one finds a grave on his property that he did not authorize, he may move it. After he does so, its place is Tahor, and one may benefit from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may not move a known grave (the owner of the property authorized it). If he moved it, its place is Tamei and one may not benefit from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If a grave harms the public, one may move it. After he does so, its place is Tahor and one may not benefit from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, the tomb is above ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why may one move a found grave? Perhaps it was a Mes Mitzvah, which acquires (the right to remain in) its place!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Mes Mitzvah becomes known. (Since we did not hear about it, we are not concerned for this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If one wove a garment for a Mes, one may not benefit from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One may benefit from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye forbids, because designation takes effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava permits, because designation has no effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Abaye's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns a Gezerah Shavah "Sham-Sham" from Eglah Arufah. Just like the calf is forbidden through designation (being taken to the Nachal (valley or river)), also designation for a Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Rava learns the Gezerah Shavah "Sham-Sham" from idolatry. Just like (a Keli to serve) idolatry is not forbidden through designation (until he serves with it), also designation for a Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't Rava learn from Eglah Arufah?</p>
