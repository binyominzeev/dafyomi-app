<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HE MAY NOT MARRY TOO MANY WIVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> "V'Lo Yarbeh Lo Nashim" - a king may not marry more than 18 wives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, he may marry more, on condition that they not divert his heart (from fearing Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon says, he may not marry even one who will divert his heart;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Torah forbid taking <i>too many</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One may not take many even if they inspire him to fear Hash-m, like Avigayil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> In our Mishnah, R. Yehudah derives a Halachah from (what he understands to be) the reason for a Mitzvah, and R. Shimon does not. Elsewhere, they hold vice-versa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> One may not take a security from a widow, whether she is rich or poor - "v'Lo Sachabol Beged Almanah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, one may take from a rich widow, but not from a poor widow. You must return it, and you ruin her reputation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> <i>If</i> you would take from a poor widow, since you must return it every day, you would ruin her reputation (for people will see you by her every day).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> R. Shimon derives a Halachah from the reason for a Mitzvah, and R. Yehudah does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here (marrying too many wives) is different, for the Torah gave the reason - "v'Lo Yarbeh Lo Nashim (<i>in order that</i>) v'Lo Yasur Levavo" (therefore, R. Yehudah derives a Halachah from the reason);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> Had the Torah said only "v'Lo Yarbeh Lo Nashim", we would have known that this is lest they divert his heart;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah explicitly said "v'Lo Yasur Levavo" to forbid even one who would divert his heart.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why must the Torah forbid taking too many?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It forbids taking many, even like Avigayil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that only 18 are allowed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> David had (children from) six wives "Amnon la'Achino'am... veha'Shishi Yisre'am l'Eglah", and Noson ha'Navi told him "v'Osifah Lecha ka'Henah vecha'Henah" - another six and another six.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Ravina):</span> We should say that "ka'Henah" teaches (six more, and in all) 12, and "vecha'Henah" teaches (another 12, and in all) 24!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "V'Lo Yarbeh Lo Nashim" - a king may not marry more than 24 wives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>According to the opinion that expounds 'vov' ("<i>ve</i>cha'Henah"), he should be allowed 48!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "V'Lo Yarbeh Lo Nashim" - a king may not marry more than 48 wives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for the Tana of our Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> He equates the latter 'ka'Henah' to the former 'ka'Henah.' Just like the former teaches six more, also the latter.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DAVID'S WIVES AND CHILDREN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> David had a seventh wife, Michal, when Noson ha'Navi told him "ka'Henah vecha'Henah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Eglah is Michal. She is called Eglah because she was as dear to him as a calf (like Shimshon said) - "Lulei Charashtem b'Eglasi."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Eglah had a child, but Michal did not - "ul'Michal Bas Sha'ul Lo Hayah Lah Yeled Ad Yom Mosah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> She did not have a child <i>Ad</i> (before) the day she died. She bore a child the day she died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The verse listed David's children in Chevron. The episode with Michal was (later, in) Yerushalayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"U'Michal... va'Tere Es ha'Melech David Mefazez u'Mcharcher Lifnei Hash-m va'Tivez Lo b'Libah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> She was punished for this (by not having children).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, she did not have more children after this episode, she had children from before.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yikach David Od Pilagshim v'Nashim mi'Yrushalayim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He took more, until he had 18,</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between Pilagshim and Nashim (wives)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> Wives have a Kesuvah and Kidushin. Pilagshim do not have a Kesuvah, nor (our text; some texts - but have) Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> David had 400 children (perhaps this means 'descendants') from Yafos To'ar (attractive women taken in war);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They grew Bluris (long hair in back), and they sat in gold wagons at the head of the troops. They were the strong-arms of Beis David (to scare the enemy).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE EPISODE WITH TAMAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Tamar was the daughter of a Yafes To'ar (she was conceived before her mother converted) - "Daber Na El ha'Melech Lo Yimna'eni Mimeka";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had she been David's daughter from a Yisraelis, she would have been Amnon's sister!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Ul'Amnon Re'a... Chacham" - he was a Chacham for evil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Va'Tichak Es ha'Meshares va'Titzok Lefanav" - Tamar made fried food for Amnon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yisna'eha" - (after he raped her,) why did he hate her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> His Ever got caught on a hair, and it castrated him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> She did not intend for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> She intentionally tied a hair to castrate him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava taught that "va'Yetzei Lach Shem ba'Goyim b'Yafyech" - Benos Yisrael do not have hair in the underarms or near their Ervah! (Maharsha - they shave it; Maharshal - Hash-m causes that it does not grow.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tamar was the daughter of a Yafes To'ar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> "Va'Tichak Tamar Efer Al Roshah..." - this taught a great lesson to Benos Yisrael:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If such a great disgrace can occur even to the king's daughter, and all the more so to regular women. If it can occur even to modest women, and all the more so to immodest women!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> At that time, they decreed against seclusion (with a married woman) and Bi'ah with a single girl.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Seclusion is forbidden mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> "Ki Yesischa Achicha Ven Imecha" - do only maternal brothers entice, but not paternal brothers?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Rather, this hints that a man may be secluded with his mother, but not with other Arayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they decreed against seclusion with a single girl.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>"Va'Adoniyah... Misnasei Leimor Ani Emloch" - he tried on the crown that fits only those proper to be kings of Beis David, but it did not fit him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Ya'as... va'Chamishim Ish Ratzim Lefanav" - what was special about them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> He removed their spleens and the skin of the bottom of their feet (so they could run faster, and thorns would not hurt them).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HE MAY NOT ACQUIRE EXTRA HORSES OR MONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> "Lo Yarbeh Lo Susim" - only what he needs for his chariots (the army).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>"V'Chesef v'Zahav Lo Yarbeh Lo Me'od" - only what he needs to pay his army.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He writes a Sefer Torah for himself, and takes it to war. When he returns, he takes it. When he judges, it is with him  - "v'Haysah Imo v'Kara Bo Kol Yemei Chayav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> "Lo Yarbeh Lo Susim" - perhaps he may not have even for his chariots or cavalry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Lo Yarbeh <i>Lo</i>" - it is forbidden only if he increases to aggrandize himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which horses are forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Idle horses (that just run in front of him) are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that even one idle horse is forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Lema'an Harbos Sus."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "Susim" (plural)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that he transgresses a Lav for every idle horse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Had it not said "<i>Lo</i>", we would have said that he may not even have for his army (but a king needs these)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would have taught that he may have only a bare minimum for his army - "<i>Lo</i>" permits increasing these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> "V'Chesef v'Zahav Lo Yarbeh Lo Me'od" - only what he needs to pay his army.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "v'Chesef v'Zahav Lo Yarbeh Lo" forbids even what he needs to pay his army!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Lo Yarbeh <i>Lo</i>" - he does not increase for himself, but he may increase in order to pay his army.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Had it not said "<i>Lo</i>", we would have said that he may not even have for his army (but he needs an army)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would have taught that he may have only the minimum needed to pay an army - "<i>Lo</i>" permits extra (in case he will need to hire more soldiers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What will we expound from "Lo Yarbeh <i>Lo</i> Nashim"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This excludes commoners (they may marry many women).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>SHLOMO HAD TOO MANY HORSES, MONEY AND WOMEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Yehudah):</span> It says "Li'Shlomo Arba'im Elef Urvos Susim", and it says "Arba'as Alafim Uryos Susim"!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Before he married Bas Par'o (he engaged only in Chachmah), it had no importance; after he married her, it was like stones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> When Shlomo married Bas Par'o, Gavri'el inserted a reed in the sea. Dirt was deposited, and Romi was later built there.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> The reasons for two Mitzvos were revealed, and the greatest Chacham stumbled in them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Lo Yarbeh Lo Nashim" - Shlomo thought 'I will take many, they will not veer my heart';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Ultimately, they did "Hitu Es Levavo."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says "Lo Yarbeh Lo Susim" - Shlomo thought 'I will acquire many, and we will not return to Mitzrayim;</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>THE KING WRITES AN EXTRA SEFER TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He writes a Sefer Torah for himself.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Even if one inherited a Sefer Torah, it is a Mitzvah to write one himself - "Kisvu Lachem Es ha'Shirah ha'Zos."</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> Originally, the Torah was given to Yisrael in Lashon ha'Kodesh, in Ivri writing (forms of the letters);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the days of Ezra, it was given in Arame'ic, in Ashuris writing.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Ivri writing?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is writing in big letters (Rashi; R. Tam - it is a writing particular to a place called Libona'ah; Maharsha - it is the writing we were used to from Lavan's house).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Ezra was worthy that the Torah be given through him, just Moshe preceded him.</p>
