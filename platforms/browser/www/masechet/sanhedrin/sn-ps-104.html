<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOSPITALITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan citing R. Yosi ben Kisma):</span> Hospitality to guests is great. It dispelled two nations (Amon and Mo'av) from ever marrying into Yisrael - "Al Davar Asher Lo Kidmu Eschem ba'Lechem uva'Mayim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan himself):</span> It dispels those who were close (all of these will be explained), brings close those who were far, makes Hash-m overlook Resha'im, gives (true) prophecy to false Nevi'im of the Ba'al, and one who neglects it b'Shogeg is considered as if he intentionally sinned:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It dispels the close ones, i.e. Amon and Mo'av, who descend from Avraham's nephew Lot;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It brings close those who were far, i.e. Yisro.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Yisro's reward for "Kiren Lo v'Yochal Lechem" was that his descendants sat on the Great Sanhedrin in Lishkas ha'Gazis - "umi'Mishpechos Sofrim... ha'Kinim ha'Ba'im me'Chamas Avi Beis Rechav." (Yirmeyah prophesized that Bnei Rechav would be on the Sanhedrin), and it says "u'Vnei Keini Chosen Moshe.")</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It makes Hash-m overlook Resha'im, i.e. Michah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>It gives prophecy to false Nevi'im of the Ba'al, i.e. the man who gave Ido to eat - "va'Yhi Devar Hash-m El ha'Navi..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>One who neglects it b'Shogeg is considered as if he intentionally sinned. This refers to Yonason ben Sha'ul:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Had Yonason given David two loaves of bread, (David would not have needed to ask the Kohanim for bread, and) Sha'ul would not have killed the Kohanim of Nov, Do'eg would not have lost his share in the world to come (for informing on the Kohanim and killing them), and Sha'ul and his three sons would not have been killed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHY OTHER KINGS WERE NOT LISTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why isn't Achaz listed among those who have no share in the world to come?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> It is because his father (Yosam) and son (Chizkiyah) were Tzadikim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> It is because he was ashamed in front of Yeshayah - "Tzei Na Likras Achaz... El Mesilas Sede Choves";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it called "Choves"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Achaz was Kovesh (buried) his face (he was ashamed to look at Yeshayah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Achaz put a net of launderers (Kovsim) over his face, hoping that Yeshayah would not recognize him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why isn't Amon listed among those who have no share?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is due to the honor of Yoshiyahu (his son).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also Menasheh should not be listed, due to his father Chizkiyah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A son brings merit to his father, but a father does not bring merit to his son:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Ein mi'Yadi Matzil" - Avraham does not save Yishmael (from punishment. This is like the opinion that Yishmael did not repent), and Yitzchak does not save Esav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to this, we can answer similarly for Achaz! (Rav Yosef need not say that it is because he was ashamed in front of Yeshayah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why isn't Yehoyakim listed among those who have no share?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He got atonement through the disgrace of not being buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avuha):</span> It said on the skull of Yehoyakim 'this (the curse that it will not be buried) and one other (vengeance will be taken on it).'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Freida's grandfather found a skull by the gates of Yerushalayim. It said on it 'this and one other.' He buried it (twice, each time) it came up. He realized that it was the skull of Yehoyakim, about whom it says "Kevuras Chamor Yikaver...."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He reasoned that it is improper for a king to be disgraced. He wrapped it in silk and put it in a chest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>His wife found it. Neighbors told her that it is probably from his first wife, and he cannot forget her. She burned it in the oven. This was the other vengeance.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CHIZKIYAH'S MISTAKES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Chizkiyah asked to be healed in his own merit - "veha'Tov b'Einecha Asisi." This was a sin, and it led him to say "Mah Zos." (Also this was a mistake. It showed a lack of faith in what the Navi told him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Saying "Mah Zos" led him to show too much hospitality to Nochrim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Excess hospitality to Nochrim led to exile of his children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This supports (the Amora) Chizkiyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> "Umi'Banecha... Sarisim b'Heichal Melech Bavel" - anyone who invites a Nochri to his house and serves him, he causes his children to be exiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yismach Aleihem Chizkiyah va'Yar'em Es <i>Beis Nechoso</i>" - what was this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> His own wife gave them to drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> He showed them his treasure house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> He showed them iron that can shatter iron.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span></span>EXPOUNDING EICHAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Yisrael suffered the afflictions in Megilas Eichah because they transgressed the 36 Chayavei Kerisus (the Gematri'a of Eichah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Yisrael suffered the afflictions in Megilas Eichah, whose verses are ordered according to the Aleph-Beis, because they transgressed the Torah, written in the letters of the Aleph-Beis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> "Yoshvah Vadad" - Hash-m intended "va'Yishkon Yisrael Betach Badad..." (they would not need to band together for security). Due to their sins, they are alone as outcasts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> "Ha'Ir Rabasi Am" - they would marry young women to older men and vice-versa. This produces more children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Haysah <i>k</i>'Almanah" - not a real widow, rather, like a woman whose husband went overseas on condition to return.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> "Rabasi va'Goyim Sarasi ba'Medinos" - wherever they would go, they would be princes to their masters.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which two captives were taken from Har ha'Karmel. Their captor was in back of them. One captive (Reuven) told the other that the camel in front of them is blind in one eye, and is carrying a pouch of wine and a pouch of oil, and a Yisrael and Nochri are leading it.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">104b----------------------------------------104b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The captor:</span> How can you know?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> The camel eats only from the vegetation on one side, for it cannot see with the other eye. The drops of wine falling from the pouch sink into the ground, the drops of oil do not sink in. The Nochri relieves himself on the road itself, and the Yisrael goes to the side.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The captor ran to catch those travelling in front of them, and found that Reuven was right about everything. He kissed him on the head and made a feast for him when he got home. He danced and blessed Hash-m for giving such Chachmah to His chosen nation. He let them go free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> "Bacho Sivkeh" - the double verb prophesizes crying over another Churban (i.e. of the second Mikdash);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ba'Laylah" - the Churban resulted from what happened at night (after the Meraglim returned) - "va'Yivku ha'Am ba'Laylah ha'Hu."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> That night was the ninth of Av. Because they cried for no reason, Hash-m decreed to establish crying for all generations on that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Alternatively, the verse discusses crying at night, for then the crying is heard more than during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Alternatively, when one cries at night, the stars and constellations cry with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Alternatively, when one cries at night, anyone who hears him cries with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The son of Raban Gamliel's neighbor died. His mother was crying at night. Raban Gamliel cried with her until his eyelashes became soaked and covered his eyes. The next day, his Talmidim noticed this and made her move away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> "V'Dim'asah Al Lecheyah" - like a woman crying over the husband she married in her youth, "Eli ki'Vsulah Chaguras Sak Al Ba'al Ne'ureha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> "Hayu Tzareha l'Rosh" - whatever nation afflicts Yisrael becomes the dominant power (Tosfos - beforehand, lest people say that Yisrael fell to a lowly nation).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> "Ki Lo Mu'af la'Asher Mutzak Lah" - whatever nation afflicts Yisrael does not weary.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> "Lo Aleichem..." teaches Kuvlana (when telling one's afflictions, he must say that it should not come upon the listener. Alternatively, one should tell his afflictions to others).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Amram):</span> "Kol Ovrei Derech" - Yerushalayim has been punished like Sedom, which was <i>Over</i> Al Da'as (transgressed basic laws):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says about Sedom "va'Shem Himtir Al Sedom Gafris va'Ed Sheker ha'Ed." Regarding Yerushalayim it says "mi'Marom Sholach Esh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yigdal Avon Bas Ami me'Chatas Sedom" - was Hash-m partial to Yerushalayim (to leave a remnant, unlike Sedom; alternatively - that He sent the fire through a Shali'ach, and not by Himself)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Sedom it says "...Siv'as Lechem...v'Yad Oni v'Evyon Lo Hechezikah." Regarding Yerushalayim it says "Nashim Rachamaniyos Bishlu Yaldeihem":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> This attribute of Yerushalayim (women would share the flesh of their children with others) partially atoned for it, therefore Yerushalayim was not punished as harshly as Sedom (which lacked this attribute).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> In this respect, Yerushalayim was punished harsher than Sedom. Hash-m was not partial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>"Silah Kol Abirei Hash-m" - Hash-m rendered the mighty ones useless, like a coin that was Nifsal (disqualified).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> The verses of (the first four chapters of) Eichah are according to the Aleph-Beis, except for 'Pei', which comes before 'Ayin.' What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Churban resulted from the Meraglim, whose sin was to put the Peh (mouth) in front of the Ayin (eye, i.e. they decided to give a derogatory report before seeing the land).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> "Ochlei Ami Ochlu Lechem" - only those who eat the bread of Yisrael truly taste bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Hash-m Lo Kora'u" - (Nochrim ate our bread because) our judges perverted justice (Ben Yehoyada - they were not worthy to be called Elohim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> (It was because) the teachers of children taught improperly (learning from a Rebbi <i>should be</i> like learning from Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THOSE WHO HAVE NO SHARE IN THE WORLD TO COME</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who compiled the list (in the Mishnah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The Great Assembly made the list.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> They wanted to include Shlomo. The image of David came and bowed in front of them (not to include him). They paid no attention;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A fire came from Shamayim and singed the benches. They paid no attention;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Bas Kol said "Ish Mahir bi'Mlachto Lifnei Melachim Yisyatzav Bal Yisyatzev Lifnei Chashuchim (in Gehinom)" - Shlomo built the Mikdash before his house, and rushed to build it quicker (in seven years) than his house (in 13 years). They paid no attention;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Bas Kol said "hame'Imach Yeshalmenah Ki Mo'asta Ki Atah Tivchar v'Lo Ani"! (Hash-m decides whom He will reward and punish.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Expounders say that even those in the Mishnah have a share in the world to come. "Li Gil'ad" refers to Achav, who died in Ramos Gil'ad;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Menasheh" refers to Menasheh. "Efrayim Ma'oz Roshi" refers to Yarav'am (who was from Shevet Efrayim). "Yehudah Mechokeki" refers to Achitofel, of Shevet Yehudah.</p>
