<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE JUDGES NEEDED FOR ADMISSIONS AND LOANS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If commoners may judge, they should be exempt if they err!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All the more so, this would discourage loans!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (against Answer #1):</span> If theft and wounds require Mumchim but admissions and loans do not, what forced R. Avahu to say that 'theft and wounds' explains monetary cases? He should have said simply, that monetary cases, i.e. admissions and loans, need three commoners, but theft and wounds require three Mumchim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> (If theft and wounds are examples of monetary cases) why does it say 'three judges' regarding monetary cases, and again regarding theft and wounds?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 3:a, Daf 2b - Rava):</span> (Eruv Parshiyos applies here. Mid'Oraisa, three Mumchim are needed also for admissions and loans.) The Mishnah teaches two different laws. (Theft and wounds require three Mumchim, like Torah law. Mid'Rabanan, three commoners suffice for monetary cases, i.e. admissions and loans,) for R. Chanina's reason (lest people refrain from lending).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> (Rashi - Eruv Parshiyos does not apply here. Tosfos - even if it does,) mid'Oraisa, one judge (even a commoner) suffices for admissions and loans - "b'Tzedek Tishpot Amisecha";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mid'Rabanan, we require three judges, lest an ignoramus give the wrong verdict.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even with three judges, we should be concerned for unlearned judges!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely, at least one of the three people has learned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should say that if they erred, they are exempt (Rashi - because they are allowed to judge; Tosfos - lest learned people fear to judge)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All the more so, this would encourage unlearned people to judge!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Practically,) what is the difference between Rava and Rav Acha?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about Shmuel's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If two judged a monetary case, the verdict stands, just it is called an impudent Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava argues with Shmuel, and Rav Acha agrees with Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHY DAMAGE WAS INCLUDED IN THE MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Theft and wounds... damage, half-damage...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Damage is identical to wounds (whether an animal or person hit a person)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes, there was no need to teach damage. It was taught only along with half-damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also half-damage is wounds!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Tana teaches fines (payments not equal to the damage, only witnesses obligate one to pay them) and 'Mamon' (payments that are not fines; even one's admission obligates him to pay).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that half-damage is a fine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that half-damage is Mamon, what can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Because he needed to teach double payment, four and five, which are more than the principal, he also teaches half-damage, which is less than the principal.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he teaches half-damage, he also teaches damage.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SOURCE FOR THREE JUDGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that three judges are needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah):</span> "V'Nikrav Ba'al ha'Bayis El <i>ha'Elohim</i>" teaches one. "Ad <i>ha'Elohim</i> Yavo Devar Sheneihem" teaches a second. "Asher Yarshi'un <i>ha'Elohim</i>" teaches a third;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yonasan says, the first time 'ha'Elohim' is said, it is needed to teach that Mumchim are required, we cannot expound it to teach the number of judges;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We expound the other two, to teach two judges; we do not make a Beis Din with an even number of judges, so we add a third.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about whether or not we expound the first occurrence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree that (normally) we do not expound the first occurrence;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, R. Yoshiyah expounds it, because it should have said 'Shofet' (judge). Rather, the Torah said "ha'Elohim", to teach about how many are required.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yonasan says, this merely suggests that someone with a case should go to a Mumcheh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yoshiyah argue with the rule 'we do not make a Beis Din with an even number of judges'?! (A verse teaches this!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer son of R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> "Lintos Acharei Rabim Lehatos" a Beis Din must lean (there is always a majority, i.e. there are an odd number of judges).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Yes. He holds like R. Yehudah, who says that the Great Sanhedrin has 70 judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Great Sanhedrin has 71 judges;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, it has 70.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yehudah says so only about the Great Sanhedrin, for he expounds a verse. We have no source that he permits a regular Beis Din with an even number of judges!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we do not distinguish between the Great Sanhedrin and smaller Batei Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Three judges are needed for Semichah of judges and for the beheaded calf;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah says, five are needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Samechu" teaches two judges. "Ziknei" teaches two judges. A Beis Din cannot have an even number of judges, so we add a fifth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Yoshiyah holds like R. Yehudah, and says a larger Chidush;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah said only that the Great Sanhedrin can have an even number of judges. R. Yoshiyah says so even about smaller Batei Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he learn from "Lintos"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches about a Sanhedrin judging a capital case. It must have an odd number of judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yoshiyah - Mishnah):</span> If two judges say that he is innocent, and one says that he is guilty, he is innocent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If two say that he is guilty, and one says that he is innocent, he is guilty;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If R. Yoshiyah learns from verses that three judges are needed, all three must agree to make a verdict!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that we follow the majority;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We follow the majority even in capital cases, and all the more so in monetary cases!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>REBBI REQUIRES FIVE JUDGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three judges are needed for monetary cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rebbi says, five judges are needed, so there will be a majority.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even with three judges, there will always be a majority!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, we need five judges in order that at least three will agree to the verdict.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that the three judges learned from verses must agree to make a verdict.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Avahu):</span> If so, the Great Sanhedrin should require 141 judges, so 71 will agree to the verdict, and a small Sanhedrin should need 45, so 23 will agree!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, "Esfah Li Shiv'im Ish" teaches that it suffices to gather 70 (not counting Moshe, we are not concerned how many agree to the verdict). "V'Shaftu ha'Edah... v'Hitzilu ha'Edah" - we care only about how many judges deliberate;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Likewise, "v'Nikrav Ba'al ha'Bayis El ha'Elohim" - the concern is how many judges he approaches (not how many agree to the verdict).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Rather, Rebbi learns from "Asher <i>Yarshi'un</i> ha'Elohim" - the plural form teaches two judges;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Likewise, "Ad ha'Elohim Yavo Devar Sheneihem" teaches two judges (we do not expound the first occurrence);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Beis Din cannot have an even number of judges, so we add a fifth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Chachamim argue, for "Yarshi'un" is written missing a 'Vav', as if it was the singular 'Yarshi'an'.</p>
