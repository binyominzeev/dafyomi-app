<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MAY NOCHRIM LEARN TORAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A Nochri who learns Torah is Chayav Misah. "Torah... Morashah Kehilas Yakov", it is an inheritance for Yisrael, but not for Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why isn't this included among his seven Mitzvos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is included in theft;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> According to the opinion that expounds it is as if said Me'orasah (Torah is the Arusah of  Yisrael), it is included in Arayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a Nochri engages in Torah, he receives reward like a Kohen Gadol - "Asher Ya'aseh Osam <i>ha'Adam</i> va'Chai";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It does not say that <i>Yisraelim</i> will live through the Mitzvos, rather, Adam. This teaches that if a Nochri engages in Torah, he is rewarded like a Kohen Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is rewarded for learning his seven Mitzvos (but liable for anything else).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BLOOD OF A LIVING ANIMAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chanina ben Gamliel):</span> A Nochri is liable even for eating blood of a living animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ach Basar b'Nafsho Damo Lo Sochelu" refers to Ever Min ha'Chai;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Chanina ben Gamliel says, this also includes blood of a living animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We expound the verse as if it said 'Basar b'Nafsho Lo Sochelu, Damo b'Nafsho Lo Sochelu';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, this comes to permit (limbs of living) Sheratzim (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina ben Gamliel):</span> Similarly, blood of a living animal is forbidden to Yisrael - "... l'Vilti Achol ha'Dam Ki ha'Dam Hu ha'Nefesh" (do not eat blood while it is connected to the soul, i.e. while the animal is alive).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, this forbids Dam ha'Nefesh of bloodletting (i.e. as long as it is flowing).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MITZVOS GIVEN TO BENEI NOACH AND YISRAEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Torah forbid blood of a living animal to Bnei Noach, and again to Yisrael?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina taught, that any Mitzvah said to Bnei Noach (it appears in the Torah before Ma'amad Har Sinai) that is repeated at (or after) Sinai, applies to Bnei Noach and Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Any Mitzvah said to Bnei Noach that is not repeated at Sinai, applies only to Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The only example we have is Gid ha'Nasheh, according to R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi's first law is illogical!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Had it not been repeated, we would say that it applies to Bnei Noach and to Yisrael. Presumably, we just received more Mitzvos at Sinai, but we did not lose Mitzvos). Since the Mitzvah was repeated, this should teach that it applies only to Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We find that Nochrim were punished for idolatry (surely, they were commanded), and idolatry was repeated at Sinai. This teaches that such Mitzvos apply to Nochrim and Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Yosi say that a Mitzvah said to Bnei Noach and not repeated at Sinai applies only to Yisrael? This should indicate that it applies only to Nochrim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We never find something permitted to a Yisrael, but forbidden to a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yafes To'ar is permitted to a Yisrael, but forbidden to a Nochri!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is only because it does not apply to them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Yafes To'ar applies only during conquest.) This does not apply to Nochrim. (The Ya'avetz, Rashash and Chasam Sofer ask, we find that Nochrim can conquer land and take slaves (Gitin 38a)! Margoliyos ha'Yam (32) answers that they acquire a slave only for labor, but do not acquire the person himself (Ran 57a), and this is not enough for Yefas To'ar.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Nochrim are killed for stealing less than the value of a Perutah. A Yisrael is exempt for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yisraelim are commanded about theft like Nochrim are;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nochrim are liable because they do not pardon such an amount. Yisraelim are exempt because they pardon it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that a Mitzvah said to Bnei Noach and repeated applies to both. Milah was said before Sinai ("v'Atah Es Brisi Tishmor") and after ("uva'Yom ha'Shemini Yimol"), yet it applies only to Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">59b----------------------------------------59b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The latter verse is needed to permit Milah on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mitzvah to have children was said before Sinai ("Peru u'Rvu") and after ("Shuvu Lachem l'Ohaleichem"), yet it applies only to Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The latter verse is needed to teach that something forbidden by a vote of Beis Din is not permitted until Beis Din votes to permit it (even if they forbade for a limited time, similar to the Isur of Bi'ah that Hash-m imposed before Ma'amad Har Sinai, and He needed to permit it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we can say that every Mitzvah repeated after Sinai was repeated for a certain Chidush (and applies only to Yisrael)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When the warning not to transgress is repeated, this shows that it applies to Bnei Noach and Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHO IS COMMANDED ABOUT MILAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina said that the only Mitzvah (said to Bnei Noach that is not repeated) is Gid ha'Nasheh, according to R. Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(It is as if) also Milah and Peru u'Rvu were not repeated!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were repeated, but to teach a different matters (like we said);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Only Gid ha'Nasheh was not repeated at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (k)):</span> Milah was never given to all Bnei Noach, only to Avraham - "v'Atah Es Brisi Tishmor Atah <i>v'Zar'acha Acharecha</i>."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also Bnei Yishmael should be commanded about Milah. Also they descend from Avraham!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ki v'Yitzchak Yikarei Lecha Zara" (only Yitzchak's descendants are considered Avraham's seed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Bnei Esav should be commanded about Milah, they also descend from Yitzchak!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "<i>v</i>'Yitzchak" (in, i.e.) part of Yitzchak (i.e. only descendants of Yakov).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Oshaya):</span> If so, Bnei Keturah (Avraham's children after he remarried Hagar) should not be commanded about Milah, for they do not descend from Yitzchak;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi bar Avin taught that "Es Brisi Hefar" comes to include Bnei Keturah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>MEAT WAS NOT PERMITTED TO ADAM HA'RISHON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Adam ha'Rishon was not allowed to (kill animals to) eat meat. "(All vegetation) Lachem Yihyeh l'Ochlah ul'Chol Chayas ha'Sadeh" - the animals are not Lachem (for man to eat);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After the flood, it was permitted - "k'Yerek Esev Nosati Lachem Es Kol."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps even a limb of a living animal was permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ach Basar b'Nafsho Damo Lo Sochelu."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps even limbs of living Sheratzim are forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ach" always excludes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does this teach that Sheratzim are excluded?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> (The verse needlessly says) "Damo". This alludes to something whose blood is distinguished (in Halachah) from the flesh (i.e. animals. Blood of Sheratzim is has the same law as the flesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "U'Rdu (be master over) bi'Dgas ha'Yam" authorized man to eat fish!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it authorized him to force fish to work for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can fish work?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! Rachbah's question proves this.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rachbah):</span> If one harnessed a fish and a goat to pull a wagon together, is he liable (for Kilai Behemah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "(U'Rdu...) uv'Of ha'Shamayim" authorized man to eat birds!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it authorized him to force birds to work for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can birds work?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! Rabah bar Rav Huna's question proves this.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> According to R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah (who says that a worker's right to eat (and the Isur to muzzle an animal) is only when he (or it) works with his feet and hands (forelegs), if one threshes with geese and chickens, what is the law? (Does the right to eat depend on working with four limbs, or that none of the four limbs are idle?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "(U'Rdu...) uv'Chol Chayah ha'Romeses Al ha'Aretz." (Surely, this authorized man to eat Chayos. One cannot use them to work!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it authorized him to force snakes to work for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Menasya):</span> Had the snake not been cursed (and lost its legs), it would have been a great servant. Every Yisrael would have had two, to find gems for him, and to fertilize his field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Yehudah ben Teima):</span> In Gan Eden, angels were roasting meat and straining wine for Adam ha'Rishon to eat and drink. The snake saw Adam's honor and became jealous.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They brought him meat that fell from Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does meat fall from Shamayim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! R. Shimon ben Chalafta encountered lions. They roared at him (they wanted to eat him). He said "ha'Kefirim Sho'agim la'Taref" - two pieces of meat came down (from Shamayim). The lions ate one. He took the other to the Beis Medrash, and asked if it was Tahor or Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Tamei things do not descend from Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If an animal resembling a donkey descended from Shamayim, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> We already said that Tamei things do not descend from Shamayim. (Surely, such an animal would not fall. If it did, it would be Tahor.)</p>
