<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>STONING BY BEIS DIN (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Torah needed to write "Even" and "Avanim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it written only "Even", one might have thought that whether or not he died from one rock (Tosfos - and it was lost), we do not bring more to kill him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it written only "Avanim", one might have thought that we bring two to begin with.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana learned from a Gezerah Shavah from Par He'elem Davar. Why does Rav Papa learn from different verses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana means, had it not said the verses from which Rav Papa learns, we would have learned from the Gezerah Shavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since it says the other verses, we do not need the Gezerah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 3:h, 42b - Rav Ashi):</span> Moshe was in Machaneh Levi, and Hash-m told him "Hotzei Es ha'Mekalel" - outside of Machaneh Levi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"<i>El</i> mi'Chutz la'Machaneh" teaches outside of Machaneh Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Va'Yotzi'u Es ha'Mekalel..." teaches that Yisrael did as they were commanded.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "U'Vnei Yisrael Asu" already teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One verse teaches Semichah (the witnesses put their hands on his head), and (Rashi; our text - the other teaches) pushing him off a platform.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rav Ashi learn from the verses of Par He'elem Davar?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CALLING BACK THE DEFENDANT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ploni stands (at the door of Beis Din, holding a flag...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> It is obvious to me that the Tzibur pays for the following: the boulder for stoning, the beam for hanging, the sword, and the garment for choking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not tell someone to pay for his own death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Huna):</span> Who pays for the flag and the horse (to call him back if someone finds Zechus)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since they are for his benefit, he pays for them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since Beis Din is commanded to have them, they must pay for them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> R. Chiya bar Rav Ashi taught that before killing someone, we give to him a cup of wine with frankincense inside (to befuddle him) - "Tenu Shechar l'Oved v'Yayin l'Marei Nafesh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Important women of Yerushalayim would donate this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they did not donate it, who pays for it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, the Tzibur should pay - "Tenu Shechar..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Huna):</span> If one of the Talmidim said that he has a reason for Zechus and then he went mute, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> Will we say 'perhaps someone anywhere in the world has a reason for Zechus but went mute?' (If we would be concerned for this, we could never kill anyone)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here is different, for the Talmid said that he has a reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina taught that if a Talmid was Mezakeh (gave a reason for Zechus, after which he is counted among the judges) and died, we consider that he is still Mezakeh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is only if he was Mezakeh, and his reason was not rejected.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This does not answer the case when we never heard his reason (the question is not resolved).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even if the defendant himself gives a reason for Zechus, we return him to Beis Din, even four or five times, on condition that it is a proper reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Even the first two times, we return him only if he gave a proper reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> The first two times we return him whether or not he gave a proper reason. After this, we only return for a proper reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah discusses after the first two times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do the people taking him know whether or not his reason is proper? (They need not be Chachamim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We send two Chachamim with him to discern if his reason is proper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should send Chachamim with him from the beginning, and return only if his reason is proper!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps because he is afraid, he cannot express himself properly.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ANNOUNCING THE EXECUTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they find Zechus for him, they exempt him immediately. If not, he is taken to be stoned. they announce in front of him 'Reuven is being taken to be killed for this transgression. Ploni and Almoni are the witnesses. If anyone knows Zechus, come and give it'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Abaye):</span> They must announce the time and place he transgressed, so if anyone was with the witnesses elsewhere at the time, he will come to be Mezim them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They announce in front of him...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They announce only when he is being taken to be executed, but not before.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>(There is a discussion which was censored from the text; we omit it.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">43b----------------------------------------43b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Anyone who slaughters his evil inclination (repents after having succumbed) and confesses, the Torah considers it as if he honored Hash-m in two worlds, i.e. this world and the next - "Zove'ach Todah Yechabdaneni" (the letter 'Nun' is doubled).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> One who brought a Korban in the Mikdash was only credited for that Korban. If one has a broken spirit, the Torah considers it as if he brought all the Korbanos - "Lev Nishbar v'Nidkeh Elokim Lo Tivzeh."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CONFESSION BEFORE EXECUTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When he was 10 Amos from Beis ha'Skilah, they would tell him to confess;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Everyone killed by Beis Din confesses, for everyone who confesses has a share in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We find that Yehoshua told Achan "Beni Sim Na Chavod... v'Sen Lo Sodah", and he confessed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that this atoned for him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yakorcha Hash-m ba'Yom ha'Zeh" - today you are sullied, but not in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he does not know how to confess, we tell him to say 'this should atone for all my sins.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, if he knows that he was framed, he says 'this should atone for all my sins <i>except for</i> this that I am being killed for (I am innocent, I need no atonement for it).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If so, everyone will say this to clear himself!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>ACHAN'S CONFESSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Na" is an expression of request;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Hash-m told Yehoshua "Chota Yisrael", Yehoshua asked who had sinned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I am not a talebearer! Cast lots.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The lot fell on Achan. He protested:</span> 'if I would cast a lot on you and the Kohen Gadol, it would fall on one of you. It would not prove that one of you is guilty (likewise, I am innocent)!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Yehoshua:</span> Do not slander the lottery, for it will be used to divide Eretz Yisrael - "Ach b'Goral Yechalek Es ha'Aretz."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> "Sen (Lo) Sodah" - Yehoshua made him think that he merely desires a confession, but he will not be killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> "Chotasi... vecha'Zos vecha'Zos Asisi" - three times Achan took things forbidden by Cherem, twice in Moshe's time, and once in Yehoshua's time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He transgressed four times in Moshe's time, once in Yehoshua's time (we expound the 'Vov' in each '<i>ve</i>cha'Zos' ).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why weren't Yisrael punished for his previous transgressions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Yisrael were not punished for hidden transgressions (of others) until they crossed the Yarden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tana'im argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Ha'Nistaros la'Shem Elokeinu veha'Niglos Lanu ul'Vaneinu Ad Olam" - there are dots over "Lanu ul'Vaneinu" and the 'Ayin' of "Ad" to teach that Yisrael were not punished for hidden transgressions until they crossed the Yarden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Nechemyah:</span> Yisrael are never punished for hidden things. It says "Ad Olam"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, just like Yisrael were not punished for hidden things before crossing the Yarden, they were not punished for open transgressions (of others) until they crossed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why were Yisrael punished for Achan's transgression?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His wife and children knew about it (this is considered open).</p>
