<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A MURDERER WHO WAS MIXED WITH OTHERS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava - Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> The law of the Mishnah applies even if Aba Chalifta (a great Chasid) is among them! (This shows that we discuss people. This also refutes R. Avahu, for if we know that all of them murdered, it makes no difference if one used to be a great Tzadik.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah discusses two people who were standing together, and one of them shot an arrow (the witnesses did not see which) and it killed someone. Both are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi says (in the Beraisa) that this applies even if Aba Chalifta was one of the two (and surely, the other shot the arrow)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a sentenced ox was mixed with regular oxen, we stone all of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, we put them in Kipah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a cow gored and gave birth before it was sentenced, the calf is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it gave birth after it was sentenced, one may not benefit from the calf;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the cow became mixed with other cows, and those became mixed with other cows, we put all of them in Kipah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, Beis Din stones them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS THE CHILD OF A SENTENCED COW FORBIDDEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a cow gored and gave birth before it was sentenced, the calf is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is even if the cow was pregnant with the calf at the time of the goring!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava taught that the calf of a cow that gored is forbidden (to be a Korban if) it (was inside at the time, so its weight) participated in the goring;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a man was Rove'a a cow, the calf is forbidden, for it was also party to the bestiality!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 - Correction (Beraisa):</span> Rather, if a cow gored, became pregnant and gave birth before it was sentenced, the calf is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it became pregnant and gave birth after it was sentenced, the calf is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that forbids Zeh v'Zeh Gorem (something that results from two (or more) causes, and one of the causes is forbidden. Here, the calf's mother is forbidden, and its father is permitted);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">80b----------------------------------------80b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to the opinion that permits Zeh v'Zeh Gorem, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> Rather, we correct the Beraisa to say as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a cow gored, became pregnant and gave birth before it was sentenced, the calf is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it gored, became pregnant, was sentenced and then gave birth, the calf is forbidden. A fetus is considered part of its mother (so it was sentenced with its mother).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MURDERERS WHO BECAME MIXED UP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If people sentenced...(they all receive the lightest Misah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This teaches warning for a severe Misah includes warning for lighter Misos (therefore, we can give a lighter Misah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yirmeyah):</span> No, the case is, they were not warned about any particular Misah. The Mishnah is not like R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> For all other capital transgressions (except for Mesis, who need not be warned), one is killed only through a Sanhedrin, witnesses and warning, and if they told him that he is Chayav Misah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, they must tell him which Misah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The first Tana learns from the Mekoshesh; (he was not warned which Misah he would receive, for even Moshe did not know until he asked Hash-m, and even so he was killed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, he was killed according to Hora'as Sha'ah (a special ruling for a particular need at the time. Letter of the law he was exempt, for he was not warned which Misah he would receive).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If people sentenced to be stoned became mixed...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Yechezkeil was teaching (his text of) our Mishnah to his son Rami:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If people sentenced to be burned became mixed with people sentenced to be stoned, R. Shimon says, we stone them, for this is more lenient;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah (Rami's brother):</span> Father, do not teach that text. It connotes that if stoning were more stringent, we would burn them. This is not true, for the majority were sentenced to be stoned! ('X became mixed with Y' connotes that there is more Y than X.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yechezkeil:</span> Should I teach 'if people sentenced to be stoned became mixed with people sentenced to be burned, R. Shimon says that we stone them, for this is more lenient'?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If so, the Seifa must say 'Chachamim say, we burn them, for this is more lenient';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Since the majority were sentenced to be burned, we would burn them even if burning was not more lenient! (This text is equally problematic!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> This is not problematic. Chachamim did not say that burning is more lenient to explain their law, rather, to argue with R. Shimon who said that stoning is more lenient.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Shmuel (to Rav Yehudah):</span> Do not speak that way to your father!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sees his father transgress a Torah law, he should not say 'father, you transgressed' (for this would embarrass him). Rather, he asks 'father, is this what the Torah says?!''</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is equally embarrassing!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he says 'father, the Torah says...' (the father will understand by himself that he transgressed).</p>
