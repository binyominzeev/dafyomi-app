<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE EXEMPTION OF METZAMTZEM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mesharshiya):</span> Rav Acha bar Rav exempted due to a verse:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Mos Yumas ha'Makeh Rotze'ach Hu" - a murderer is liable for Metzamtzem, but a damager is not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LEAVING SOMEONE TO DIE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven tied up Shimon and Shimon starved to death, Reuven is exempt. (The cause of death, i.e. hunger, came by itself.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven tied up Shimon in a hot sun or in the cold and he died from this, Reuven is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he tied him up before the sun shone there or before it was cold, but knowing that the sun or cold will later come, he is exempt. (This is only Grama, i.e. causation.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven tied up Shimon in front of a lion, he is exempt (Rashi - Shimon could not have escaped even if he was not tied up; Tosfos - since Reuven had time to tie him up, surely the lion was not yet upon him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he tied him up in front of a swarm of mosquitoes and they killed him, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Even if he tied him up in front of mosquitoes, he is exempt. (Perhaps) the ones chasing him went away, and others came and killed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava or R. Zeira):</span> If Reuven tied a barrel over Shimon (and he suffocated) or he uncovered the roof over him (allowing the cold in, which killed him) he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rava and R. Zeira):</span> He is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Rava must exempt, for Rava taught that if he tied him up and he starved to death, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Zeira must exempt, for he taught that if Levi locked Yehudah in a marble house and lit a fire (and the heat killed him), he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had <i>he</i> not lit the fire, he would be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, had he not lit the fire, he would be exempt because the cause of death (the heat) did not begin yet.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">77b----------------------------------------77b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he tied a barrel over him, the (lack of air, the analog of the) heat is there from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven pushed Shimon into a pit with a ladder, and Yehudah or even Reuven himself removed the ladder (leaving Shimon to die), he is exempt, because when he pushed him in, it was possible to leave. (Removing the ladder is only Grama.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Shimon was holding a shield, and Reuven shot an arrow at him, and Yehudah or even Reuven himself removed the shield, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because his liability the arrow ended at the time he shot it (it was not prone to kill. Removing the shield is only Grama.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Shimon was holding medicine (that could heal him from being hit with an arrow), and Reuven shot an arrow at him, and Yehudah or even Reuven himself removed the medicine, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because when he shot the arrow, Shimon could have cured himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Therefore, even if Shimon was not holding medicine but he could buy it in the market, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If when Reuven shot the arrow Shimon did not have a way to obtain medicine, and later Shimon had an opportunity but did not cure himself, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Once Shimon had an opportunity to cure himself, Reuven is permanently exempted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BOUNCING A BALL OFF A WALL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven threw a rock at a wall and it bounced back and killed, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If Levi was playing with a ball (to bounce it off a wall), and it bounced back and killed someone:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Levi was Mezid, he is killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was Shogeg, he is exiled (he must stay in an Ir Miklat).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This law (Galus) is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is the first law, that if he was Mezid, he is killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One might have thought that since it is not clear that it will bounce back, the warning is doubtful and he is exempt. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tachlifa bar Ma'arava - Beraisa):</span> If Levi was playing with a ball (like above) and it bounced and killed someone within four Amos (of the wall), he is exempt (from Galus; some explain, from Misas Beis Din). Outside of four Amos, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he wanted it to go that far, he should be liable even within four Amos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he did not want it to go that far, he should be exempt even outside four Amos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> People who play with balls want the ball to bounce back as far as possible. (We assume that he did not want it to go less than four Amos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> (Since he is liable, this shows that) bouncing a ball off a wall is considered one's Ko'ach (impetus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven wanted to be Mekadesh (put ashes of the Parah Adumah on) water, and the ashes fell on his hand or on the side of the Keli holding the water and from there to the water, the Kidush is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the ashes came to rest, and then fell (by themselves, and not because he initially dropped them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a needle was on earthenware, and one sprinkled Mei Chatas, and he is unsure if it went directly on the needle or if it fell on the earthenware and from there Mitzah (spurted) to the needle, the sprinkling is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chinena bar Yehudah):</span> The text should say 'Matza' (it was found) on the needle (the earthenware is inclined. Perhaps it flowed down not due to human Ko'ach.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If Reuven tied up Shimon and directed water to onto him, and it killed him, Reuven is liable for murder, for his action killed him. It is as if he shot an arrow at him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if he was right by Shimon when he directed the water. If not, he only <i>caused</i> the death, so he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If Reuven threw a rock up and it came down and killed someone to the side, he is liable. (It killed due to Reuven's Ko'ach, not just due to gravity).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> If it moved due to his Ko'ach, it should have continued in the direction he threw it, i.e. up!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Papa):</span> If it is not his Ko'ach, it should have gone straight down!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Rather, the sideways movement is a weak component of Reuven's Ko'ach.</p>
