<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A blasphemer is liable only if he explicitly says Hash-m's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah says, during the trial, the witnesses use a euphemism (e.g. Yosi) for Hash-m's name. They say (that the blasphemer said) 'Yosi should strike Yosi';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After reaching a verdict of guilty, before killing him we tell everyone else to leave, and we ask the greatest witness to say the exact words that he heard;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He does so. The judges stand, tear their clothing and may never sew it back;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The second witness says 'I heard like he did.' If there are more witnesses, each says (one after the other) 'I heard like he did.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> He is liable only if he curses Hash-m with Hash-m's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> "V'Nokev Shem... b'Nokvo Shem Yumas" (there must be two mentions of Hash-m's name).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that "Nokev" refers to cursing?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Mah Ekov Lo Kabo E-l";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are warned not to do so from "Elokim Lo Sekalel."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps 'Nokev' means making a hole in Hash-m's name, like it says "va'Yikov Chor b'Dalto";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The warning not to do so would be "v'Ibadtem Es Shemam... Lo Sa'asun Ken la'Shem Elokeichem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Isur is 'Nokev Shem' <i>with</i> Hash-m's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he puts two names of Hash-m one on top of the other, and cuts both!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That is 'Nokev Shem' twice. It is not 'Nokev Shem <i>ba</i>'Shem' (using Hash-m's name).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he carves Hash-m's name on the end of a knife, and cuts Hash-m's name with it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The blade makes the hole. Hash-m's name does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it means to explicitly say Hash-m's name - "Asher Nikvu b'Shemos";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The warning not to do so would be "Es Hash-m Elokecha Tira."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That is not 'Nokev Shem' <i>with</i> Hash-m's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Es Hash-m Elokecha Tira" is an Aseh. It is not a warning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (and Answer #2 to all the other questions):</span> (It says about the man killed for Nokev Shem) "va'Yikov... va'Ykalel," i.e. he cursed Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps one is not liable until he does both (Nokev and blasphemy)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Hotzei Es ha'Mekalel." It does not say that he was taken to be stoned for Nokev and blasphemy. This teaches that Nokev is blasphemy.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>NOCHRIM ARE LIABLE FOR BLASPHEMY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ish <i>Ish</i> (Ki Yekalel Elokav)" includes Nochrim. They are warned against blasphemy like Yisraelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are killed by the sword. This is the punishment for any of their transgressions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A different verse teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"(Va'Ytzav) Hash-m (Elokim Al ha'Adam)" teaches about blasphemy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> "Ish Ish..." teaches that Nochrim are liable for blasphemy with Kinuyim (other names of Hash-m). The Beraisa is like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Ish Ish Ki Yekalel Elokav v'Nasa Chet'o"? It already says "v'Nokev Shem Hash-m Mos Yumas"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that "v'Nokev Shem" obligates only for the special (four letter) name of Hash-m. "Ish Ki Yekalel <i>Elokav</i>" (this is not Hash-m's special name) obligates for Kinuyim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, one is killed for Hash-m's special name. One who curses a Kinuy transgresses a Lav. (Presumably, if a Yisrael is not killed for Kinuyim, Nochrim are not commanded about this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yitzchak Nafcha argues with R. Meisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Meisha):</span> If a Nochri cursed a Kinuy, Chachamim say that he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ka'Ger ka'Ezrach" - a Ger (convert) or Ezrach (Ben Yisrael) is liable only for "b'Nokvo Shem" (Hash-m's special name), but a Nochri is liable for Kinuyim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Meir learn from "ka'Ger ka'Ezrach"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Ger or Ezrach is stoned, but a Nochri is beheaded;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One might have thought that since the verse includes Nochrim, they receive the same Misah. "Ka'Ger ka'Ezrach" teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yitzchak Nafcha, what do Chachamim learn from "ka'Ger ka'Ezrach"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Ger or Ezrach is liable only for cursing 'Shem ba'Shem.' A Nochri is liable for any blasphemy.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SEVEN MITZVOS OF BENEI NOACH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Nochrim must observe seven Mitzvos: Dinim (to set up courts to enforce civil laws), and Isurim against blasphemy, idolatry, Arayos, murder, theft, and Ever Min ha'Chai (eating a limb of a living animal).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Chananyah ben Gamliel says, they are also forbidden to eat blood of a living animal;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon says, also Kishuf (witchcraft) is forbidden to them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R.

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah does not punish without warning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Eliezer says, they are commanded about Kilayim (crossbreeding) animals and grafting diverse trees onto each other;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yitzchak):</span> "Va'Ytzav" refers to idolatry. "Elokim" refers to Dinim (the others are like R. Yochanan taught).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about a Nochri who made an idol but did not serve it yet;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we learn from "<i>Asu</i> Lahem Masechah" , he is liable once he makes it;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei Menasheh):</span> The seven Mitzvos of Bnei Noach are idolatry, Arayos, murder, theft, a limb of a living animal, castration and Kilayim.</p>
