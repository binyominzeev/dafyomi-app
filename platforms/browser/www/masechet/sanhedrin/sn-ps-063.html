<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LIABILITY FOR MANY <i>AVODOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If someone did Zevichah, Haktarah and Nisuch in one He'elem, he is liable only one Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> He learns from "v'Lo So'ovdem" that all Avodos are considered one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Abaye taught that they are not one!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Hishtachava'ah is mentioned three times regarding idolatry. One obligates for bowing when this is its normal Avodah, one obligates when it is not the normal Avodah, and one is Mechalek the Avodos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Abaye merely explains R. Ami's reasoning. He argues with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Hishtachava'ah is mentioned three times regarding idolatry. One obligates for bowing when this is its normal Avodah, one obligates when it is not the normal Avodah, and one is Mechalek the Avodos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Eichah Ya'avdu" already obligates for its normal Avodah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, one obligates bowing when this resembles its normal Avodah (i.e. the idolatry is normally served in an honorable way), one obligates when it is unlike the normal Avodah (the idolatry is normally served through disgrace), and one is Mechalek the Avodos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LIABILITY FOR ACCEPTANCE OF IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he accepts it as a god, if he says 'you are my god' (he is liable).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Once he says 'you are my god,' he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which liability does Rav Nachman teach about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He need not teach that he is Chayav Misah. Our Mishnah teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that he must bring a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this even according to Chachamim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One is liable (to bring a Korban) only for an action, such as slaughtering, burning, Nisuch, or bowing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The Beraisa obligates for bowing. It is like R. Akiva, who does not require a (big) action.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Nachman teaches according to R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. R. Akiva (Kerisus 7b) holds that Megadef (refers to blasphemy, and he) brings a Korban even though he did no action!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that R. Akiva obligates only for Megadef, regarding which the Torah wrote Kares (in the Parshah of Korban), but not for accepting idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nachman teaches that this is not so, for the Torah equates them (accepting idolatry and serving through an action) - "va'Yishtachavu Lo va'Yizbechu Lo (va'Yomru Eleh Elokecha Yisrael)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> (In the Parshah of the Egel, it says "Eleh Elokecha Yisrael Asher <i>He'elucha</i> (plural)", connoting that the Egel was one of the Powers that redeemed us, i.e. with Hash-m;) had they said 'Ha'alcha' (singular, i.e. it alone redeemed us), Bnei Yisrael would have been worthy to be destroyed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Tana'im argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Others):</span> Had they said 'Ha'alcha' instead of "He'elucha", Bnei Yisrael would have been worthy to be destroyed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Shimon):</span> Anyone who says that Hash-m has a partner, he is uprooted from the world (this is worse than denying Hash-m)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, "He'elucha" teaches that they desired to worship many gods.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LAVIM OF IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are forbidden by a Lav - hugging and kissing, sweeping or spraying...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing R. Elazar):</span> One is lashed for any of these, except for vowing or swearing in the name of idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> One is not lashed for these because they are Lavin she'Ein Bahem Ma'aseh (they do not involve an action);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One should not be lashed for the others either. They are Lavim shebi'Chlalos (different transgressions forbidden by one Lav). One is not lashed for such Lavim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who eats from an animal before it dies transgresses a Lav, "Lo Sochlu Al ha'Dam";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also, this forbids eating a Korban before the blood is thrown on the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Dosa says, this teaches that we are not Mavreh (serve to mourners the first meal after the burial) for people killed by Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Akiva says, this teaches that Beis Din does not eat on the day they kill someone.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is the warning not to become a Ben Sorer u'Moreh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin bar Chiya):</span> One is not lashed for any of these because they are Lavim shebi'Chlalos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin citing R. Elazar):</span> One is not lashed for the Lavim listed in the Mishnah (hugging and kissing...), except for vowing or swearing in the name of idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> One is not lashed for the others because they are Lavim shebi'Chlalos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One should not be lashed for vowing and swearing either, for they are Lavim she'Ein Bahem Ma'aseh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ravin's law is according to R. Yehudah, who says that one is lashed for a Lav she'Ein Bo Ma'aseh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Lo Sosiru... (veha'Nosar... ba'Esh Tisrofu)" - the verse gives an Aseh to fix the Lav, therefore one is not lashed for it.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov):</span> No, one is not lashed because it is Lav she'Ein Bo Ma'aseh. One is not lashed for such Lavim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Yehudah holds that one is lashed for such Lavim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Lav forbids vowing or swearing in the name of idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of these?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "V'Shem Elohim Acherim Lo Sazkiru" - do not say ''wait for me by idol Plonis';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lo Yishma Al Picha" - do not vow or swear in the name of idolatry, and do not cause others to do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Alternatively, this is a warning not to entice (an individual) or be Medi'ach (entice a multitude).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> "V'Chol Yisrael Yishme'u v'Yira'un" warns not to entice!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, alternatively, this is a warning not to Medi'ach.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MENTIONING IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Beraisa forbids causing others to vow or swear in the name of idolatry. This supports Shmuel's father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel's father):</span> One may not make a partnership with a Nochri, lest the Nochri need to swear, and he will swear in the name of idolatry, and the Yisrael transgresses "Lo Yishma Al Picha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rava (to Ula):</span> Where did you lodge?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> I lodged in Kalnevo (a city named for its idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> it says "v'Shem Elohim Acherim Lo Sazkiru"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> R. Yochanan taught that one may mention any idolatry mentioned in the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where is Kalnevo mentioned?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kara Bel Kores Nevo" (Kalnevo is a derogatory form of Nevo).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it was not mentioned in the Torah, it would be forbidden to mention it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mesharshiya - Mishnah):</span> If a man had an emission (of Zivah) that endured as long as three emissions, i.e. the time needed to walk from Gadiyon (an idolatry) to Shilo, which is the time to immerse and dry oneself twice, he is a full Zav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Gad (for which Gadiyon is named) is mentioned in the Torah - "ha'Orchim la'Gad Shulchan."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>RIDICULING IDOLS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> All scoffery is forbidden, except for ridiculing idolatry - "Kara Bel Kores Nevo...Lo Yachlu Malet Masa (the idols could not hold in their excrement) ...u'Chmarav Alav Yagilu Al <i>Kevodo</i>", we read this 'Keveido' (its priests rejoiced that the idols with their feces were taken away).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak):</span> What does it mean "va'Ya'asu Lahem Masechah Kisvunim Atzabim"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that everyone had an image of his idolatry in his pocket, when he would mention it, he would take i	t out and hug and kiss it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Zovchei Adam Agalim Yishakun"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak d'Vei R. Ami):</span> The priests of idolatry schemed to get money from rich people;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They would starve a calf (of idolatry), and put images of a rich person by the feeding trough. When the calf would see the person, it would run to it (hoping for food). The priest would say 'this shows that it wants you to sacrifice yourself to it' (and the priests would take his money).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, it should say 'Yishakun Lizvo'ach Adam' (the priests say 'it kisses you because it wants you to sacrifice yourself). "Zovchei Adam Agalim Yishakun" connotes that they kiss one who already sacrificed a person!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, it teaches that if someone slaughtered his son to idolatry, they would say 'you offered a great Korban. Now you may kiss the idol.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "V'Anshei Vavel Asu Es Sukos Benos" - this (idol) was a hen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Anshei Kush Asu Es Nergal" was a rooster. "V'Anshei Chamas Asu Es Ashima" was a goat. "Veha'Avim Asu Nivchaz v'Es Tartak" were a dog and a donkey. "Veha'Sefarvim Sorefim Es Bneihem l'Adramelech va'Anamelech" were a mule and a horse.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>'Adramelech' is a mule, which is Mehadar (honors) its Melech (master, it carries his burden);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>'Anamelech' is a horse, which is Oneh (answers) its master's needs in war.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Achaz wanted to burn his son Chizkiyah in the fire to idolatry, but Chizkiyah's mother had anointed him with blood of the Salmandra (a certain Chayah, which made him invulnerable to fire).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Yisrael knew that idolatry does nothing. They served in order to cast off the yoke of Torah and publicly indulge in their true lust, Arayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> "Ki'Zchor Bneihem Mizbechosaa m";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> This is like a man who longs for his son (they really wanted to serve)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After they were steeped in it, they felt attached to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "V'Nosati Es Pigreichem Al Pigrei Giluleichem" - Eliyahu was walking among the starved, swollen bellied people in Yerushalayim (at the time of the Churban). Once, he saw a boy in a wasteheap. The boy told him that he was the last remnant of his family.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> Do you want to learn something that will give to you life? Every day, say "Shema Yisrael Hash-m Elokeinu Hash-m Echad"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The boy:</span> I refuse to mention the name of Hash-m, for my parents did not teach it to me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The boy took out his idol, hugged and kissed it until his stomach burst. The idol fell to the ground, and he fell on it, fulfilling "v'Nosati Es Pigreichem Al Pigrei Giluleichem."</p>
