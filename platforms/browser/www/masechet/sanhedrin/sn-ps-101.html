<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ENTIRE LIFE OF AN <i>ONI</i> IS DIFFICULT (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> "Kol Yemei Oni Ra'im" is an irritable person;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Tov Lev Mishteh Samid" is one who is easygoing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Why does it say "Kol Yemei Oni Ra'im"? He eats well on Shabbos and Yom Tov (we distribute Tzedakah to the poor then)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even Shabbos and Yom Tov are bad for him, as Shmuel taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A change from one's normal diet prompts (intestinal) sickness.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>RESPECT FOR TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one reads a verse of Shir ha'Shirim as if it were a song (Rashi - unlike the proper cantillation), or reads verses in the pub out of place (just for fun), he brings evil to the world;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah girds itself in sackcloth and complains to Hash-m 'Yisrael treat me like a harp for scoffers to play'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> When Yisrael eat and drink, in what should they engage?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The Torah:</span> Each should engage in what he learns. One who learns Mikra (Torah, Nevi'im and Kesuvim) should learn Mikra. One who learns Mishnah should learn Mishnah, Halachos and Agados. One who learns Talmud should learn what is relevant to the season, e.g. laws of each festival on that festival.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, if one reads a verse in the proper time, he brings good to the world - "v'Davar b'Ito Mah Tov."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who whispers on a wound (has no share in the world to come).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is when he spits, for we do not say Hash-m's name after spitting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Even if he said "Nega Tzara'as..." (which discusses healing, but does not include Hash-m's name) he has no share.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> If he said any verse, even "va'Yikra El Moshe..." (which does not discuss healing, he hopes that the merit of learning Torah will cure him) he has no share.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SICKNESSES AND CURES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may anoint and massage the intestines on Shabbos. We may whisper charms to snakes and scorpions (so they will not bite), and we may pass a Keli over the eye on Shabbos to cool it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, a Muktzeh Keli (which may not be moved on Shabbos) may not be used.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We may not ask Shedim (e.g. to find lost objects) on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi says, this is always forbidden (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah does [not - Gra deletes this from the text] follow R. Yosi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi forbids only due to danger.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yitzchak bar Yosef asked something from a Shed. It made a tree swallow him (to harm him). Hash-m miraculously saved him by splitting the tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may anoint and massage the intestines on Shabbos; as long as it is not done the same way as on a weekday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How should one deviate?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> First anoint, and then massage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> Anoint and massage at the same time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may ask Shedim via oil or egg shells, (Rashi - but it is not advisable; some texts - this is) because they lie;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>People who use Shedim whisper on oil in a Keli, but not on oil in the hand. Therefore, one may anoint with oil in the hand, but not with oil from a Keli (lest Shedim engaged with it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yitzchak bar Shmuel bar Marsa stayed at an inn. They brought him oil in a Keli. He anointed with it. Boils started sprouting on his face. He went outside. A woman saw him, recognized the Shed responsible for the boils, and cured him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba):</span> It says "Kol ha'Machalah... Lo Asim Alecha Ki Ani Hash-m Rof'echa." If He will not send sicknesses, why does it say that He heals us?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Mari):</span> "Im Shamo'a Tishma l'Kol Hash-m" - if we will heed Him, He will not send sicknesses. If not, He will send, but even so, He will heal us.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> When R. Eliezer fell sick, his Talmidim came to see him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> There is a fierce anger in the world!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They cried, and R. Akiva laughed. They asked him why he was laughing. He asked why they are crying.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The others:</span> R. Eliezer is a living Sefer Torah, and he is in pain. We must cry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> That is why I laugh! I saw that his wine never sours, his flax is never stricken, and his oil and honey never spoil. I was worried lest, Heaven forbid, he received his reward in this world!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Now that I see him in pain, I am sure that his reward awaits him in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Is there any Mitzvah that I did not fulfill (that you consider me worthy of suffering)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> You taught us "Adam Ein Tzadik ba'Aretz... v'Lo Yecheta." (Gra YD 242:59 - one who says a teaching in front of his Rebbi attributes it to his Rebbi, even if he did not learn it from him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When R. Eliezer fell sick, four Chachamim came to see him:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> You are better for Yisrael than rain. Rain helps us only in this world, but you help us in both worlds!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> You are better for Yisrael than the sun. The sun helps us only in this world, but you help us in both worlds!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar ben Azaryah:</span> You are better for Yisrael than parents. Parents help a person only in this world, but you help us in both worlds!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Afflictions are very precious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Eliezer):</span> How do you know this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Akiva):</span> It says "Menasheh... va'Ya'as ha'Ra b'Einei Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">101b----------------------------------------101b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it possible that Chizkiyah did not teach Torah to his son Menasheh?! He taught the entire world - "...Mishlei Shlomo Asher Hetiku Anshei Chizkiyah..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, all his toil to teach his son did not help to improve his son. Only afflictions helped - "va'Ydaber Hash-m El Menasheh v'El Amo v'Lo Hikshivu va'Yavei Hash-m Aleihem... l'Melech Ashur..."</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>This teaches that afflictions are very precious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three people (thought that they) had irrefutable claims - Kayin, Esav and Menasheh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kayin said "Gadol Avoni mi'Nso." He asked Hash-m, is my sin greater than 600,000 that will later sin against You (with the Egel), and You will forgive them?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Esav said "ha'Vrachah Achas Lecha Avi"?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Menasheh first served idols, and later he turned to Hash-m. He said 'surely, You will help me more than the idols!'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE WHO PRONOUNCES HASH-M'S NAME LIKE IT IS WRITTEN.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Aba Sha'ul):</span> Even one who pronounces Hash-m's name like it is written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This refers to outside the Mikdash, amidst secular discussion (alternatively - in a foreign language).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>YARAV'AM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Three kings and four commoners...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (He is called) Yarav'am because he was Riba Am (lowered the nation);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, he made Merivah (quarrels) among Yisrael (about serving idolatry). Alternatively, he made Merivah between Yisrael and Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ben Nevat - he was the son of he who Hibit (saw), but did not understand (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Nevat is Michah. He is (also) Sheva ben Bichri;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is called Nevat because he saw, but did not understand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He is called Michah because he was Nismachmech (being crushed) in the building in Miztrayim (and Hash-m acceded to Moshe's prayer to save him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>His real name was Sheva ben Bichri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three people misunderstood what they saw - Nevat, Achitofel and Paro's astrologers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nevat saw (Ramah - in a dream) a fire coming out of his Ever (a sign of power). He thought that it applies to himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Really, the sign hinted that (one who will come from his Ever, i.e.) his son Yarav'am will be king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Achitofel saw Tzara'as on his Ever. He thought that he will reign;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Really, it hinted that his great grandson Shlomo will rule.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Why does it say "<i>Hemah</i> Mei Merivah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is the water that Paro's astrologers saw. They saw that the savior of Yisrael would be stricken through water, therefore they decreed "Kol ha'Ben ha'Yilud ha'Y'orah Tashlichuhu";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They did not understand that he would be stricken due to Mei Merivah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Yarav'am has no share in the world to come?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "...Beis Yarav'am <i>u'Lehachchid u'Lehashmid</i> me'Al Penei ha'Adamah" - to be destroyed in this world, and to be desolate in the world to come.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is because he rebuked Shlomo.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was he punished?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is because he rebuked him in public - "Shlomo... Sogar Es Peretz Ir David":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Yarav'am:</span> David breached the wall to make it easier for Yisrael to come to Yerushalayim on the festivals. You closed the openings for the sake of (collecting taxes for, or so people will serve) your wife, Bas Paro!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Asher Herim Yad ba'Melech Shlomo"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> He removed his Tefilin in front of Shlomo (baring his head; alternatively, in order to attack him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Yarav'am lost (both) worlds due to haughtiness - "va'Yomer Yarav'am b'Libo..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He knew the tradition that only kings of Yehudah may sit in the Mikdash. He thought that when people see Rechav'am sitting and me standing, they will think that he is king and I am a slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If I will sit, I will be Mored b'Malchus. They will kill me and serve him.'</p>
