<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>NACHUM ISH GAM ZU</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Nachum Ish Gam Zu would always say Gam Zu l'Tovah (also this is for the good), no matter what happened. Once, Yisrael wanted to send a gift of gems to the Kaiser. They decided to send it with Nachum, for miracles often happen for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He lodged at an inn. When asked, he said that he was taking a gift to the Kaiser. At night, they opened his chest, replaced the gems with dirt, and sealed it. When the Kaiser received the chest and found dirt inside, he said 'the Yisraelim are mocking me!' They took Nachum to be killed. He said 'Gam Zu l'Tovah.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Eliyahu appeared like a Roman, and suggested that perhaps this is the dirt that turned into swords when Avraham threw it. They tried this, and found it to be true. They used the dirt to conquer a city they had never been able to conquer. They let Nachum into their treasure house, and told him to take whatever he wants. He filled his chest with gold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>On the way back, the people at the inn asked what happened; he told them. They took more dirt and brought it to Kaiser, and said that this is the dirt that turns into arrows. (They tested this, and it did not work.) He killed them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOR HA'FLAGAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Dor ha'Flagah has no share in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did they do?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (d'Vei R. Shila):</span> They wanted to build a tower up to Shamayim to strike it with axes in order that the water will come down.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael laughed at this:</span> If so, they should have built on a mountain, and not in a valley!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmeyah bar Elazar):</span> There were three factions. One wanted to live in Shamayim. Hash-m scattered them over the world;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One wanted to serve idolatry. "Sham Balal Hash-m Sefas Kol ha'Aretz (He made them speak different languages)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One wanted to wage war against Hash-m, he turned them into monkeys, Ruchos (spirits), Shedim and Lilin (human forms with wings).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa - R. Noson):</span> All of them intended for idolatry. It says "Na'aseh Lanu <i>Shem</i>", similar to "<i>v'Shem</i> Elohim Acherim Lo Sazkiru."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A third of the tower was burned, a third was swallowed into the ground, and a third remains.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The area around the tower (from which it can be seen) causes one to forget.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Bavel and Borsif are (both close to the tower, therefore they are) bad omens for Torah. (Tosfos Shabbos 36b DH Nafka says that there is no city Bavel. The name is used only for the entire region. The Rashash says that Gitin (Sof 65a) connotes otherwise. Margoliyos ha'Yam suggests that our Gemara refers to Borsif of Bavel, or it says 'Bavel' because the name Borsif was changed to 'Bavel'.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> The word Borsif means a pit emptied of its water (a sign of forgetting Torah).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE PEOPLE OF SEDOM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The people of Sedom have no share in the world to come...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The people of Sedom have no share in the world to come. They were "Ra'im" in this world, and "Chata'im" in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> They were "Ra'im" with their bodies - "Eich E'eseh ha'Ra'ah ha'Gedolah ha'Zos (adultery)",</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They were "Chata'im" with their money - "v'Hayah Becha Chet (if you do not lend)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"La'Shem" shows that they blasphemed. "Me'od" - they recognized Hash-m and intended to anger Him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They were "Ra'im" with their money - "v'Ra'ah Eincha b'Achicha ha'Evyon (not to give Tzedakah)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They were "Chata'im" with their bodies - "v'Chotasi l'Eilokim (adultery)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"La'Shem" teaches that they blasphemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Me'od" teaches that they murdered - "Dam Naki Shofach Menasheh Harbeh Me'od."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Dor ha'Mabul became haughty because Hash-m bestowed good on them. "Eretz Mimena Yetzei Lachem... Mekom Sapir Avaneha v'Afros Zahav Lo..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The residents:</span> Our land yields bread and gold. We should not allow travelers, lest they detract from our wealth!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We will stop people from passing through - "...ha'Nishkachim Mini Ragel."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Tehosesu Al Ish... k'Kir Natuy" - they would see a rich person, sit him near a leaning wall and topple it on him, and take his money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Chasar ba'Choshech Batim" - they would deposit Afarsimon (sap of balsam) with a rich person. He would hide it with his valuables. At night they would track down the smell like dogs, to take his valuables - "Yashuvu la'Erev Yehemu cha'Kelev."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>"Arum Yalinu mi'Bli Lavush.... Chamor Yesomim Yinhagu Yachbelu Shor Almanah Gevulos Yasigu... v'Hu li'Kvaros Yuval."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Yosi expounded how the Sodomites tunneled into houses; that night, 300 houses were tunneled into (as the Sodomites did) in the city (Tzipori).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The victims:</span> You taught the thieves!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> I did not know that thieves would come (alternatively - that there are thieves among you)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When R. Yosi died, blood poured from the gutterpipes of Tzipori. (Ben Yehoyada - this showed how bitterly they cried over his loss. Alternatively, it rained, and the water miraculously turned red to show honor to him. Iyun Yakov - there were many murders, to show that his merit had protected his city during his lifetime. He had expounded because he expected his merit to prevent thieves.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The following are laws of Sedom. One with one ox must graze the animals of the city for one day. One with no oxen must graze them for two days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An orphan, the son of a widow, had no oxen. People gave to him oxen to graze. He killed the oxen, and told them 'one who had one ox may take one skin from the carcasses. One who had no oxen may take two, just like the law of grazing!'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">109b----------------------------------------109b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>One who crosses the river where it is narrow and swift (Rashi; Ramah - crosses the bridge) must pay one Zuz. One who walks around it (Ramah - goes through the water) must pay two Zuzim (Ramah - because he deposits some water from the river on the ground; Margoliyus ha'Yam - for trying to evade the tax, and endangering himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If someone made bricks, or spread out garlic or onions to dry, everyone would take one. The owner could not force them to return them (Ramah - because each was worth less than a Perutah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>There were four judges in Sedom. Their names alluded to falsity and unfair judgment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Tom hit Harry's wife and made her miscarry, Harry must give to her to Tom until she because pregnant again;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Tom cut off the ear of Harry's donkey, Harry must give it to Tom until the ear grows back.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Tom wounded Harry, Harry must pay him, for this was (a limited) bloodletting;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One who crosses the river in the ferry (Ramah - bridge) must pay four Zuzim. One who goes through the water must pay eight.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>A launderer once went to Sedom. They demanded four Zuzim from him. When he said that he went through the water, they demanded eight. He did not pay. They wounded him. He came in front of a judge. He was told to pay for the bloodletting, and also the eight Zuzim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Avraham's slave Eliezer once went to Sedom. Someone wounded him. A judge told him to pay for the bloodletting.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Eliezer wounded the judge with a stick (or rock), and said 'what you owe me, pay to the one who wounded me, and I will keep my money.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>They had a bed for guests. If the guest was too tall, they would cut him to fit the bed. If he guest was too short, they would stretch him to fit it. They told Eliezer to sleep on the bed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Eliezer:</span> The day my mother died, I vowed not to sleep on a bed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>When a poor person came, everyone would write his name on a Dinar and give it to him, but no one would give (or even sell) to him food. When he died of hunger, everyone would take back his Dinar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>They stipulated that if someone (Tom) invites a visitor to a wedding, Tom's garment will be confiscated.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They had a wedding. Avraham's slave Eliezer went. No one gave to him bread. He sat at the end. When they asked who had invited him, he said 'this one (next to me).' The man feared lest he lose his garment, and fled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Eliezer did the same for the next man (in front of the one who fled), and so on, until all of them fled. Eliezer enjoyed the meal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>A girl used to put bread in her jug and (when she went to draw water) would inconspicuously give it to a poor person. When people found out, they coated her with honey, and put her on top of the wall. Bees consumed her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Za'akas Sedom va'Amora Ki Rabah" - we read this like 'Rivah' (Hash-m decided to destroy Sedom due to the girl).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "<i>Va'Yikach</i> Korach" - he made a bad purchase (to quarrel with Moshe);</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'Ben Yitzhar' - he aroused the world's anger on himself (Maharsha - on Yisrael) as hot as Tzaharim (noon);</p>
