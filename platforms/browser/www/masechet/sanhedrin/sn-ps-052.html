<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>R. YISHMAEL'S OPINION (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yishmael expound "Es Aviha Hi Mechaleles"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "Es Aviha Hi Mechaleles" teaches that we no longer treat her father honorably (like other Kohanim):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we used to treat him like someone Kodesh, we treat him like Chulin. If we used honor him, we disgrace him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We say 'cursed is the one who fathered such a girl, who raised such a girl.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Even if a Rasha's father is a Tzadik, we call him a Rasha ben Rasha. This is like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This is the Mitzvah of stoning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say 'this is the Mitzvah of stoning?' (The Mishnah listed all the Misos!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The previous Perek taught that after the final verdict, he is taken to be stoned. Beis ha'Skilah was twice one's height;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since we will next teach about burning, our Mishnah concluded 'this is the Mitzvah of stoning.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE MITZVAH OF BURNING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> For the Mitzvah of burning, we insert him in manure up to his knees. We put a hard garment inside a soft garment, and wrap them around his neck. The witnesses pull in both directions, making his mouth open. One lights a Pesilah (this usually means a wick) and throws it into his mouth. This burns his innards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, perhaps they will strangle him, and the Mitzvah will not be fulfilled!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we use tongs to force his mouth open, and throw in the Pesilah as above.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok says, a case occurred in which a Bas Kohen was Mezanah. They surrounded her with bundles of twigs and burned her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> This was incorrect. The Beis Din was not learned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is 'Pesilah'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Masnah):</span> It is (molten) lead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn a Gezerah Shavah "Sereifah-Sereifah" from Korach's congregation. Just like there the Neshamah was burned, but not the body (this will be explained), also (Misas) Sereifah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> We learn a Gezerah Shavah "Sereifah-Sereifah" from Nadav and Avihu. Just like there the Neshamah was burned, and not the body (this will be explained), also Sereifah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the first opinion know that in Korach's congregation only the Neshamah was burned, and not the body?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Es Machtos ha'Chata'im Ha'elu b'Nafshosam" - their Neshamos were burned, and not their bodies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar says, a regular fire consumed them (with their bodies);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Ha'Chata'im Ha'elu <i>b</i>'Nafshosam" teaches that they were burned <i>due to</i> their Neshamos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "B'Chanfei La'agei Ma'og Charok Alai Shineimo" - due to flattery of food (Korach gave food and drink to people, therefore they supported him), the minister of Gehinom gnashed his teeth at them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Elazar know that only the Neshamos of Nadav and Avihu were burned, but not their bodies?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Yamusu" - it was like (regular) death (their bodies remained intact).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first opinion holds that a regular fire consumed them. "Va'Yamusu" teaches that the fire started form their insides, like (regular) death (which results from something internal).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Yosi ben Dosta'i):</span> Two strings of fire came from the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim. Each split into two and entered the nostrils of one of them and killed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (against the first opinion):</span> It says "va'Tochal <i>Osam</i>"! (If fire consumed them, what is excluded?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It consumed them, but not their garments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn from bulls (whose blood is sprinkled in the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim) that are burned? They are truly burned!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to learn from people (Korach's congregation or Nadav and Avihu). They resemble Sereifah of Misas Beis Din in these ways:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They pertain to people, they pertain to sinners, Neshamos are taken, and Pigul does not apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rather, we should learn from bulls. They are burned according to Halachah, and they apply to all generations!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are more similarities to people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the first opinion learn from Nadav and Avihu?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that they were truly burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let us learn from them that indeed, we truly burn people!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> "V'Ohavta l'Re'acha Kamocha" - choose a nice death for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we learn from there, why do we need the Gezerah Shavah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that if only the Neshamah is burned but not the body, this is not considered burning. The Gezerah Shavah teaches that it is.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One could fulfill "v'Ohavta l'Re'acha Kamocha" by making a great fire that will burn the person very quickly.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>NADAV AND AVIHU</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Moshe and Aharon were walking. Nadav and Avihu were in back of them, and all of Yisrael were in back of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Nadav (to Avihu):</span> When will these elders (Moshe and Aharon) die? Then, we will lead the generation!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> We shall see who will die first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is like people say 'many old camels carry the skins of young camels' (that died because they were not trained to bear a burden).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> At first, an ignoramus sees a Chacham like a golden flask;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After the Chacham talks with him (about secular matters), the Chacham appears like a silver flask;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>After the Chacham benefits from him, he appears like a broken earthenware flask, which cannot be fixed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A certain Bas Kohen was Mezanah. Rav Chama bar Tuvya burned her in a fire of sticks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> He made two mistakes. He erred about Rav Masnah's teaching (that the Pesilah for Sereifah is molten lead), and about a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "U'Vosa El ha'Kohanim ha'Leviyim v'El ha'Shofet Asher Yihyeh ba'Yomim ha'Hem" - we judge capital cases only at a time when there are (Shoftim, i.e. the Sanhedrin in Lishkas ha'Gazis, near the) Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok):</span> A case occurred in which a Bas Kohen was Mezanah... (they truly burned her. Chachamim said, the Beis Din was not learned.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> It was a Beis Din of Tzedukim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was this really Chachamim's rebuttal of R. Eliezer?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok):</span> I remember when I was a boy on my father's shoulder, that a Bas Kohen was Mezanah. They surrounded her with bundles of twigs and burned her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We do not bring proof from (something witnessed by) a minor (even after he matures).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He saw this on two occasions. (Chachamim rejected his two testimonies for different reasons.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which did he testify about first?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he first testified about the one he saw in adulthood (and Chachamim said that the Beis Din was not learned), he would not bother to testify later about what he saw as a child!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He first testified about what he saw when he was a child. Chachamim said that we do not bring proof from a minor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He saw another case when he was an adult, and 3sChachamim said that the Beis Din was not learned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>BEHEADING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beheading - they behead him (from a standing position) like kingdoms do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> That is disgraceful! Rather, we rest his head on a block and cut it with a chopping knife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> That is the most disgraceful death!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> I agree that this is disgraceful, but we cannot kill like the kingdom - "uv'Chukoseihem Lo Selechu"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Since the Torah teaches that a sword should be used, we did not learn from the Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, anything learned from Torah is not forbidden due to "uv'Chukoseihem Lo Selechu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We burn after a king dies. This is not forbidden due to 'Darchei ha'Emori' (doing like the Kena'anim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This should be forbidden due to "uv'Chukoseihem Lo Selechu"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we learn from Torah, "uv'Misrefos Avosecha...", it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are beheaded: a murderer and people of an Ir ha'Nidachas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Ir ha'Nidachas, it explicitly says "l'Fi Charev";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a murderer is beheaded by a sword?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Nakom Yinakem" does not specify which Misah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, it says "Cherev Nokemes Nekam Bris" to teach that it refers to a sword.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we stab with a sword!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "l'<i>Fi</i> Charev" (the edge of a sword, and not the point).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we cut the person lengthwise!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> "V'Ohavta l'Re'acha Kamocha" - choose a nice death for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Nakom Yinakem" refers to one who killed a slave. What is the source that one who killed a Yisrael is beheaded? (There, it says "Yumas", which refers to choking.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from a Kal va'Chomer. One who killed a slave is beheaded, and all the more so one who killed a Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that beheading is more severe than choking. like the opinion that choking is more severe, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> "V'Atah Teva'er ha'Dam ha'Naki mi'Kirbecha" - murderers (about whom it similarly says "u'Bi'arta ha'Ra mi'Kirbecha") are equated to Eglah Arufah, which is killed by a knife through the neck.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we learn from Eglah Arufah, we should use a chopping knife and cut from the back of the neck!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> "V'Ohavta l'Re'acha Kamocha" - choose a nice death for him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>CHOKING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Mitzvah of choking: we insert him in manure up to his knees, we put a hard garment inside a soft garment, and wrap them around his neck. The witnesses pull in both directions, until he dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Ish (a man who transgresses adultery)" excludes a minor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Asher Yin'af Es Eshes Ish" excludes a minor's wife (i.e. a minor cannot Mekadesh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Eshes Re'ehu" excludes a Nochri's wife (a Nochri cannot be Mekadesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Mos Yumas" - he is choked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this refers to a different Misah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yoshiyah):</span> Whenever the Torah does not specify which Misah, we give the lightest (choking).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yonason):</span> Unspecified Misah refers to choking, even though it is not the lightest (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> He learns from Misah bi'Ydei Shamayim (which is also unspecified);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like Misah bi'Ydei Shamayim (Aruch - natural death; Rashi - Onan's death) is not noticeable on the body, also Misas Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to burning, which does not mar the body!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Torah says that a Bas Kohen is burned for Zenus, this implies that a Bas Yisrael (about whom it says "Mos Yumas") is not burned.</p>
