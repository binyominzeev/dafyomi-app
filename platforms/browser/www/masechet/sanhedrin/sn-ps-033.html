<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN CAN WE OVERTURN A VERDICT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> A monetary verdict can be overturned, whether Zechus or Chiyuv:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #2):</span> If a judge judged and acquitted the guilty or obligated the innocent, or he declared Tamei what is Tahor or declared Tahor what is Tamei, what he did stands. He must pay for the loss that he caused.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> Mishnah #1 refers to a Mumcheh (if he retracts, we are confident that now he is correct). Mishnah #2 discusses a judge who is not Mumcheh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we really overturn the verdict of a Mumcheh?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Mumcheh l'Rabim is exempt (if he erred). (If he can overturn his verdict, there is nothing to pay for!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> A bigger Chacham can overturn the verdict. If there is no bigger Chacham, the verdict stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> If he was To'eh bi'Dvar Mishnah (made a clear mistake), we overturn the verdict. If he was To'eh b'Shikul ha'Da'as (ruled unlike the primary opinion), the verdict stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If he erred in (a Tosefta of) R. Chiya and R. Oshaya, is this considered To'eh bi'Dvar Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Is a mistake about a teaching of Rav and Shmuel included (in To'eh bi'Dvar Mishnah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Is a mistake about one of our teachings included?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Are we loafers?! (Also this is To'eh bi'Dvar Mishnah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is To'eh b'Shikul ha'Da'as?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Two Tana'im or Amora'im argue with each other, and the Halachah was not fixed like either one, but the discussion favors one (and the judge ruled like the other opinion).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Sheshes - Rav Hamnuna - Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in which the womb of a cow was removed. R. Tarfon ruled that it is Treifah, and they fed it to dogs;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim in Yavneh said that it is Kosher, for they cut the wombs of all cows and pigs that leave Miztrayim (so they will not reproduce, but they live).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> I will lose my donkey due to my mistake!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> You are Mumcheh l'Rabim; you are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If we overturn a Ta'us bi'Dvar Mishnah, that is enough to exempt R. Tarfon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, R. Akiva gave a second reason to exempt him:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since you were To'eh bi'Dvar Mishnah, we overturn the verdict, and you are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Even if you were To'eh b'Shikul ha'Da'as, since you are a Mumcheh l'Rabim, you would be exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> How could Rav Hamnuna ask from that case. R. Tarfon fed it to dogs, it would not help to overturn the verdict!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">15.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If regarding To'eh bi'Dvar Mishnah the verdict stands, we understand why R. Tarfon thought that he would be liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, if To'eh bi'Dvar Mishnah can be overturned, why did he expect to be liable? Since if the cow was around his ruling has no effect, even if it is not around, his ruling should have no effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> If the judge himself transferred the money, the verdict stands. If he did not, we overturn the verdict.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That explains (in Mishnah #2) 'if he obligated the innocent';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding 'he acquitted the guilty' he said 'you are exempt.' He did not transfer money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Saying 'you are exempt' is like bodily transferring the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah #1):</span> A monetary verdict can be overturned, whether Zechus or Chiyuv:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We understand Chiyuv. Originally, he said 'you are liable' and did not transfer the money himself, and later he retracted;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>However, if saying 'you are exempt' is like bodily transferring the money, this can never be retracted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mishnah #1 means that a monetary verdict of Chiyuv can be overturned, even though this is Zechus for the other party (but a verdict of 'exempt' cannot be overturned).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Mishnah says that in capital cases we can overturn a verdict of Chiyuv, but not of Zechus. I.e., we can change to Zechus only if it does not harm anyone else (e.g. Ploni was sentenced for Chilul Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who could be harmed if Ploni is exempted?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (In a murder case,) the Go'el ha'Dam (the relative of the victim) is harmed (he hoped to avenge the murder).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Will we kill Ploni due to (not wanting to retract, lest this upset) the Go'el ha'Dam?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> The Mishnah says that a monetary verdict can be overturned, <i>whether</i> Zechus <i>or</i> Chiyuv!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>These questions are left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (e) - Ravina):</span> Almoni had a security of Ploni. When the judge exempted Ploni, he took the security and gave it to Ploni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>'He declared Tamei what is Tahor' can also be through the judge's action. He touched a Sheretz to it to 'prove' that it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding 'he declared Tahor what is Tamei', the judge mixed it with other Taharos of Ploni to 'prove' that it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHANGING THE VERDICT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In capital cases (we can overturn a verdict of Chiyuv, but not of Zechus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that if Beis Din sentenced Ploni to die, and someone had a reason for Zechus, that we return him and reconsider the verdict?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Naki (v'Tzadik) Al Taharog."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if Beis Din acquitted Ploni, and someone had a reason for Chiyuv, that we do not reconsider the verdict?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Tzadik Al Taharog."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> The opposite applies to a Mesis (we return to convict, but not to acquit) - "v'Lo Sachmol v'Lo Sechaseh Alav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> We learn from "Ki Harog Tahargenu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> What is the source that the same applies to someone sentenced or exempted from Galus (for killing unintentionally, and we overturn only a verdict of Chiyuv)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Rotze'ach-Rotze'ach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> What is the source for (conviction or exemption from) lashes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Rasha-Rasha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> We learn Chayavei Galuyos from "Rotze'ach-Rotze'ach." We learn Chayavei Malkos from "Rasha-Rasha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not overturn a verdict of Zechus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> This refers to a mistake about something that the Tzedukim (who reject our Oral tradition) do not agree to. Something that even they agree to is a blatant error, and we overturn it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If they exempted adulterers, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> You can answer that from what you already know. (Tzedukim admit to this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If they exempted adulterers, we overturn this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a case (of adultery) that we do not overturn? (The Mishnah said that in capital cases, we do not overturn a verdict of Zechus, without specifying. This implies that this applies (at least sometimes) to every capital transgression.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They exempted them for abnormal Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ARGUING FOR ZECHUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In monetary cases, anyone can give a reason for Zechus or Chiyuv...  (in capital cases, anyone can give a reason for Zechus, but not everyone can give a reason for Chiyuv).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> <i>Anyone</i> includes the witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, and unlike Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Ed Echad Lo Ya'aneh v'Nefesh" - a witness in a capital case cannot argue (at all, not) for Zechus or Chiyuv.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, he can speak for Zechus, but not for Chiyuv.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> No, <i>anyone</i> includes the Talmidim. All agree to the Mishnah.</p>
