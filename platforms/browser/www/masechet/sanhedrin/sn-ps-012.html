<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHERE AND WHEN WE ARE ME'ABER THE YEAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We are not Me'aber the year in famine years (because people need to eat the new grain as soon as possible).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "V'Ish Ba mi'Ba'al Shalishah va'Yavei... Lechem Bikurim... Se'orim" - the first part of Eretz Yisrael in which the fruits ripen is Ba'al Shalishah, and even so, only one species ripened.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it was wheat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Se'orim".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this was before the Omer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Give to the people and they will eat." (Fresh grain is forbidden before the Omer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> It was proper to be Me'aber the year. Elisha was not Me'aber it because it was a famine year, and everyone needed the new grain immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We Me'aber the year only after Rosh Hashanah. If it was made Me'aber before Rosh Hashanah, it is not Me'uberes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In forced circumstances, we are Me'aber it right after Rosh Hashanah. Still, the only month we add is a second Adar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Once, two Chachamim came from Tiverya. The Persians (some say - rain) detained them, but Hash-m enabled them to pass. They came to inform Rava that the Nasi wanted to add a Netziv (i.e. Me'aber the year), but the Romans did not allow him. Chachamim gathered in the month in which Aharon died (Av) to be Me'aber the following year. (The message was said cryptically, so news of the Ibur would not reach the authorities.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They may decide whether or not to be Me'aber before Rosh Hashanah, but they do not reveal the decision before Rosh Hashanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that 'Netziv' refers to a month?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Veli'Shlomo Shneim Asar Nitzavim... Chodesh ba'Shanah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "u'Netziz Echad Asher ba'Aretz"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah or Rav Nachman):</span> One of them was appointed over all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of Rav Yehudah and Rav Nachman):</span> The extra one was for Chodesh ha'Ibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We are not Me'aber from one year to another (Rashi - to be Me'aber this year due to next year, which should be Me'uberes; Tosfos - we do not consider now if next year should be Me'uberes);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are not Me'aber three years at once (consecutively; alternatively, we do not decide at once to be Me'aber three (non-consecutive) years).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, a case occurred in which R. Akiva was in prison, he was Me'aber three years at once.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No, Beis Din was Me'aber each year in its proper time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We are not Me'aber a Shemitah year (for this prolongs the Isur to work the land), nor the year after Shemitah (for people need the new grain quickly);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is customary to be Me'aber the year before Shemitah (to allow another month of working the land);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Raban Gamliel's house would be Me'aber the year after Shemitah (because people can import Peros).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>These Tana'im argue about whether or not we may import Peros, like the following Tana'im argue;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may not import vegetables from Chutz la'Aretz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Raboseinu permit this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The first Tana forbids lest (Tamei) dirt will come with the vegetables, Raboseinu are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IBUR DUE TO TUM'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We are not Me'aber a year due to Tum'ah (to enable Yisrael to bring Korban Pesach in Taharah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, we are Me'aber the year due to Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> A case occurred in which Chizkiyah ha'Melech was Me'aber the year due to Tum'ah, and prayed that Hash-m should forgive him - "ha'Am... Lo Hiteharu Ki Achelu Es ha'Pesach b'Lo cha'Kasuv Ki Hispalel...Yechaper b'Ad." (The Gemara will ask about this below.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> Had he been Me'aber due to Tum'ah, it would have been proper;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He prayed for forgiveness because we add only a second Adar, and he added a second Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Yehudah says, he prayed for forgiveness because he persuaded Yisrael to bring Korban Pesach on Pesach Sheni (and they should have brought it on Pesach Rishon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> We are Me'aber the year (due to Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that Tum'ah is Dechuyah (Korbanos Tzibur can be brought b'Tum'ah, but we must do as much as possible b'Taharah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> The Tzitz is Meratzeh (makes acceptable Korbanos brought b'Tum'ah) whether or not the Kohen Gadol is wearing it at the time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah says, it is Meratzeh only when he is wearing it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> Yom Kipur proves that it is Meratzeh even when he is not wearing it (he does not wear it for the Avodah in the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim, yet if it was done b'Tum'ah, it is acceptable)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> No, Avodah b'Tum'ah is acceptable because Tum'ah is Hutrah (wholly permitted) b'Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> In any case, R. Yehudah contradicts himself in the Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He said that we are Me'aber the year (due to Tum'ah), and that Chizkiyah did so and prayed for forgiveness!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that the Beraisa is abbreviated. It should say as follows. We are not Me'aber a year due to Tum'ah. If this was done, it is Me'uberes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Yehudah says, it is not Me'uberes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> A case occurred...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>(According to this, Inference (d) is unfounded, so Question (e) is not a question.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Had he been Me'aber due to Tum'ah, it would have been proper.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The way we now explain the Beraisa, this is like the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> No, R. Shimon permits to be Me'aber due to Tum'ah, the first Tana forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> L'Chatchilah one may not be Me'aber due to Tum'ah. R. Shimon permits this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Shimon, why did he pray for forgiveness?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We add only a second Adar, and he added a second Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Didn't Chizkiyah expound "ha'Chodesh ha'Zeh Lachem" - there is no other (e.g. a second) Nisan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He erred about Shmuel's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We may not Me'aber the year on Adar 30, for this day can be made Rosh Chodesh Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chizkiyah thought that this possibility does not matter (as long as it was not made Rosh Chodesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>A Beraisa teaches exactly like Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN IS PESACH BROUGHT B'TUMAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Yehudah):</span> He prayed for forgiveness because he persuaded Yisrael to bring Korban Pesach on Pesach Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> (Slightly more than) half the men in Yisrael were Teme'im, and (almost) half were Tehorim. Most of the women were Tehoros, making the majority of Yisraelim Tehorim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At first, he thought that women are obligated to bring Korban Pesach, therefore the majority of Yisraelim (obligated in Pesach) were Tehorim, so the Teme'im must wait until Pesach Sheni;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Later, he thought that women are not obligated in Pesach, therefore the majority were Teme'im, so they should have brought Pesach (Rishon) b'Tum'ah (therefore, he prayed for forgiveness).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We may not be Me'aber the year on Adar 30, for this day can be made Rosh Chodesh Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it was made Me'uberes on this day, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> We are not Mekadesh the coming Chodesh (i.e. <i>announce</i> that it is Adar Sheni. We do Mekadesh (and announce) the Chodesh after this (Nisan)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they were Mekadesh the Chodesh, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> The year is not Me'uberes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> The year is Me'uberes, and the month is Mekudash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> There are 30 days from Purim until Pesach, during which we teach the laws of Pesach. (Since an Ibur year was not declared before the 14th of Adar, we treated this day like Purim, and started teaching the laws);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We ask about laws of Pesach 30 days before Pesach (even though normally, one may ask only about what is being taught);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, we ask two weeks before Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Since we already started teaching laws of Pesach, when people hear that Pesach was delayed, they will treat the Isur of Chametz lightly!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> People know that Ibur Shanah depends on calculations. They will realize that until now, the calculation did not mandate an Ibur Shanah (so they will not treat Chametz lightly).</p>
