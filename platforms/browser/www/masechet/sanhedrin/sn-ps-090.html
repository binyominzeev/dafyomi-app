<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ARGUMENT ABOUT A FALSE NAVI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> R. Shimon and Chachamim argue about (how we kill) a false Navi who totally uproots (claims that Hash-m permitted) idolatry, or uproots some Isurim of idolatry and leaves others - "Min ha'Derech", even part of His way;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree about every other Mitzvah that if he totally uproots it he is choked, but if he partially uproots it he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Hamnuna - Beraisa):</span> (The above verse continues) "Laleches" refers to an Aseh. "Bah" refers to a Lav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse cannot refer to idolatry. There is no Aseh of idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> There is an Aseh - "v'Nitaztem" (breaking altars for idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> They argue about a false Navi who totally uproots idolatry or any other Mitzvah, or partially uproots idolatry - "Min ha'Derech", even part of His way;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree that if he partially uproots any other Mitzvah he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against both of them - Beraisa):</span> One who prophesizes to (totally) uproot a Mitzvah from the Torah is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says, if he partially uproots it he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding idolatry, even if he says 'serve it today, and abolish it tomorrow' he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (for Rav Chisda - Abaye):</span> The Beraisa means, one who prophesizes to uproot a Mitzvah from the Torah, all agree that he is choked;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says, if he partially uproots it he is exempt. Chachamim agree;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding idolatry, even if he says 'serve it today, and abolish it tomorrow' he is liable. They argue about which Misah (R. Shimon says choking, and Chachamim says stoning);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (for Rav Hamnuna - Rava):</span> It means, one who prophesizes to uproot idolatry or any other Mitzvah is liable. They argue about which Misah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says, if he partially uproots any other Mitzvah, he is exempt. Chachamim agree;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding idolatry, even if he says 'serve it today, and abolish it tomorrow' he is liable. They argue about which Misah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> If an (established) Navi tells you to transgress any Mitzvah (due to Hora'as Sha'ah, a temporary ruling due to an urgent need), obey him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The only exception is idolatry. Even if he causes the sun to stand still, do not obey him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> The Torah warns, even if a false Navi will be able to make the sun stand still (through Kishuf), do not consent to idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> Hash-m would never allow a sinner to make the sun stand still!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the Torah teaches that even if an established true Navi such as Chananyah ben Ozer later sins and prophesizes to serve idolatry, do not listen (even if he previously performed great wonders).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ZOMEMIM OF A BAS KOHEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Edim Zomemim who falsely convicted a Bas Kohen...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika - Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> In all other Chayavei Misos, Edim Zomemim receive the same Misah as the one they framed, and both partners in Bi'ah (if both were Mezid) receive the same Misah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding a Bas Kohen it says "Hi" - she is burned, but the adulterer is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do Zomemim witnesses receive his punishment or hers?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ka'asher Zomam La'asos <i>l'Achiv</i>", and not as he plotted to do to his 'sister' (i.e. the Bas Kohen). (Rashi - this is only when their testimony convicted both of them; Tosfos (51b) - it is even if they convicted only her.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHO HAS A SHARE IN THE WORLD TO COME?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Every Yisrael has a share in the world to come - "v'Amcha Kulam Tzadikim l'Olam Yirshu Aretz";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The following have no share in the world to come:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who says that the Torah does not teach that there is a world to come, or that Hash-m did not give the Torah, or an Apikorus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, even one who reads foreign books (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who whispers "Kol ha'Machalah... Lo Asim Alecha Ki Ani Hash-m Rofe'echa" over a wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Aba Sha'ul says, even one who pronounces Hash-m's name like it is written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Three kings and four commoners have no share in the world to come:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The kings are Yarav'am, Achav and Menasheh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, Menasheh has a share in the world to come, for it says "va'Yispalel Elav… va'Yishma Techinaso ya'Yshivehu Yerushalayim l'Malchuso"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> He returned him to his kingship, but He did not return him to life in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The commoners are Bil'am, Do'eg, Achitofel and Gechazi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If one says that the Torah does not teach that there is a world to come, why does he have no share in the world to come?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Since he denies Techiyas ha'Mesim, he has no share in it. Hash-m always bestows Midah k'Neged Midah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Hash-m always bestows Midah k'Neged Midah. "Ka'Es Machar Se'ah Soles... b'Sha'ar Shomron... Hinei Hash-m Oseh Arubus b'Shamayim" (People were starving in the siege, and Elisha said that tomorrow flour will be cheap. The king's servant voiced his disbelief.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Because he did not believe the miracle would happen, he did not benefit from it - "Hincha Ro'eh b'Einecha umi'Sham Lo Sochel... va'Yirmesu Oso ha'Am ba'Sha'ar (he was trampled)."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">90b----------------------------------------90b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this was because Elisha cursed him, but not because Hash-m bestows Midah k'Neged Midah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The curse of a Chacham is fulfilled, even if it was given unjustly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ba'Sha'ar" teaches that he was killed for mocking the prophecy about the Sha'ar (price).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SOURCES FOR <i>TECHIYAS HA'MESIM</i> IN THE TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source in the Torah that there is a world to come?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "U'Nsatem... Terumas Hash-m l'Aharon ha'Kohen";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Aharon ha'Kohen did not live forever. He never entered Eretz Yisrael. How can we give Terumah to him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This teaches that in the future we will give Terumah to him, i.e. there will be Techiyas ha'Mesim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (and Rejection of Answer (b) - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> The verse teaches that we should give Terumah to Kohanim like Aharon, i.e. Chaverim (those who fulfill the Mitzvos properly).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> We do not give Terumah to an ignoramus - "Lases Menas ha'Kohanim veha'Leviyim...  Lema'an Yechezku b'Soras Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Only one who vigorously observes Torah has a share.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Ada):</span> Giving Terumah to an ignoramus Kohen is like giving it to a lion;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like when a lion takes an animal from the herd we do not know whether it intends to eat it now or not, likewise, we do not know whether an ignoramus Kohen will eat Terumah in Taharah or Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He causes the Kohen to die - "u'Mesu Vo Ki Yechaleluhu."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">(D'Vei R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> He burdens him with sins - "v'Hisi'u Osam Avon Ashmah b'Achlam Es Kodsheihem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Simai):</span> We learn Techiyas ha'Mesim from the Torah - "ha'Kimosi Es Brisi Lases Lahem Es Eretz Kena'an";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It does not say that Hash-m will give Eretz Yisrael 'Lachem' (to you), rather, "Lahem" (to the Avos), i.e. there will be Techiyas ha'Mesim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Minim):</span> What is the source in the Torah that there is a world to come?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answers:</span> Raban Gamliel gave sources from Torah, Nevi'im and Kesuvim. They did not accept them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From the Torah - Hash-m told Moshe "Hincha Shochev Im Avosecha v'Kam."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Minim:</span> Perhaps 'v'Kam' does not refer to Moshe, rather, to the nation (like the verse continues) - "v'Kam ha'Am ha'Zeh..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel:</span> From Nevi'im - "Yichyu Mesecha..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Minim:</span> Perhaps that refers to the dead that Yechezkeil revived (but there will not be Techiyas ha'Mesim in the future).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel:</span> From Kesuvim - "...Dovev Sifsei Yeshenim"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Minim:</span> Perhaps the lips move, but they do not return to life, as R. Yochanan taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If someone died and a Halachah is said in his name in this world, his lips move in the grave - "Dovev Sifsei Yeshenim"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>In the end, Raban Gamliel gave an answer that they accepted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Raban Gamliel:</span> We learn from "Asher Nishba Hash-m la'Avoseichem Lases Lahem." It does not say 'Lachem', rather, "Lahem." (He will revive the Avos and give Eretz Yisrael to them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Version #2A (our text) Question (Raban Gamliel):</span> Why does it say "v'Atem ha'Devekim ba'Shem Elokeichem... Chayim Kulchem ha'Yom"? Obviously, they are alive!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that even when everyone else is dead, they will be alive.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Version #2B (Maharshal) Raban Gamliel:</span> " ...Chayim Kulchem ha'Yom" - just like you are all alive today, you will all be alive in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Romi'im):</span> What is the source that Hash-m will revive the dead, and that He knows the future?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Chananyah):</span> Hash-m told Moshe "Hincha Shochev Im Avosecha v'Kam."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Minim:</span> Perhaps 'v'Kam' does not refer to Moshe, rather, to the nation - "v'Kam ha'Am...(Yisrael will sin)"!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Hash-m will revive the dead and He knows the future - "Hincha Shochev..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> I refuted the Minim, who deny Techiyas ha'Mesim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Hikares Tikares" (one who transgressed Kares is cut off) in this world. We must say that "Avonah Bah" is in the period of Techiyas ha'Mesim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Why didn't he say that "Hikares Tikares" itself alludes to this world and the next?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> They could answer that the Torah speaks as people do (they sometimes double the word, therefore, we need not expound the extra occurrence).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Tana'im argue as Rav Papa and Abaye do:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "Hikares" in this world, and "Tikares" in the world to come;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> It also says "v'Nichresa." Is there a third world?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, "v'Nichresa" in this world, and "Hikares" in the world to come. (We do not expound) "Tikares" - the Torah speaks as people do.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do R. Akiva and R. Yishmael expound "Avonah Bah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps (Kares is permanent) even if he repented!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Avonah Bah" - Kares is only when he still has his sin (he did not repent from it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Kleopatra):</span> I know that the dead will live - "v'Yatzitzu Me'Ir k'Esev ha'Aretz." Will they be revived clothed or unclothed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Meir):</span> A kernel of wheat is planted unclothed, and sprouts and comes up clothed. Tzadikim are buried clothed, and all the more so they will come up clothed!</p>
