<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim say that a Bas Kohen is burned for Zenus only (in a case when a Bas Yisrael would be choked, e.g) if she had already Nisu'in (or was a Bogeres (more than six months after becoming Bas Mitzvah) or non- virgin), but a (virgin) Na'arah Me'orasah is stoned (like a Bas Yisrael, for this is harsher than burning);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, the Torah is more stringent about an Arusah (she disgraces her father even more, for she was Mezanah while under his jurisdiction) than a Nesu'ah. This shows that stoning is harsher than burning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Stoning is more severe than beheading, for it is given to blasphemers and idolaters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> People of an Ir ha'Nidachas are beheaded, this is more severe!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One who wounds a parent is choked. This is severe, because honor of parents is compared to honor of Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since a Nesu'ah (Bas Yisrael) is choked for Zenus, and a Na'arah Me'orasah (Yisrael) is stoned, it follows that stoning is more severe than choking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Burning is more severe than beheading, for a Bas Kohen who was Mezanah is burned.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Aviha" regarding stoning a Na'arah Me'orasah, and also regarding burning a Bas Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like stoning is more severe than beheading, also burning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Burning is more severe than choking, for a Bas Kohen is burned (the stringency is that she profanes her father).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN A <i>BAS KOHEN</i> IS BURNED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> (Chachamim say that) if a Na'arah Me'orasah Bas Kohen was Mezanah, she is stoned. R. Shimon says, she is burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she was Mezanah with her father, she is stoned. R. Shimon says, she is burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yochanan's Chidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim say that burning applies only to a Nesu'ah (or Bogeres or non-virgin), but not to a (virgin) Na'arah Me'orasah. R. Shimon says that it applies to both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for the argument?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim say that stoning is more severe, and R. Shimon says that burning is more severe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This reason also teaches that anyone who is liable for two Misos receives the harsher one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of R. Shimon's opinion about a Na'arah Me'orasah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> The Torah gave two general rules about a Bas Kohen...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> His rules also apply to a Bas Yisrael! (This questioner already knows R. Shimon's opinion.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> The Torah gave two general rules (that should have applied) <i>even</i> for a Bas Kohen (a Nesu'ah is choked for Zenus, and a Na'arah Me'orasah is stoned);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah said that a Nesu'ah Bas Kohen has a different law than a Nesu'ah Bas Yisrael, and an Arusah Bas Kohen has a different law than an Arusah Bas Yisrael (i.e. the Bas Kohen is burned);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like a Nesu'ah Bas Kohen gets a harsher Misah than a Nesu'ah Bas Yisrael (even Chachamim agree to this), also an Arusah Bas Kohen does.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The special law of a Bas Kohen does not apply to Zomemim witnesses who are killed for testifying that a Nesu'ah or Arusah Bas Kohen was Mezanah (they are choked or stoned, as if they testified about a Bas Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "u'Vas Ish Kohen Ki <i>Sechel</i>" refers even to Chilul (desecration of) Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Liznos" - the verse applies only to Zenus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it even applies to a single girl!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says here "Aviha", like it says about a Na'arah Me'orasah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like there she has a husband, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Aviha" (here) teaches that she is burned only if she was Mezanah with her father (and it is not free for the Gezerah Shavah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Hi Mechaleles" implies that she was Mezanah with someone else (if it was with her father, he is Mechalel her). Therefore, "Aviha" is free for the Gezerah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There it refers to a Na'arah Me'orasah. What is the source to include a Nesu'ah or a Bogeres, even if she is old?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>U</i>'Vas" includes any case.</p>
