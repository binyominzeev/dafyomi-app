<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is liable after he eats Tartimar (this will be explained) of meat and drinks half a Log of Italki wine; (a Log is four Reviyos, about a half liter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, he must eat a Maneh (the weight of 100 Dinarim or 9600 barley seeds, about half a kilo) of meat and drinks a Log of wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>In the following cases, he is exempt:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He ate with a group doing a Mitzvah, such as the meal to signify Ibur Chodesh (when a 30th day is added to the month), or if he ate (Rashi - meat and wine bought with money of) Ma'aser Sheni in Yerushalayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He ate Neveilos, Treifos, Shekatzim u'Rmashim (insects and swarming creatures), Tevel, Ma'aser, Ma'aser Sheni and Hekdesh that were not redeemed;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He ate many foods, but not meat. He drank many beverages, but not wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Zolel v'Sovei" - he must eat meat and drink wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"B'Sov'ei Yayin b'Zolelei Vasar" is not a proof, but it hints at this law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Zeira):</span> I do not know (from elsewhere) what Tartimar is, but since R. Yosi requires twice as much wine as Chachamim, presumably he requires twice as much meat, i.e. Tartimar is half a Maneh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanan bar Moldah):</span> He is liable only if he buys meat and wine cheaply and eats them - "Zolel v'Sovei"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanan bar Moldah):</span> He is liable only if he eats raw meat and drinks unmixed wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah and Rav Yosef say that he is exempt for these!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> R. Chanan refers to wine that is semi- diluted (i.e. it is stronger (less diluted) than people usually drink) and meat that is half-cooked, like thieves (who fear to wait until it is fully cooked) eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> If he ate salted meat or drank unfermented wine, he is exempt. (They are not addicting.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Erev Tishah b'Av, one may not eat two different cooked dishes, nor eat meat or drink wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He may eat salted meat or drink unfermented wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is meat considered salted (regarding Erev Tishah b'Av)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina bar Kahana):</span> It is after the time allowed to eat Shelamim, i.e. two days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long is wine considered unfermented?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is as long as it is Toses (stings, because it is fermenting).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We are not concerned if Toses wine was left uncovered (snakes do not drink it).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long is it considered Toses?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is three days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Ben Sorer u'Moreh, when are meat and wine considered salted/unfermented?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> On Erev Tishah b'Av we may not eat things that cause Simchah. Within two days (of slaughter), meat gives Simchah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, he is liable for addicting meat and wine. Meat after a small delay (Rashi - one night), and wine until 40 days are not addicting.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE USES AND RESULTS OF WINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanan):</span> "Tenu Shechar l'Oved v'Yayin l'Marei Nafesh" - wine was created to console mourners and to give to Resha'im their reward in this world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak):</span> What is the meaning of "Al Tere Yayin Ki Yis'adam"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak):</span> Do not be drawn after wine, for it reddens the faces of Resha'im (gladdens them) in this world and whitens their face (shames them) in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Do not be drawn after wine, for Yis'a<i>dam</i> (it leads to bloodshed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> We read "Tirosh", but sometimes it is written "Tirash"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> If he merits, he will become the Rosh (head). If not, he will become Rash (poor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> We read "Yesamach", and it is written (in a way that allows reading it) "Yeshamach"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If he merits, it will gladden him. If not, it will make him Shamem (desolate).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Wine and nice fragrances made me clever.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Amram brei d'Rav Shemen bar Aba):</span> What do we learn from "l'Mi Oy l'Mi Avoy l'Mi Midyanim l'Mi Si'ach l'Mi Petza'im Chinam l'Mi Chachlilus Einayim; La'Me'acharim Al ha'Yayin."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Amram):</span> People who drink much wine suffer all these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> In Eretz Yisrael, some expound this from beginning to end (like Rav Amram). Some expound it in reverse order (one who suffers all these should indulge in wine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Over Galila'ah):</span> In the Parshah that discusses Noach's drunkenness, 13 words begin with 'Vov-Yud' (suggesting Vai, woe) - "va'Yachel Noach..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> "Va'Yeda Es Asher Osah Lo Beno ha'Katan" - Cham castrated Noach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> He raped him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first opinion says that Cham prevented Noach from having a fourth son. This explains why Noach cursed Cham's fourth son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The second opinion learns from a Gezerah Shavah "va'Yar-va'Yar":</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It says here "va'Yar Cham", like it says (about the rape of Dinah) "va'Yar Osah Shechem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first opinion explained why Noach cursed Cham's fourth son. According to the second opinion, why did he curse the fourth son?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The second opinion says that Cham raped <i>and</i> castrated Noach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> "Va'Yachel Noach Ish ha'Adamah" - Hash-m told Noach, you should have learned from Adam ha'Rishon (who was created from earth). Wine was his downfall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>This is like the opinion that the Etz ha'Da'as was a grapevine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The Etz ha'Da'as was a vine, which brings more misery to the world than anything else.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, it was wheat. A child does not know to call to his parents until he tastes grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Nechemyah says, it was a fig tree. Their remedy ("va'Yisperu Ale Se'enah", clothes made from fig leaves) was from the same thing that they sinned with.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Divrei l'Mu'el... Asher Yisarto Imo" - Bas Sheva tied Shlomo to a beam and lashed him (for eating too much);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Mah Bri..." - people know that your father was a Tzadik. They will assume that I am responsible for you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"U'Mah Bar Bitni" - David would not have Bi'ah with his other wives when they were pregnant. I asserted myself, for this improves the fetus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"U'Meh Bar Nedarai" - David's other wives (prayed and) vowed what they would do if they would have a son proper for kingship. I vowed in order that my son should be zealous, a Chacham, and proper for prophecy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Al la'Melachim Sheso Yayin" - why should you be with kings who drink, get drunk and renounce Hash-m?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> "Ul'Roznim Ei Shechar" - you know all the secrets of the world. Will you drink and get drunk?!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Shlomo admitted to his mother - "Ki Ba'ar Anochi...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ki Ba'ar Anochi me'Ish" - I am more foolish than Noach, about whom it says "va'Yachel Noach Ish ha'Adamah";</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If they were not doing a Mitzvah, he is liable, even if they are not all worthless!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. It teaches that even if they are all worthless, if the meal was a Mitzvah, he is exempt, for he will not become habituated to this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The meal to signify Ibur Chodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that they eat meat and wine at the meal of Ibur Chodesh.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The meal of Ibur Chodesh must have at least 10 men. They bring only bread of grain and legumes. They enter (the place where they will eat) on the night after the 30th, at night, and not during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> They enter during the day, and not at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They enter during the day to publicize the matter. The meal itself is at night.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He is exempt for Shekatzim u'Rmasim because they are forbidden. If he ate Tehorim, he would be liable, even though they are not animals!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>'A Mitzvah' is consolation of mourners. 'A transgression' is eating on a fast day.</p>
