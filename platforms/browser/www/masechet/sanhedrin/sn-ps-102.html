<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>YARAV'AM CAUSED YISRAEL TO SERVE IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Also Achiyah ha'Shiloni mistakenly believed that Yarav'am was just testing them, and signed (approval):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"...Yehu... Hetivosa La'asos ha'Yashar b'Einai...(Yehu did Hash-m's will)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Yehu... Lo Sar me'Al Chata'os Yarav'am." Why did he sin?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It is because one's words are fulfilled. He had said "Achav Avad Es ha'Ba'al Me'at Yehu Ya'avdenu Harbeh" (even though he said this only in order to kill the worshippers of Ba'al)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He saw Achiyah ha'Shiloni's signature (approving of Yarav'am).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "V'Shachata Setim <i>Hemiku</i> va'Ani Musar l'Chulam" - the straying idolaters went deeper (were more stringent) than I. One who does not come to the Mikdash on the festivals transgresses an Aseh. They would kill one who did not come to the idolatrous festivals!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> "V'Yarav'am Yatza mi'Yerushalayim va'Yimtza Oso Achiyah ha'Shiloni..." - it was a time destined for punishments.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Also the following were times destined for punishments - "b'Es Pekudasam Yovedu" (idolatry will cause the Churban and (ensuing) Galus, on the ninth of Av), "uv'Yom Pokdi u'Fokadti Aleihem Chatasam" (every punishment of Yisrael will include punishment for the Egel), "ba'Es ha'Hi va'Yered Yehudah" (his first two sons died, and Tamar was sentenced to die).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> A time destined for good is "b'Es Ratzon Anisicha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> "Va'Yelech Rechav'am Shechem Ki Shechem Ba Chol Yisrael Lehamlich Oso" - a place destined for punishments (the 10 tribes split off);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Shechem was a place destined for punishments. Dinah was raped there, Yosef's brothers sold him there, and the kingdom of Beis David split there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> "V'Yarav'am Yotza mi'Yerushalayim" - he ceased to be a constituent of Yerushalayim (and Avodas Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "...Miskaseh <i>b'Salmah Chadashah</i>"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Just like there is no defect in a new garment, there was no defect in Yarav'am's Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Achiyah and Yarav'am said Chidushei Torah that no one had ever heard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "u'Shneihem Levadam ba'Sadeh"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> Compared to them, all other Chachamim were (insignificant) like grass of the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The reasons for all the Mitzvos were exposed to them like a field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> "Titni Shiluchim Al Moreshes Gas..." - when Yisrael made Yarav'am king, a Bas Kol announced 'you send away the descendants of the one (David) who killed the Plishti (Galyus) and bequeathed to you the city of Gas (and you pick new kings)'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Batei Achziv l'Achzav l'Malchei Yisrael" - because you were disloyal to Beis David, you will fall to Nochrim, who are steeped in deceit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> Anyone who benefits from this world without blessing, it is as if he steals from Hash-m and the congregation of Yisrael - "Gozel Aviv v'Imo..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Aviv" refers to Hash-m. "Imo" refers to the congregation of Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Chaver Hu l'Ish Mashchis"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is a colleague of Yarav'am, who Hishchis (corrupted) Yisrael's devotion to Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanin):</span> "Va'Yadach Yarav'am Es Yisrael me'Acharei Hash-m" - like a stick used to hit another stick and cast it afar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(D'Vei R. Yanai):</span> "V'Di Zahav" - Moshe said to Hash-m 'You bestowed gold and silver to Yisrael until they said 'Dai (enough)'! This caused them to make idols of gold.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A parable explains this. A lion does not roar when it has a box of straw, only when it has a box of meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> Before Yarav'am, Yisrael nursed one calf (they were punished for serving the golden calf). He added two more, and now Yisrael are punished for three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Uv'Yom Pokdi u'Fokadti..." - every punishment that comes to the world includes a small amount of punishment for the first Egel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> No, the punishment was completed 24 generations later (with the Churban in the days of Tzidkiyahu) - "Korvu Pekudos ha'Ir."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE THREE KINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Achar ha'Davar ha'Zeh Lo Shav Yarav'am." What happened before?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> Hash-m grabbed him by his garment and said 'repent, and I, you and David will walk together in Gan Eden';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Yarav'am:</span> Who will be in front (I or David)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> David will be in front.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Yarav'am:</span> If so, I am not interested.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Avahu was expounding about the three kings (without a share in the world to come). He fell sick. He resolved not to expound about them.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">102b----------------------------------------102b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>He recovered, and resumed expounding about them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> Didn't you resolve not to expound about them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Avahu:</span> They did not cease their evil. Should I cease expounding about them?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Ashi finished teaching. He was up to the three kings. He deridingly said 'tomorrow we will discuss our <i>colleagues</i>.' Menasheh came to him in a dream.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Menasheh:</span> Do you consider us the colleagues of you and your father?! From where should one slice bread (after the blessing)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Menasheh:</span> You do not know where to slice bread, and you call us your colleagues?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Teach me, and tomorrow I will teach the law in your name.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Menasheh:</span> We cut from where it first forms a crust .</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Since you were such Chachamim, why did you serve idolatry? (Perhaps Menasheh became a Chacham on his last 33 years, when he did Teshuvah! Perhaps Rav Ashi asked about the other kings, who never repented, for Menasheh implied that also they were greater than Rav Ashi.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Menasheh:</span> (There was a tremendous Yetzer ha'Ra for it.) Had you lived in my days, you would have picked up the bottom of your garment to enable you to run quickly to serve!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ACHAV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The next day, Rav Ashi said 'we will expound about our teachers:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Achav was an Ach to Shamayim, and an Av (father) of idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> He was an Ach (pain) to Shamayim - "Ach l'Tzarah Yivaled"</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Maharsha):</span> When he was Ach (in pain), he turned to Shamayim - "Ach l'Tzarah Yivaled";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Version #3:</span> He was an Ach (brother) to Shamayim (Iyun Yakov - Chachamim benefited from his property; ha'Rif - he honored the Torah) - "Ach l'Tzarah Yivaled."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"K'Rachem Av Al Banim" - he loved idolatry as a father loves his children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Ha'Nakel Lechto b'Chata'os Yarav'am" - Achav's lightest transgressions were like Yarav'am's most severe ones;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah attributes sins (of other wicked kings) to Yarav'am, because was the initiator.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Mizbechosam k'Galim Al Talmei Sadai" - in every furrow in Eretz Yisrael, Achav erected an idol and bowed to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that he has no share in the world to come?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Hichrati l'Achav... v'Atzur" - in this world, "v'Azuv" in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Omri merited to be king because he added a city to Yisrael - "va'Yiken Es ha'Har... va'Yiven Es ha'Har."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Achav merited to be king for 22 years because he honored the Torah, which is written with 22 letters;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Omar Ben Hadad Kaspecha u'Zhavcha Li Hu v'Nashecha u'Vanecha... Kol Machmad Einecha Yasimu v'Yadam v'Lokachu." Achav conceded to "Kol Asher Shilachta... veha'Davar ha'Zeh Lo Uchal La'asos."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "Machmad Einecha", the only thing Achav that would not relinquish, refers to the Sefer Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Va'Yomru Elav Kol ha'Zekenim v'Chol ha'Am Al Tishma." (Zekenim would not insist on keeping idolatry.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Zekenim does not refer to Chachamim, rather, to old wicked people!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "Va'Yishar ha'Davar (to seek to kill David immediately) b'Einei Avshalom uv'Einei Kol Ziknei Yisrael" - these Zekenim were wicked old people.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here it says "v'Chol ha'Am" (also wanted to keep Machmad Einecha). There were some Tzadikim among them - "v'Hish'arti v'Yisrael Shiv'as Alafim... Asher Lo Kor'u la'Ba'al."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Achav's Mitzvos and sins weighed equally. "Mi Yefateh Es Achav... va'Yomer Zeh b'Cho v'Zeh Omer b'Cho." Hash-m had to find a volunteer to entice him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> It says "Lo Hayah ch'Achav Asher Himacher La'asos ha'Ra... Hesatah Oso Izevel Ishto." You cannot say that his deeds were equal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Every day she gave gold to idolatry (Maharsha - as if to redeem him from the idolatry, to which he was sold).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Achav was easygoing with his money, and Chachamim benefited from his property. This atoned for half his sins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Va'Yetzei ha'Ru'ach... Ani Afatenu... v'Hayisi Ru'ach Sheker b'Fi Kol Nevi'av..." - the Ru'ach was that of Navos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> "Va'Yomer (Hash-m) Tzei" - Hash-m told him 'leave My Presence.' "Dover Shekarim Lo Yikon l'Neged Einai."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is like people say, that one who takes vengeance destroys his own house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "...Va'Yosef Achav La'asos Lehach'is Es Hash-m... mi'Kol Malchei Yisrael" - he wrote in the gates of Shomron 'Achav Kafar b'Elokei Yisrael.' Therefore, has no share in Hash-m (i.e. the world to come).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> "Va'Yvakesh Es Achazyahu va'Yilkeduhu v'Hu Mischabei b'Shomron" - he would erase Hash-m's name from Sifrei Torah, and write the name of idolatry in its place. (He had to hide to do this.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MENASHEH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>He is called Menasheh because Nashah Kah (he forgot Hash-m). Alternatively, he made Yisrael forget Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's source that he has no share in the world to come?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "...Ka'asher Osah Achav" - just like Achav has no share, also Menasheh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Menasheh has a share in the world to come - "va'Yispalel... va'Ye'aser Lo" (Hash-m accepted his prayer).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Chachamim and R. Yehudah expound the same verse - "l'Za'avah l'Chol Mamlachos ha'Aretz Biglal Menasheh":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah holds that the reason they will tremble is because he repented, but they did not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim explain that they will suffer because he did not repent, and they were drawn after him.</p>
