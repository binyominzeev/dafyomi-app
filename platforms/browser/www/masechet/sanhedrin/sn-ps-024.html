<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DISQUALIFYING JUDGES AND WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Ravin):</span> In the Reisha, Reuven disqualified Shimon's witnesses and his choice of judges, and it was found (undisputedly) that the witnesses are indeed invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says, Migo (since) Reuven was right about the witnesses, he is also believed about the judges. (Chachamim do not say Migo);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the Seifa, Reuven disqualified Shimon's witnesses and judges, and it was found that the judges are indeed invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Meir says, Migo Reuven was right about the judges, he is believed also about the witnesses. (Chachamim do not say Migo.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Granted, when Reuven was right about the witnesses, we let him disqualify the judges. Shimon (need not lose, he) can go to another Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, when Reuven was right about the judges, why can he disqualify the witnesses? Shimon will lose, unless he can find more witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Shimon has another pair of witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If Shimon has only one pair of witnesses, Reuven cannot disqualify his witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ravin's answer is the same as Rav Dimi's (Answer #3 above)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether or not we say Migo. Ravin says that R. Meir applies Migo (also elsewhere), and Rav Dimi says that he does not (and here he can disqualify one pair even without the Migo).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish (above)):</span> The awesome R. Meir would never say this (that either party can disqualify the other's witnesses)! Rather, R. Meir says that either party can disqualify the other's <i>witness</i>!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHACHAMIM OF ISRAEL ENDEAR EACH OTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ula said, Reish Lakish would uproot mountains and grind them against each other (his reasoning was so sharp. Why would he speak so reverently of R. Meir?)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> R. Meir was even sharper. He uprooted giant mountains and ground them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches how much Chachamim endeared each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Hatmanah (wrapping food to preserve its temperature) of cold food is forbidden on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi:</span> My father permitted it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> The elder has already ruled! (I retract.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> See how much Chachamim endeared each other! If R. Yosi was alive, he would have been submissive to Rebbi, for R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi was as great as his father, and he was submissive to Rebbi. Still, Rebbi said 'the elder has already ruled!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> We learn this from "...Shnei Maklos... No'am (and) Chovelim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"No'am" refers to Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael, who pleasantly help each other in Halachah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Chovelim" refers to Chachamim of Bavel, who attack (try to refute) each other in Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> It says "... Bnei ha'Yitzhar ha'Omedim", and (before this) "u'Shnayim Zeisim Aleha." "Yitzhar" refers to Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael, who are as pleasant to each other in Halachah as olive oil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Zeisim" refer to Chachamim of Bavel, who are as bitter to each other in Halachah as olives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "...Shtayim Nashim Yotze'os v'Ru'ach b'Chanfeihem... va'Tisenah Es ha'Eifah..." - the two women represent flattery and haughtiness, which descended to Bavel;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned that 10 Kavim (measures) of haughtiness descended to the world. Eilam (Shushan) received nine, and the rest of the world received one!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It first descended to Bavel, and later it spread (and Eilam got most of it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> "Livnos <i>Lah</i> Bayis b'Eretz Shinar" (only one of the women (flattery) will stay in Bavel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned that poverty is a sign of haughtiness, and poverty is in Bavel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Poverty <i>in Torah</i> is a sign of haughtiness (and that is in Eilam).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Achos Lanu Ketanah v'Shadayim Ein Lah" refers to Eilam, which merited to learn but not to teach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the significance of the name 'Bavel'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It is Balul (blended) with written Torah, Mishnah, and Talmud.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> "B'Machashakim Hoshivani k'Mesei Olam" refers to the Talmud of Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MAY ONE RETRACT AFTER ACCEPTING INVALID JUDGES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven said 'you may use my father (or your father, or three cattle shepherds) to judge our case', he may retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, he may not retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Meir says, if Shimon was obligated to swear to Reuven, and Reuven said 'you may swear to me by the life of your head', Reuven can retract (and demand a proper oath, which is with Hash-m's name);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, he may not retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Dimi brei d'Rav Nachman):</span> The case is, he accepted his (or his opponent's father) to be one of the judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Tana'im argue in a case that Reuven claims from Shimon, and agreed to pardon him (if a Beis Din including his father (or...) will rule that Shimon is exempt);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if Shimon claims from Reuven, and Reuven agreed to pay him (if such a Beis Din will obligate Reuven), all agree that Reuven may retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They argue in a case that Reuven agreed to pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he mean that they argue only when Reuven agreed to pay, but all agree that he may not retract when he agreed to pardon him (if such a Beis Din will exempt Shimon)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, does he mean that they argue even when Reuven agreed to pay?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava taught that they argue only when Reuven agreed to pay, but all agree that he may not retract when he agreed to pardon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If this is R. Yochanan's opinion, Rava holds like R. Yochanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if R. Yochanan says that they argue in both cases, like whom does Rava hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rava gives his own (third) opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - Rav Acha bar Tachlifa - Beraisa):</span> If Shimon was obligated to swear to Reuven, and Reuven said 'you may swear to me by the life of your head', Reuven can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, he may not retract.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shimon was obligated to swear that he is exempt, and Reuven agreed to pardon him (if he swears by his head).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, Shimon was obligated to swear in order to collect, and Reuven agreed to pay him (if he takes such an oath).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to Rava,) the Reisha discusses when Reuven agreed to pay. Why must also the Seifa teach this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches when he agreed to pay if others (invalid judges) will say so, and when he agreed to pay if his opponent wants (and swears);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It needed to teach both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only when he agreed to pay if others will say so, one might have thought that only then R. Meir allows him to retract, because he did not decide absolutely to pay (perhaps the judges will acquit him), but R. Meir agrees that Reuven cannot retract when he agreed to pay if Shimon wants;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had it taught only when he agreed to pay if Shimon wants (to swear), one might have thought that only then Chachamim do not allow him to retract (for he knew that Shimon will take the oath to collect), but Chachamim agree that Reuven can retract when he accepted invalid judges.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN MAY ONE RETRACT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The argument is before the final verdict, but after the final verdict, all agree that he cannot retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They argue after the final verdict.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he mean that they argue only after the final verdict, but before this, all agree that he can retract?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, does he mean that they argue even after the final verdict?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava taught that if he accepted a relative or invalid witness, he can retract only until the final verdict.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If this is R. Yochanan's opinion, Rava holds like R. Yochanan, according to Chachamim (surely, he would not rule like R. Meir against Chachamim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if R. Yochanan says that they argue in both cases, like whom does Rava hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We conclude that they argue only after the final verdict. (Here we cannot say that Rava is a third opinion, for he merely rules like one of the opinions.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> Is the argument before or after the final verdict? Like whom is the Halachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yakov):</span> The argument is after the final verdict. The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Ashi) Question (Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> Is the argument when Reuven agreed to pardon Shimon, or when Reuven agreed to pay him (if a Beis Din with his father... will rule this way)? Like whom is the Halachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yakov):</span> The argument is when Reuven agreed to pay. The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (Chachamim of Pumbadisa) Question (Bei Rav):</span> May Reuven retract before the final verdict if a Kinyan was done?</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>INVALID JUDGES AND WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are disqualified (from judging or testifying): diceplayers, those who lend on Ribis (usury), Mafrichei Yonim (this will be explained) and Socharei (those who sell) Shemitah Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> At first, they used to call such people gatherers of Shemitah Peros. After extortionists became rampant, they called them Socharei Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> When is this? It is if they have no other profession. If they have another profession, they are Kesherim.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> Betting is Asmachta (the loser did not expect to lose. He did not decide absolutely to give his money). It is not a Kinyan (the winner is not entitled to the money).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Sheshes):</span> This is not Asmachta (the loser realized that he may win or lose. He knowingly agreed that the loser will pay!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> They are disqualified because they do not contribute to society.</p>
