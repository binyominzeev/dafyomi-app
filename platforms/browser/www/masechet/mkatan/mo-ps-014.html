<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>GEMARA</i> - REASON FOR NOT SHAVING AND LAUNDERING ON CHOL HA'MO'ED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are shaving and laundering on Chol ha'Mo'ed forbidden in the first place? (It should have been permitted because it is one of the needs of the holiday - Tosfos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is so that people should be extra careful not to neglect doing these things, making themselves clean and tidy, before the holiday begins.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah mentioned a list of several extenuating circumstances of people who could not possibly have shaved or laundered before the holiday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> What about a different extenuating circumstance: Someone lost an object and spent the entire Erev Yom Tov looking for it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This case is certainly forbidden, because people who see him cutting his hair or laundering during Chol ha'Mo'ed will not necessary know he has a good excuse. (Whereas the cases in the Mishnah are more known to the public.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan said that if someone has only one robe he may wash it on Chol ha'Mo'ed Here, too, people might not know he has a good excuse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They can tell by the way the man is dressed that he doesn't have another robe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Alternate version of R. Zeira's question:</span> If the town barber loses an object on Erev Yom Tov and, since everyone goes to the barber on Erev Yom Tov, everyone in town knows about his situation, can he shave and launder during Chol ha'Mo'ed? No answer is given.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CLARIFICATION OF <i>MISHNAH'S</i> STATEMENT IN 1:a:1</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A Beraisa states the opinion of R. Yehudah that disagrees with the Mishnah's (1:a:1) leniency for someone who has just returned from a trip abroad. He says that since the trip was undertaken voluntarily it is not a good excuse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rava's clarification of the issues:</span> It it was a pleasure trip that he went on, all agree that it is forbidden to shave and launder upon his return. If it was an absolutely necessary business trip (to make a living) all agree it is permitted to shave and launder. The argument is when the trip was for an unnecessary business trip (to make more money than one needs for a living) - the Mishnah permits it and R. Yehudah forbids it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A Beraisa is quoted which seems to say that all three cases described by Rava (pleasure, necessary business, extra business) are subjects of argument between R. Yehudah and Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Beraisa is reinterpreted to say the same thing that Rava said.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>A HAIRCUT FOR A NEWBORN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Statement (Shmuel):</span> It is permitted to give a haircut to a baby born on Chol ha'Mo'ed, because it comes under "One who is released from imprisonment during Chol ha'Mo'ed" (1:a:2).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Implication:</span> If the baby was born before Yom Tov the haircut is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa makes the following equation: All the exceptions our Mishnah lists for Chol ha'Mo'ed apply to a mourner as well. The Gemara assumes that the converse is also true: Anyone who is <b>NOT</b> permitted to shave during Chol ha'Mo'ed is not permitted to shave during mourning. Applying this converse principle to 5:b, we come out with the law that a newborn who is in mourning may not have his hair cut. This contradicts a Beraisa that states that mourning rituals are not observed by small children (except the ripping of the clothing).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our assumption (in 5:c) that the converse of the Beraisa's statement is also true was a mistake. In other words, there are people who are not permitted to shave during Chol ha'Mo'ed, but may shave during mourning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Alternate version of Shmuel's statement:</span> A newborn may be given a haircut on Chol ha'Mo'ed, whether he was born before or during the holiday. According to this version the Question of 5:c turns into a proof, and the Answer of 5:d turns into a refutation of the proof.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>A MOURNER, A <i>MENUDEH</i> (EXCOMMUNICATED PERSON) AND A <i>METZORA</i> ON HOLIDAYS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Mourning is not observed during a holiday, because the general requirement of joyfulness overrides the individual's requirement of mourning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Are the laws of Menudeh observed on the holiday?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A proof is brought from a Beraisa that they are observed. The Beraisa says that on Chol ha'Mo'ed Beis Din may judge cases involving monetary matters, Malkos and capital punishment. This must include not only the discussion and decision of the cases, but also the implementation of punishment (in the case of monetary matters the punishment is Niduy), for in the case of capital punishment it is forbidden to leave a condemned criminal unpunished for even one day.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is it possible to execute someone on Chol ha'Mo'ed? There is a Beraisa that requires the judges to fast on a day when they condemn someone to execution, and fasting is forbidden on Chol ha'Mo'ed</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The condemnation can be left until the end of the day, and only the last few moments of the day need be spent in fasting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Are the laws of Metzora observed on the holiday?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Attempted proof:</span> The Mishnah permits shaving and laundering for a Metzora who has become purified during Chol ha'Mo'ed The implication is that if he did not become purified he may not shave or launder.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Mishnah could mean that <b>EVEN</b> a Metzora who has become purified during Chol ha'Mo'ed may shave and launder (although one might have thought that it might lead to the Metzora purposely delaying his purification ritual until the holiday) - and it goes without saying that a Metzora who is not purified may also shave and launder.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Proof:</span> A Kohen Gadol must observe the rules of Metzora, and every day is a Moed for a Kohen Gadol. Hence, a Metzora must observe his rules on Chol ha'Mo'ed</p>
