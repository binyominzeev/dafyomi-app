<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Tana Kama's opinion:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Shabbos (some translate "week") the mourner should not leave his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The second Shabbos (or week) he goes to Shul but does not sit in his usual seat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The third Shabbos (or week) he can sit in his seat, but he shouldn't talk to anyone.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>From the fourth Shabbos (week) and on he is back to normal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah's opinion</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first and second Shabbos (week) he should not leave his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The third Shabbos (week) he goes to Shul but does not sit in his usual seat.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>BERAISA</i> ABOUT MARRIAGE FOR A MOURNER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A mourner should not marry during Shloshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the mourning is for one's wife, he should not get remarried until the three Regalim have passed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah permits getting remarried before the third Regel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If the mourner (even for his wife) has no children yet he may remarry immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If his wife left him small children who require looking after, he may also marry immediately, like when Yosef Hakohen married his sister-in-law at his wife's funeral.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Yosef Hakohen's case he nevertheless did not consummate the marriage until after Shloshim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FRESHLY PRESSED CLOTHING FOR A MOURNER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A Beraisa records three opinions:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> Freshly pressed clothing, whether new or old, may not be worn during Shloshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> Only <i>new</i> pressed clothing is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> Only new <i>white</i> pressed clothing is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Halachah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye conducted himself like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava conducted himself like R. Elazar Berebi Shimon.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MOURNING ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>There is a disagreement between the Judeans and Galileans as to whether any sort of mourning rites are observed on Shabbos (in private only).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Proof (that there is mourning):</span> Because Shabbos counts into the seven days of Shiv'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Proof (that there is no mourning):</span> The Mishnah (above, 19a, 2:c) says Shabbos does not cancel the Shiv'ah. Why would anyone even think that Shabbos cancels the Shiv'ah if mourning is observed on it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Gemara offers possible refutations to both proofs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Gemara attempts to show that the two opinions are found in a Beraisa. The Beraisa deals with someone who has lost a relative and has not yet buried him. (This status is called in later rabbinic literature Onen, so we will call him that here.) It makes several points:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Onen may not eat in the presence of the body, but should go elsewhere, or if this is not possible he should construct a partition of ten tefachim, or if this is not possible he should at least turn around while he eats.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Onen may not eat meat or drink wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He may not recite Brachos over food, whether before or after eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He is exempt from all positive Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>On Shabbos he may eat normally - including meat and wine - and he must recite Brachos, and he must perform all Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel makes a mysterious statement:</span> Since he must observe these, so must he observe everything. What does Raban Gamliel mean to include that the mourner must do that the Tana Kama did not include? It must be marital relations. (Raban Gamliel says this aspect of Shabbos is also to be observed, while the Tana Kama forbids marital relations.) Hence we see that the issue of private observance of mourning is a disagreement between Raban Gamliel and Tana Kama.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This equation is rejected, because the topic of the Beraisa is an Onen and not a regular mourner. Perhaps the Tana Kama would agree that a regular mourner does not have to refrain from marital relations, or perhaps Raban Gamliel would agree that a regular mourner does have to refrain.</p>
