<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A mourner should not marry during Shloshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the mourning is for one's wife, he should not get remarried until the three Regalim have passed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah permits getting remarried before the third Regel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If the mourner (even for his wife) has no children yet he may remarry immediately.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If his wife left him small children who require looking after, he may also marry immediately, like when Yosef Hakohen married his sister-in-law at his wife's funeral.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MOURNING ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There is a disagreement between the Judeans and Galileans as to whether any sort of mourning rites are observed on Shabbos (in private only).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Proof (that there is mourning):</span> Because Shabbos counts into the seven days of Shiv'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Proof (that there is no mourning):</span> The Mishnah (above, 19a, 2:c) says Shabbos does not cancel the Shiv'ah. Why would anyone even think that Shabbos cancels the Shiv'ah if mourning is observed on it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Gemara offers possible refutations to both proofs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Gemara attempts to show that the two opinions are found in a Beraisa. The Beraisa deals with someone who has lost a relative and has not yet buried him. (This status is called in later rabbinic literature Onen, so we will call him that here.) It makes several points:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Onen may not eat in the presence of the body, but should go elsewhere, or if this is not possible he should construct a partition of ten tefachim, or if this is not possible he should at least turn around while he eats.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Onen may not eat meat or drink wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He may not recite Brachos over food, whether before or after eating.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>He is exempt from all positive Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>On Shabbos he may eat normally - including meat and wine - and he must recite Brachos, and he must perform all Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel makes a mysterious statement:</span> Since he must observe these, so must he observe everything. What does Raban Gamliel mean to include that the mourner must do that the Tana Kama did not include? It must be marital relations. (Raban Gamliel says this aspect of Shabbos is also to be observed, while the Tana Kama forbids marital relations.) Hence we see that the issue of private observance of mourning is a disagreement between Raban Gamliel and Tana Kama.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This equation is rejected, because the topic of the Beraisa is an Onen and not a regular mourner. Perhaps the Tana Kama would agree that a regular mourner does not have to refrain from marital relations, or perhaps Raban Gamliel would agree that a regular mourner does have to refrain.</p></div>
