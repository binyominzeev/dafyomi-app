<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p><i>SHLOSHIM</i> AND YOM TOV (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Question (Beraisa). The Beraisa makes several points:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the burial is less than three days before Yom Tov (e.g., two days), and the Yom Tov therefore does not cancel the Shiv'ah (as the Mishnah says), the last five days of Shiv'ah are held after Yom Tov. During these five days, however, he may have other people do work for him. Furthermore, since consolation visits were already held for seven days (for they are held during the holiday also), there is no need for consolation visits during these five days after Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the burial is <i>during</i> the holiday (e.g., the third-to-last day of the holiday), all seven days of Shiv'ah are held after the holiday. Again, since consolation visits were already held for three days (for they are held during the holiday also), there is no need for consolation visits after four days of Shiv'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The third point of the Beraisa is that the days of the holiday do count into the Shloshim, an explcicit contradiction to Rabah (19b, 5:b).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The law that the days of the holiday count into Shloshim refers only to the first case of the Beraisa, where the burial was <i>before</i> Yom Tov, and some mourning rites were oberved already before Yom Tov. Rabah's ruling was only about a case where the burial was <i>during</i> Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another Beraisa says explicitly that even when the burial is during Yom Tov the days of Yom Tov count into the Shloshim. This is indeed an explicit contradiction to Rabah, and he is refuted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yochanan also disagreed with Rabah and said that the days of Yom Tov count into the days of Shloshim in any event.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>OTHER OPINIONS ABOUT YOM TOV CANCELLING SHIV'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Beraisa lists three opinions:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> If Shiv'ah is observed for three days before Yom Tov, the remainder of Shiv'ah is cancelled (like the Mishnah above, 19a).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> Even if Shiv'ah is observed for an hour (i.e., a short time) Yom Tov cancels it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar b'Rebi Shimon):</span> The matter is a dispute between Beis Shamai (who held like opinion #1) and Beis Hillel (who held #2).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Halachah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah is like opinion #2.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is like the Mishnah (opinion #1).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> The Halachah is like opinion #2.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SOURCE FOR SHIV'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Biblical source for a seven-day period of mourning?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Pasuk in Amos, which compares mourning to a festival. We derive that just as a festival is seven days, so is mourning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is also a one-day festival, Shavuos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is indeed a one-day period of mourning sometimes - when a person finds out about the death of a relative a long time after it happened (henceforth: Shemu'ah Rechokah, or S. R.).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SHEMU'AH RECHOKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Beraisa makes two points:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is no Shiv'ah or Shloshim for a Shemu'ah Rechokah (S.R.), only a one-day observance, according to R. Akiva. The Chachamim disagree and require a full Shiv'ah and Shloshim for S.R.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">The definition of S.R. is:</span> When the news is received thirty days after the death.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Although the Halachah is usually like the majority opinion, here there is an overriding rule: The Halachah is always in accordance with the lenient opinion (even a minority opinion) when it comes to matters of mourning. (Therefore, the Halachah is like R. Akiva.) Rav Chisda and Rava also ruled like this, even for a father or mother.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a Beraisa that says that although S.R. is observed only one day, when it comes to a father or mother it is observed like regular mourning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This Beraisa is a minority opinion (Elisha Ben Avuyah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rav Achiya observed Shiv'ah and Shloshim for his son, in a S.R.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>There is a story that R. Chiya found out from Rav (who was his nephew) that his (R. Chiya's) brother and sister had died (some time earlier), and he told his attendant to take off his shoes and bring some clothing to the bathhouse and meet him there. This story teaches us three things:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A mourner may not wear shoes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Mourning for a S.R. is observed only one day (because he went to the bathhouse to bathe right away).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>That "one day" is not a whole day, but just a short while (until the walk to the bathhouse).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Assuming that R. Achiya and R. Chiya are the same person, R. Chiya's behavior (observing only one day for S.R.) contradicts what he did for his son (3:e).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chiya is not the same person as R. Achiya.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi Bar Avin):</span> If someone hears about a death on the thirtieth day after it happened (when it was not yet S.R.), but it was Yom Tov, so he could not observe any mourning then, and by the time Yom Tov was over it was already after the thirtieth day - it is considered a S.R. A Beraisa says the same thing about when the thirtieth day is on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does a S.R. require Keri'ah? (Tosfos: The question is only for this case, where the news was received on the thirtieth day which was Shabbos or Yom Tov; a regular S.R. certainly does not require Keri'ah. Others: The question is about all S.R.s.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Mani):</span> No Keri'ah is done. There is no such thing as Keri'ah without Shiv'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> :Keri'ah is done.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa says that if someone has no robe for Keri'ah when he hears about a death, and gets one later, during Shiv'ah, he does Keri'ah then; if he gets the robe only after Shiv'ah he does not do Keri'ah. R. Zeira added that for a mother or father Keri'ah is done even after Shiv'ah. Hence, we see that there is such a thing as Keri'ah without Shiv'ah. This is a question on R. Mani's rule.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is not a real Keri'ah, just a sign of respect for one's mother or father.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>FOR WHICH RELATIVES DOES ONE MOURN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There is a Beraisa that makes several points:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The seven relatives mentioned in Vayikra 21:2-3 (spouse, father, mother, son, daughter, brother, unmarried sister) are those that one must mourn.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The brother and sister mentioned in that verse refer only to siblings from a common father. The Rabbis added to the list siblings who share a common mother. They also added to the list married sisters.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One should mourn second-degree relatives as well, i.e. sons of the above seven (Tosfos) and parents' parents (Rashi).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The above is the opinion of R. Akiva; R. Shimon Ben Elazar says the only second-degree relatives to be mourned are grandparents and grandchildren.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The Chachamim agree with R. Akiva, but limit mourning for second-degree relatives to when one is in the presence of the first-degree relative who himself is in mourning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> When the Beraisa requires mourning for second-degree relatives, it does not apply to one's wife's relatives, except for her parents.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> There is one Beraisa that says that when one's father-in-law or mother-in-law dies he should observe mourning with his wife. Another Beraisa says that when a woman is in mourning she should nevertheless do wifely chores such as making her husband's bed and washing him up. Since having a bed and washing up are forbidden to mourners, obviously the husband is not observing mourning with her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> The first Beraisa is only talking about when the wife's parent died (as it says explicitly); the second Beraisa is talking about when other relatives of the wife died. This corresponds exactly with what R. Huna said.</p></div>
