<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HAIRCUTS FOR A MOURNER, A MENUDEH AND A METZORA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A mourner may not cut his hair, as derived from a Pasuk in the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May a Menudeh and Metzora cut their hair?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Beraisa explicitly says no. (It also says that if a Menudah dies during his Niduy a large stone is placed over his casket.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WRAPPING OF THE HEAD FOR A MOURNER, A MENUDEH AND A METZORA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A mourner must wrap his head with a kerchief (see Tosfos 21a why this is not done any more), as derived from Yechezkel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Must a Menudeh wrap his head?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Gemara attempts to bring a proof that he must from a Beraisa that deals with people who have fasted for rain but did not have their prayers answered. "They must sit with their heads wrapped like Menudim and mourners."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The proof is rejected, because in that case the people are Menudim from Hash-m Himself, and this is a more serious type of Niduy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A Metzora must wrap his head, as it says clearly in the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TEFILIN FOR A MOURNER, A MENUDEH AND A METZORA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A mourner may not put on Tefilin (see below, 21a, for details), as derived from Yechezkel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>May a Menudeh put on Tefilin? The question remains unanswered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>May a Metzora put on Tefilin?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Gemara attempts to bring a proof from a Beraisa that discusses the Torah's law that a Metzora must be "Pore'a" his head. R. Eliezer says this means that he must grow his hair. R. Akiva says it means he may not put something <b>ON</b> his head. The Gemara thinks that this "something" is Tefilin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The proof is rejected. The "something" might be just a hat or head ornament.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>GREETINGS FOR A MOURNER, A MENUDEH AND A METZORA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A mourner may not give a greeting (see below, 21b, for details), as derived from Yechezkel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>May a Menudeh give a greeting?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Gemara attempts to bring a proof from the above Beraisa (2:b:1) that deals with people who have fasted for rain. "They must not greet each other."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The proof is rejected on the same grounds as it was in 2:b:2.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>May a Metzora give a greeting?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Beraisa states clearly that he may not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa seems to imply that a Menudeh may also not give a greeting, so why do we not use it as a proof for Menudeh?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa does not necessarily carry this implication about the Menudeh.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>TORAH LEARNING FOR A MOURNER, A MENUDEH AND A METZORA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A mourner may not study Torah, as derived from Yechezkel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>May a Menudeh study Torah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Beraisa states explicitly that he may learn or teach Torah. (However, a Muchram [more serious than a Menudeh] may only learn by himself but not teach or be taught by others.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>May a Metzora study Torah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Beraisa states explicitly that he may study Torah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>LAUNDERING FOR A MOURNER, A MENUDEH AND A METZORA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A mourner may not launder his clothes, as derived from Sefer Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>May a Menudeh and a Metzora launder their clothes?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Beraisa states explicitly that they may not.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>RIPPING CLOTHES FOR A MOURNER, A MENUDEH AND A METZORA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A mourner must rip his clothing, as derived from the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Must a Menudeh rip his clothing? No answer is given.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A Metzora must rip his clothing, as the Torah says explicitly.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>TURNING THE BED OVER FOR A MOURNER, A MENUDEH AND A METZORA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A mourner must turn his bed over (see Tosfos 21a why this is not done any more). Bar Kapara explains the symbolism behind this act.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Must a Menudeh and a Metzora turn their beds over? The question remains unanswered.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>WORK FOR A MOURNER, A MENUDEH AND A METZORA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A mourner may not do work, as derived from a Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>May a Menudeh do work?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Gemara attempts to bring a proof from a Beraisa that states that people fasting for rain must refrain from work (except at nights) and must do several other mourning-like actions, "and the same goes for a mourner and a Menudeh." The Gemara thinks that the clause "the same goes for... Menudeh" applies to refraining from work.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The proof is rejected, because the clause may be referring to the other mourning-like actions mentioned there.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Another Beraisa states specifically that he may do work.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>May a Metzora do work? The question remains unanswered.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A mourner may not bathe (or anoint his skin with oil), as derived from Sefer Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>May a Menudeh bathe?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Gemara attempts to bring a proof from a Beraisa that states that people fasting for rain must refrain from bathing (except for hands, face and feet) and must do several other mourning-like actions, "and the same goes for a mourner and a Menudeh." The Gemara thinks that the clause "the same goes for... Menudeh" applies to bathing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The proof is rejected, because the clause may be referring to the other mourning-like actions mentioned there.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">11)</span><p>WEARING SHOES FOR A MOURNER, A MENUDEH AND A METZORA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Mourner may not wear shoes, as derived from Yechezkel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>May a Menudeh wear shoes?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Gemara attempts to bring a proof from a Beraisa that states that people fasting for rain must not wear shoes (except when on the road) and must do several other mourning-like actions, "and the same goes for a mourner and a Menudeh." The Gemara thinks that the clause "the same goes for... Menudeh" applies to wearing shoes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The proof is rejected, because the clause may be referring to the other mourning-like actions mentioned there.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">12)</span><p>MARITAL RELATIONSFOR A MOURNER, A MENUDEH AND A METZORA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Marital relations are forbidden to a mourner, as derived from the book of Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>May a Menudeh engage in marital relations?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Gemara attempts to prove that he may, from the fact that the while the Israelites were wandering in the desert they were considered Menudim, and yet they obviously engaged in marital relations.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The proof is rejected because perhaps a Menudah by Hash-m Himself is not the same (it is less serious) as a regular Menudeh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This rejection is based on a line of reasoning which is the exact oppisite of that employed above (2:b:2). The idea is that since it cannot be established with certainty which (if either) kind of Niduy is more strict than the other - regular Menudeh or Menudeh to Hash-m - no conclusion may be drawn in either direction.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>May a Metzora engage in marital relations?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "A Metzora must be like a Menudeh and a mourner, forbidden to engage in marital relations."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Beraisa says "like a Menudeh... forbidden to engage in marital relations," can we derive that a Menudeh is also forbidden to engage in marital relations?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, perhaps the two statements are disjointed: For one thing, he must be like a Menudeh, and for another thing he may not engage in marital relations.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">13)</span><p>SACRIFICES FOR A MOURNER, A MENUDEH AND A METZORA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A mourner may not offer a sacrifice, as derived from the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>May a Menudeh offer a sacrifice?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Gemara attempts to prove that he may, from the fact that the while the Israelites were wandering in the desert they were considered Menudim, and yet they offered sacrifices.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The proof is rejected as above, 12:b:2.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>May a Metzora offer a sacrifice?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Gemara proves that he may not, from a Beraisa in which R. Yehudah and R. Shimon disagree about the interpretation of a Pasuk in Yechezkel, but they both agree to the same basic principle: A sacrifice may be offered only by someone who is himself permitted to enter the Temple (which a Metzora is not).</p></div>
