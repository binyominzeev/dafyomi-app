<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ELABORATION OF <i>MISHNAH'S</i> STATEMENT ON 27a, 4:c</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>There is a dispute as to which women this rule (not placing their bier in the street) applies to.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Neharda'ei):</span> It applies only to women who died in childbirth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> It applies to all women. He backs up his opinion with a Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Gemara then discusses the deaths of Aharon and Miriam.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DIFFERENT KINDS OF DEATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A Beraisa discusses different levels of suddenness of death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Beraisa also discusses ages of people who die:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Death at fifty is what Kares is.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Death at fifty-two is like Shmuel's death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Death at sixty is what Misah b'Yidei Shamayim is.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Death at seventy is considered reaching old age.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Death at eighty is considered having reached the stage of unusually long life ("strength").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Not only is death at fifty Kares, but so is death from fifty to sixty. The Beraisa did not say this explicitly out of respect to Shmuel, who died at fifty-two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>At this point the Gemara tells several stories about various rabbis and their encounters with the angel of death.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>MISHNAH</i> - MOURNING GESTURES ON SEMI-HOLIDAYS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Women may do Me'aneh on Chol ha'Mo'ed, but should not do Metape'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael disagrees, and allows Metape'ach for the women standing next to the bier.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>On Rosh Chodesh, Chanukah and Purim women may do Metape'ach, but not Mekonen. After the burial, the Me'aneh and Metape'ach actions must stop.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Definitions:</span> Me'aneh is when all the women recite a dirge together. Mekonen is when one leads and the others respond.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Statement:</span> In the future there will be no more death.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ABOUT DIRGES AND EULOGIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Gemara brings several samples of dirges that women used to say about different types of people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">A Beraisa talks about reciprocity in mourning:</span> The more one mourns and eulogizes (etc.) others, the more these will be done for him when the time comes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A Beraisa tells the story of the death of R. Yishmael's sons and the consolations offered by his four great teachers.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>MORE ETIQUETTE FOR MOURNERS AND COMFORTERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The consolers should not say anything until the mourner begins the conversation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> The mourner should sit at the head of the table. This is derived from a Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama bar Chanina):</span> A groom should also sit at the head of the table. This is derived from a Pasuk.</p>
