<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>VARIOUS MATTERS CONCERNING NIDUY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Tanchum (or someone else) repeats the inference derived above, 16a, 3:d:1.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> A rabbinical student may take the law into his own hands, if he is sure he's right.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Story:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah put a rabbinical student in Niduy, although the student was a teacher and his own students needed him to teach them. This is because a teacher of Torah is compared to an angel, and if his behavior is questionable he should not be a teacher of Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah died before the Niduy was over, and the other rabbis wouldn't annul it for him, because a Niduy must not be taken lightly, as seen from Rebbi's maid, as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rebbi's maid once put someone in Niduy for hitting his son who was already grown up. This can lead to the son rebelling against his father and dishonoring him. The rabbis heeded her Niduy for three years.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Story:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Resh Lakish once put someone in Niduy for eating dates from a field he was guarding. The man responded by putting Resh Lakish in Niduy for declaring a Niduy for insufficient grounds.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since Resh Lakish didn't know the identity of the man who put him in Niduy, he had to go to the Nasi, who is empowered to annul Niduy in such cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Putting a Rosh Beis Din into Niduy:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> An enactment was made in Usha (the seat of the Sanhedrin at one point) that the head of a Beis Din is not to be put into Niduy. Rather, we say to him politely, "Stay at home." For a repeat offense, however, he is put into Niduy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Even for the second offense there is no Niduy. A Tamid Chacham is never put into public Niduy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Mar Zutra Chasida, before putting a rabbinical student into Niduy, used to first put himself into Niduy (because he felt so bad about what he was about to do - Rashi). When he went home at night, he would annul his own Niduy and then the student's.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Gidel):</span> A Talmid Chacham can put himself in Niduy and release himself from Niduy (as Mar Zutra did above).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> "I deserve great reward, for I never put a rabbinical student into Niduy. When one required disciplining, he would be physically punished instead."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MORE ABOUT NIDUY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>What does the word Shamta (Niduy) mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> It is an acronym for "Death is there."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is an acronym for "He shall be desolation."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Does Niduy have a lasting effect?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Yes, it sticks to one permanently like grease smeared in an oven.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> No; when a Niduy or Cherem is annulled, it is completely erased, leaving no effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Next there are two stories, one about a Niduy against a dog and the other about a Niduy against a gangster, issued in absentia, out of fear.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CLARIFICATION OF <i>MISHNAH</i> ON 14a, 1:a:5-6</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is special permission granted to the Nazir and Metzora to shave because they did not have time to do so before the holiday (their time was not up yet then)? Or are they allowed to shave even if they did have time but neglected to do so, so that they should not delay the sacrifices that come in conjunction with the shaving?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Beraisa explicitly permits it even in the latter case.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>A BERAISA ABOUT SHAVING ON CHOL HA'MO'ED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A mourner and a Kohen may shave on Chol ha'Mo'ed</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of mourner are we dealing with?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Shloshim began before the holiday he should have shaved then (see below, 19a, 2:b). Why does he deserve special permission?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the Shloshim hadn't started yet before the holiday, he is still in Shloshim now, and he can't shave for that reason!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the day when Shloshim started (i.e., the eighth day of mourning according to the Chachamim, who argue with Aba Shaul, who says Shiv'ah finishes on the seventh day in the morning, and Shloshim begins that same day - see below, 19b, 3:b:1-2) was the day before Yom Tov, and it happened to be a Shabbos, so he couldn't shave on that day - the Halachah allows (see below, 19b, 4:b) for shaving on Friday (the seventh day of mourning) in that case, so again he should have shaved before the holiday.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa holds like Aba Shaul, that Shloshim starts on the seventh day, and the case is that the seventh day was Shabbos, so he could not shave then. (Nor could he have shaved on Friday, the sixth day of mourning.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Mishnah didn't mention the case of "mourner" on its list, because it holds like Chachamim (not Aba Shaul), and the only possible case or a mourner being allowed to shave during Chol ha'Mo'ed works out only according to Aba Shaul, as discussed above in (b) and (c).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of "Kohen" in the Beraisa (4:a)? (Background information, supplied by Rashi: 1. A Kohen, during the week of his Mishmar, may not shave. 2. A Mishmar always ends on Shabbos. 3. A Kohen may shave on the Thursday of his Mishmar, in honor of Shabbos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the holiday begins on Sunday (the day after his Mishmar), he should have shaved on Thursday. Why give him special permission? (The same question applies if the holiday begins on Friday or Shabbos of his Mishmar.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The holiday began on Thursday (or Monday - Wednesday, for that matter), so he could not shave then (because of Yom Tov) or before then (because of his Mishmar). That's why he can shave now.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The Mishnah didn't mention the case of "Kohen" on its list, because it holds that, since all Kohanim participate in the sacrifices on a holiday, the holiday is like a Mishmar for them. Thus, they may not shave during the holiday just like they may not shave during their regular Mishmar.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>SHAVING FOR A MOURNER WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One Beraisa (#1) says that all the exceptions listed in the Mishnah (on 14a, 1:a) concerning Chol ha'Mo'ed apply to a mourner as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another Beraisa (#2) says that the exceptions do <b>NOT</b> apply to mourners.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Beraisa is talking about someone who had a second mourning period begin before the first was finished.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another Beraisa (#3) states that someone who has one mourning period right after another may shave and launder - even without the extenuating circumstances of the Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This Beraisa (#3) permits only thinning the beard with a razor (not touching the skin, of course) and laundering without detergent. The extenuating circumstances are necessary to permit regular shaving and laundering, and this is what Beraisa #1 was talking about.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion (from Beraisa #3):</span> A mourner is normally forbidden to launder his clothes.</p></div>
