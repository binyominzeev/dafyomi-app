<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO EXCEEDED THE QUOTA OF FLAWED ITEMS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Noson):</span> If the Ona'ah (overcharge or undercharge) is less than a sixth, the sale stands. If it is more than a sixth, the sale is void. If it is exactly a sixth, the Ona'ah is returned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not say that he returns just enough so that the Ona'ah is a sixth!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that when we return, we must return the entire amount!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is different. There, (it is as if) the seller said that he charges the true value. Since the value is not known so well, the buyer pardons a mistake of up to a sixth;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>More than a sixth, one knows that it is wrong, so it is a totally mistaken sale. (Similar reasoning applies if it is worth too little.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a worker accepted to plant trees in Reuven's field, Reuven must accept 10 trees of every 100 that do not bear fruit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If more than this do not bear fruit; the worker must replace all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> If more than this do not bear fruit; it is as if the worker comes to plant a field from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SELLING A WINE CELLAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he sold a wine cellar...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case? No matter what he said, this is difficult!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If Reuven said 'I sell to you <i>a</i> wine cellar', all the wine must be good;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he said 'I sell to you <i>this</i> wine cellar', the wine must be fit to sell in a store;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he said 'I sell to you <i>a cellar</i>', even if it is all vinegar, the sale stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Really, he said 'I sell to you <i>a</i> wine cellar';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Reisha of the Beraisa should say 'the buyer accepts 10 bad barrels out of every 100.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they did not specify, the buyer need not accept bad barrels!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> R. Chiya taught that if one said 'I sell to you a barrel of wine', all the wine must be good.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A single barrel is different, for all the wine is the same quality.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rav Zvid - Beraisa #2):</span> If one said 'I sell to you a wine cellar', all the wine must be good;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he said 'I sell to you <i>this</i> wine cellar', all the wine must be good, but the buyer accepts 10 bad barrels out of every 100.</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>This is the cellar of our Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he said 'I sell to you <i>this</i> wine cellar'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beraisa #1 says that (when he said '<i>this</i> wine cellar') the wine must be fit to sell in a store. Beraisa #2 says that it must be good!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In Beraisa #2 he sold '(<i>this</i> wine cellar) to use for cooking', so the wine must be good (so it will last a long time), and the buyer accepts 10 bad barrels out of every 100;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Beraisa #1 he did not say 'for cooking', so it suffices that it can be sold in a store.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he said 'I sell to you <i>a</i> wine cellar' and did not say 'for cooking, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha or Ravina):</span> The buyer accepts (10 bad barrels out of every 100).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of Rav Acha and Ravina):</span> The buyer need not accept.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first opinion learns from Beraisa #2. When he said 'I sell to you <i>a</i> wine cellar', all the wine must be good. We established the case to be that he said 'for cooking';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he not said 'for cooking', he would have to accept bad barrels.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The latter opinion learns from Beraisa #1. When he said 'I sell to you <i>a</i> wine cellar', all the wine must be good;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We established the case to be when he did not say 'for cooking'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beraisa #1 refutes the first opinion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated. It means as follows (all the wine must be good) - this is when he said 'for cooking Had he not said 'for cooking', he would have to accept bad barrels.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'I sell to you <i>this</i> wine cellar' and did not say 'for cooking', it suffices that it is fit to sell in a store.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beraisa #2 is difficult for the latter opinion!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We established it when he said 'for cooking.' Had he not said 'for cooking', he would have to accept bad barrels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, even had he not said 'for cooking', he would not have to accept bad barrels;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We established it to be when he said 'for cooking' to resolve the contradiction (with Beraisa #1) in the case of '<i>this</i> wine cellar'.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BAD WINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One blesses Borei Peri ha'Gafen on wine fit to sell in a store.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> That is bad wine! One blesses on it sheha'Kol (Nihyeh bi'Dvaro).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One blesses sheha'Kol on moldy bread, on wine that became Koses (slimy), and on a cooked dish that spoiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Zvid):</span> Rav Yehudah admits regarding very bad wine that is sold only at the crossroads.</p>
