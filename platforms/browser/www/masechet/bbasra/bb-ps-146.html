<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE POOR SUFFER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Why does it say "Kol Yemei Oni Ra'im"? He eats well on Shabbos and Yom Tov (we distribute Tzedakah to the poor then)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even Shabbos and Yom Tov are bad for him, like Shmuel taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A change from one's normal diet prompts (intestinal) sickness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Sefer ben Sira):</span> "<i>Kol</i> Yemei Oni Ra'im" includes the nights. His roof is lower than the others, and rainwater falls onto his roof and drips inside;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His vineyard is the highest. Its soil gets washed onto others' vineyards.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN ARE <i>SAVLONOS</i> RETURNED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sent Savlonos to his father-in-law's house, even if he sent 10,000 Dinarim and he ate there only one meal worth a Dinar, he does not get anything back (even if there will be no Nisu'in, e.g. one of them died or he decided to divorce her);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he never ate there, he gets back what he sent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he sent much Savlonos (and stipulated that it is) in order that she bring them to him at the time of Nisu'in), he gets back what he sent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he sent a small amount for her to use in her father's house, he does not get them back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava):</span> This is only if he ate a Dinar's worth. If he ate less, he gets back what he sent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious. The Mishnah says 'a Dinar'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the same applies even if he ate less than a Dinar's worth, and the Mishnah gave a typical case. Rava teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> The Mishnah says 'if he <i>ate</i>', he does not get anything back. If he drank, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah says 'if <i>he</i> ate...'. If his messenger ate, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah says 'if he ate <i>there</i>'. If they sent food for him and he ate it elsewhere, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and question against Rava - Rav Yehudah):</span> A case occurred in which Shimon sent 100 wagons of wine and oil, Kelim of gold and silver, and silk garments. He came to the door, and they gave to him a cup of hot water. He drank it outside. He died before the Nisu'in. The Chachamim in Usha ruled that those gifts that normally would not last (until the Nisu'in, e.g. wine) are not returned. Gifts that normally would last (e.g. gold and silver Kelim) are returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that even if he drank, and even if he consumed less than a Dinar, the gifts are not returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for Rava - Rav Ashi):</span> Perhaps a gem worth 1000 Dinarim was ground up into the water (this is sometimes done for a cure).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The episode teaches that even if they sent food for him and he ate it elsewhere, the gifts are not returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps eating at the door to his father-in-law's house is like eating in the house.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW MUCH <i>SAVLONOS</i> ARE RETURNED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (If he ate for a Dinar, Savlonos are not returned.) If he ate for part of a Dinar (e.g. a third), do we say that the corresponding portion (a third) of the Savlonos are not returned?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (When Savlonos must be returned,) if they increased in value, is the increased value returned?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since if they are intact, they themselves are returned, it is as if the Chasan's property increased in value;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since if they are lost or stolen she must return their value, it is as if her property increased in value?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>These questions are unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If Savlonos that normally do not last, happened to last, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav Yehudah taught... Chachamim in Usha ruled that gifts that normally do not last are not returned. Gifts that normally last are returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Gifts that normally do not last are not returned, even if they happened to last!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Only if they wore out, then they are not returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> If he sent a small amount of Savlonos for her to use in her father's house, he does not get them back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> This refers to kerchiefs (they are inexpensive, and the Chasan pardons them. We cannot learn to expensive gifts).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A case occurred in which a Chasan sent to his father-in-law new wine, new oil and new linen garments at Shavu'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This teaches the praise of Eretz Yisrael (he was able to harvest new fruits before Shavu'os).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If a Chasan will make such a claim (that he sent new wine... at Shavu'os), we do not say that surely he is lying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A case occurred in which people told a Chasan that his wife cannot smell (this is a blemish, it invalidates the Kidushin). He entered a ruin with her, and said 'I smell a radish in Galil.'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">146b----------------------------------------146b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">His wife:</span> If only someone would give me dates of Yericho, I would eat them! (Some say that she smelled that he had dates with him, and answered him jokingly.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The ruin collapsed, and she died. Chachamim ruled that since he was testing her, he does not inherit her. (Rashbam - she was fully married to him. He intended to divorce her if he finds that she cannot smell. R. Tam - she was only Mekudeshes, and he owned the ruin. Since he brought her there only to test her, this is not Nisu'in, so he does not inherit her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he sent a small amount of Savlonos for her to use in her father's house...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin Sava):</span> Whether he or she died or he retracted, the gifts are returned. Food and drink are not returned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she retracted, even bundles of vegetables are returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>When returning (money in place of) food, we evaluate meat according to the cheaper price.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a third less than what it sells for on the market day.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MATNAS SHECHIV MERA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Shechiv Mera gave away all his property and retained any amount of land for himself, he cannot retract (it is like a gift of a healthy person);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he did not keep land for himself, he can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah, who follows estimation (of one's intention, that he gave all his property only because he did not expect to live)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> It is R. Shimon ben Menasiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven went overseas, and his father heard that Reuven died, and wrote all his property to others, and later Reuven returned, the gift stands;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Menasiya says, the gift is void. Had he known that his son was alive, he would not have given it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> It is R. Shimon Shezuri.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> At first, they used to say that if one was being led to his execution and said 'write a Get to my wife', we write and give it (surely, he wanted us to give it. He forgot to say this because he was distracted);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Later, they said that this applies also to one who is boarding a ship to go overseas or leaving with a caravan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon Shezuri says, this applies also to a Shechiv Mera.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav Nachman establish our Mishnah like R. Shimon Shezuri?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, he said 'write' (which shows that he wants to divorce her. Here, he did not say anything showing that the gift was conditional).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav Sheshes establish our Mishnah like R. Shimon ben Menasiya?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, certainly, had he known that his son was alive, he would not have given to someone else. Here, it is not so certain that the gift was conditional.</p>
