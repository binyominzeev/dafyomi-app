<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>VAGUE EXPRESSIONS IN A DOCUMENT (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that 'gold <i>b'</i>Dinarim' means at least two silver Dinarim worth of gold. Perhaps he meant a gold ingot worth two gold Dinarim!!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The bearer of the document has the lower hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should say the same in the Reisha! (When it says 'Kesef <i>b'</i>Dinarim', why does he get two gold Dinarim worth of Kesef? The bearer should have the lower hand!) (text of Maharshal)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> There, it says <i>Dinari</i> (which connotes gold Dinarim). Here it says Dinari<i>m</i> (this can refer to gold or silver.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to distinguish these expressions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If on five occasions, Leah had a doubt if she must bring a Korban for her miscarriage (or Zivah (non-menstrual blood)), once she brings one Korban (two birds), she may eat Kodshim. She is obligated to bring the rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once, in Yerushalayim, pairs of birds were selling for Dinari of gold. R. Shimon ben Gamliel resolved to cause the price to drop to <i>Dinarim</i>. He expounded in Beis Din that she brings one Korban, she may eat Kodshim, and she need <i>not</i> bring the rest. The price plummeted to a quarter of a (silver Dinar).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A DISCREPANCY IN A DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it says above...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We can learn one erased letter of the bottom from the top, but not two. E.g. if the bottom says 'Chanan' and the top says 'Chanani', we learn from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, we cannot learn two letters, because sometimes this is half the name (when the name has four letters);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also we should not learn one letter, for sometimes this is half the name, i.e. when the name has two letters!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we cannot learn two letters, because sometimes this is most of the name (when the name has three letters).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If above it says 'Sefel' (Rashbam - bowl), and below it says 'Kefel' (a doubled garment), we follow the bottom (it is less. Tosfos - 'SeFeL' stands for 'Samech PaLgei (60 halves)'; alternatively, Se'ah v'PaLga (a Se'ah and a half). 'Kefel' stands for 'Kuf (100) Palgei', or Kav and a half.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If it says 'Kefel' above and 'Sefel' below, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Do we follow the bottom, or) do we suspect that the 'Samech' was really a 'Kuf', and some of the ink was moved by a fly?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This question is not resolved. (Therefore, the bearer of the document has the lower hand. He collects according to 'Sefel'.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AN AMBIGUOUS EXPRESSION IN A DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sharbiya):</span> If a document says '600 and a Zuz', does this mean '600 Sela'im and a Zuz', or (could it mean) '600 Perutos and a Zuz'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> One would not write (a large number of) Perutos in a document. He would give the value in Zuzim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Chananel):</span> He collects 600 (common) Sela'im (each is one eighth silver, i.e. half a Zuz) and a Zuz, because the bearer of a document has the lower hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> We do not know if '600' refers to Sela'im (each is four Zuzim) or Zuzim (Rashbam - these coins are pure silver; Ramah - they are common). The bearer of the document has the lower hand (he gets 601 Zuzim).</p>
