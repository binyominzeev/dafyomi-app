<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MEASURING OUT PART OF THE SALE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav and Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> One may not hire a worker for a Dinar per day of work to be done later, if the normal wage is a Sela per day (the discount looks like Ribis);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he hires him to begin now, and pays immediately (e.g. 100 Dinarim for 100 days of work), it is permitted, even though the normal wages at the end of the job will be more;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If when one sells 'a Kor for 30, each Se'ah for a Sela', after each Se'ah is measured out, it is acquired (but either can retract about the rest), here also, at any time he need not finish the job. He works the last days for a lower wage because he was paid in advance. It should be forbidden (like in the Reisha)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We are never concerned for one who works for a small wage! (Often, if one has no food to eat, he accepts to work for less than the normal wages. Therefore, it does not look like Ribis.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it forbidden in the Reisha of the Beraisa, but not in the Seifa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>In the Reisha, he is paid before he starts working, so it <i>looks like</i> Ribis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Seifa, he starts working immediately, so it does not look like Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it was attached to the ground and he detached any amount, he acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he acquire everything by detaching any amount?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The case is, the seller said 'go make any improvement in the field and acquire it all.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SELLING LIQUIDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sells wine or oil to Shimon, and the price went up or down: before the measure is filled, the wine still belongs to Reuven; after the measure is filled, the wine belongs to Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a middleman was selling and the barrel broke, he suffers the loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He must hold the bottle (after the wine or oil stops flowing) until three drops come out;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After this, if he tilted the bottle and some drops accumulated, they belong to Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A grocer need not wait for three drops;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, just before Shabbos he need not wait.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (In the Reisha,) who owns the measuring Kli?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon owns it, before the measure is filled, the wine should belong to Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Reuven owns it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, after the measure is filled, the wine should still be Reuven's!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Ila'i):</span> It belongs to a middleman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The next clause says that if a middleman was selling, if the barrel broke, he suffers the loss. This implies that the Reisha does not discuss a middleman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha discusses the Kli of a middleman. In the next clause, the middleman himself was selling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> After this, if he tilted the bottle and some drops accumulated, they belong to Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Elazar - Mishnah):</span> (If one declared a bottle of wine to be Terumah,) if he tilted the bottle (after pouring it out) and some drops accumulated, they are Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">87b----------------------------------------87b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> Here, they belong to Reuven because Shimon despairs (of getting any more) after the three drops.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A grocer need not wait for three drops. (R. Yehudah says, just before Shabbos he need not wait).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yehudah argue with the Reisha (that always obligates a regular person), and he is lenient just before Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, does R. Yehudah argue with this clause (that always exempts a grocer), and he is stringent (except for just before Shabbos)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Just before Shabbos, a grocer need not wait, because he is very busy.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ENTRUSTING OBJECTS OF VALUE TO A MINOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sent his son (a minor, with a coin worth two Isarim) to a grocer (Shimon), who gave to him an Isar worth of oil and an Isar change, and the child broke the flask and lost the Isar, Shimon is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah exempts him, for he did like Reuven wanted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim agree that if the child held the flask and Shimon measured into it, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We understand the argument about the Isar and the oil. Chachamim say that the child was sent to <i>inform</i> Shimon to send (the oil and Isar) with an adult, and R. Yehudah says that he wanted Shimon to send them with the child;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, why do Chachamim obligate him for the flask? Reuven knowingly gave it to his son (who is prone to break it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Hoshaya):</span> The case is, Reuven sells flasks. Shimon picked it up to see if he wants to buy it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one takes a Kli from a craftsman to see if he wants to buy it, and Ones occurred, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, Shmuel's law is like Chachamim, but not like R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> The case is, Shimon sells flasks (it was his flask). They argue about the flask like they argue about the Isar and oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> Chachamim agree that if the child held the flask and Shimon measured into it, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon was supposed to send the oil with an adult, why is he exempt? (Tosfos - Rabah and Rav Yosef explain that in the Seifa, Reuven sent his son with a flask. The Gemara does not accept this.)</p>
