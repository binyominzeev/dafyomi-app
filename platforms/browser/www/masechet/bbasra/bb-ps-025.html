<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DISTANCING DAMAGERS FROM A CITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>We must distance Neveilos, graves and tanneries 50 Amos from the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A tannery may only be made to the east of the city;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says, it may be made in any direction except for the west, and he must distance 50 Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We must distance a soaking pit from (his neighbor's) vegetables, and leeks from onions, and mustard from bees;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yosi permits mustard near bees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does R. Akiva say?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he permit a tannery adjacent to the city in any direction except for the west, and he requires 50 Amos if it is in the west?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does he require 50 Amos in the other directions, but the west is always forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> One may make a tannery 50 Amos from the city in any direction except for the west;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The west is always forbidden. It is constant.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The west wind blows more often than the other directions.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Chanan bar Aba taught that all four winds blow every day. The north wind blows with each one, the world could not survive without this;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The south wind is the harshest. A certain angel contains it. If it did not, it would destroy the world.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE FOUR DIRECTIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The west constantly hosts the Shechinah (Divine Presence);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> We must be grateful to our ancestors (Anshei Keneses ha'Gedolah), for they taught us the direction to pray in - "u'Tzva ha'Shomayim Lecha Mishtachavim" (the sun, moon and stars travel westward).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> Perhaps the Shechinah is in the east. The sun, moon and stars bow to His Presence while departing, like a servant who walks (backwards) away from his master!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Oshaya holds that the Shechinah is everywhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> "Atah Hu Hash-m Levadecha" - Your messengers are unlike a human's messengers!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When one sends a messenger, the messenger later returns to where he was sent from;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>When Hash-m sends a messenger, the messenger need not return (wherever he goes, Hash-m is there) - "ha'Sishalach... v'Yelechu v'Yomeru Lecha Hinenu" (the messenger reports back to Hash-m at the place he goes to).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Also R. Yishmael holds that the Shechinah is everywhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Ha'Mal'ach...Yotzei u'Mal'ach Acher Yotzei Likraso" - it does not say that another angel is sent after the first, rather he goes to greet him;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Hash-m can send the second angel from the place the first angel was heading towards, because the Shechinah is everywhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Also Rav Sheshes holds that the Shechinah is everywhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Rav Sheshes was blind.) He told his servant 'you can point me in any direction to pray, except for eastwards.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Shechinah is also in the east, Rav Sheshes did not want to pray eastwards because Minim pray eastwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Avahu holds that the Shechinah is in the west.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> (In Persian, west is) 'URiYaH' - the AviR of KaH (Hash-m. Alternatively, 'Uriyah' means east,) - the Avir that Kah faces.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Ya'arof ka'Matar Likchi" refers to the west wind, which comes from the Oref (strength, i.e. the place of the Shechinah. Alternatively, the back) of the world;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Tizal ka'Tal Imrasi" refers to the north wind, which (brings heat and famine, which raises the price of food and) Mazeles (cheapens) gold;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Ki'Se'iRim Alei Deshe" refers to the east wind, which is MeSa'eRes (agitates) the entire world like a Sa'ir (goat);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Vechi'Rvivim Alei Esev" refers to the south wind, which brings Revivim (rain) and makes Asavim (herbs) grow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The world is like a three-walled building; the north side is not covered;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The sun traverses the other three directions. When it reaches the northwest corner, it goes above the Raki'a (and goes eastward overnight, and rises in the northeast in the morning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Yehoshua says, the world is like a tent, the north side is covered;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the sun reaches the northwest corner, it goes (through a window) in back of the tent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Holech El Darom v'Sovev El Tzafon" - the sun (always) travels along the south by day, and circles around the north side by night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Sovev Sovev Holech ha'Ru'ach" - sometimes (i.e. in summer) the sun travels along the east and west by day. Sometimes (i.e. in winter) it circles around the east and west by night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Eliezer says, "umi'Mezarim Karah" refers to the north wind (which is cold, because the north side is exposed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Rochav Mayim b'Mutzak" - this is the east wind.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that the south wind brings rain!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The south wind brings rain gently, the east wind brings gushing rain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> From the day of the Churban, the south wind no longer brings rain - "Va'Yigzor Al Yamin v'Ra'ev";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Tzafon v'Yamin" - this shows that Yamin is south.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rafram bar Papa):</span> From the day of the Churban, rain does not come from Hash-m's good storehouse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Yiftach... Otzaro ha'Tov" - only when Yisrael does Hash-m's will, we dwell in Eretz Yisrael and merit this blessing;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> One who wants to grow wise should face southwards when praying. One who wants to grow rich should face northwards when praying.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A way to remember this is that (in the Heichal) the Menorah was in the south, and the Shulchan was in the north.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> One should always face southwards. Through growing wise, he will grow rich - "Orech Yamim bi'Minah bi'Semolah Osher v'Chavod".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi said that the Shechinah is in the west (so one should face west)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He faces west, and tilts slightly to the south.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina (to R. Yoshiyah):</span> You live (in Bavel), to the north of Eretz Yisrael. You should face southwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Bavel is to the north?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mi'Tzafon Tifasach ha'Ra'ah".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE'S 'ARROWS'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span>  We must distance a soaking pit from (his neighbor's) vegetables, and leeks from onions, and mustard from bees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> One may grow mustard near bees;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The neighbor cannot tell him 'distance your mustard (for it harms my bees)', for he can say back 'distance your bees, for they harm my mustard!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven must distance his tree 25 Amos from Shimon's pit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A carob or sycamore tree must be distanced 50 Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This is whether the tree is on ground above the pit or even with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If (the tree is too close and) the pit was there before the tree, Shimon may cut the tree without compensating Reuven;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the tree was there before the pit, he may not cut the tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yosi says, even if the pit preceded the tree, he may not cut it. Just like Shimon may dig in his own property, Reuven may plant in his own property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> This is whether the tree is above the pit or below it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, if the tree is above the pit, its roots will descend and damage the pit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if the tree is below, what is the problem?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chaga):</span> The roots spread to underneath the pit and harm the soil there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> Even if the pit preceded the tree, he may not cut it. Just like Shimon may dig in his own property, Reuven may plant in his own property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> R. Yosi admits regarding Girei Dilei (his arrows, i.e. damage that comes directly from the person's hand).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Papa Yona'ah was a poor man who became wealthy; he built a house. There were people in his neighborhood who pressed sesame to make oil; this caused his house to shake.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> R. Yosi admits regarding Girei Dilei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much must the house shake to obligate the pressers to distance themselves?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is so much that if a Keli is on the wall (Rashi; Ri - if one holds a Keli), its cover will shake.</p>
