<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS INCLUDED WHEN TREES ARE SOLD?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the trees grew, Shimon may not cut the branches... (Reuven owns what grows from the stump, and Shimon owns what grows from the roots).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered from the stump, and what is considered from the roots?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Whatever is above the ground is considered the stump. Whatever is below the ground is considered the roots.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest soil be deposited near the stump, making outgrowths look like independent trees (and the buyer will claim that he bought three trees, and acquired land! Chachamim should have said that the seller may cut the growths!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman and R. Yochanan):</span> Indeed, we cut the growths. The Mishnah teaches only that the wood belongs to Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The law of the stump does not apply to date trees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid):</span> This means that the buyer does not get what grows from the stump. Since it will be uprooted when it dies, he does not hope to get anything from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> If Reuven buys two trees, he gets what grows from the stumps, even though they will be uprooted when they die!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Rather, he does not get what grows from the stump, because normally nothing grows from date stumps (therefore, he does not hope to get anything).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did Rav Zvid understand the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses one who bought a tree for five years. (If it dies within this time, he may plant a new tree in its place, therefore he expects to benefit from the stump.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW MUCH LAND DOES ONE ACQUIRE WITH TREES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven bought three trees, he acquires land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much land does he acquire?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> He acquires the land under and between them, and the area around them for the harvester and his basket.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">82b----------------------------------------82b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> The buyer does not own a path to his trees (according to Chachamim, who say that one sells stingily). All the more so he does not get land around them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The seller does not give a path, for this is different land. He does give area around them; it goes with the land between them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> According to R. Elazar, if Reuven bought two trees, (he does not acquire the land between them, but) he acquires a path to them. (Rashbam - just like Shimon lets Reuven use the land they are on, he also allows use of a path; Tosfos - R. Elazar holds that it is more reasonable to get a path than the surrounding land. When Reuven buys two trees, he acquires the surrounding land. Shimon cannot cut them if they grow!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven can say 'they are on your land!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Elazar argues with Shmuel, his Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Akiva, who says that one sells generously.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> No. R. Elazar explains our Mishnah, which cannot be like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't the Mishnah be like R. Akiva?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says that if the trees grew, Shimon may cut the branches;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Akiva, one sells generously, so Shimon may not cut the branches!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Akiva said that Shimon sells generously only regarding a pit and cistern, for these do not damage his land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He would not say that he sells generously regarding a tree, for (if it is not pruned) it will damage his land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Chiya bar Aba - Beraisa):</span> He acquires the land under and between them, and the area around them for the harvester and his basket</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Who has the right to seed the area (needed to harvest) around the trees? (Does the buyer totally own them, or only for needs of harvesting?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> (If Levi owns a garden inside Yehudah's garden, and may use a path to his garden,) Yehudah has the right to seed the path.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> There is different, for Levi does not lose if Yehudah seeds the path;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, if Shimon seeds the surrounding area, Reuven's fruit will get dirty (when it falls)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye - Seifa of that Mishnah):</span> If Levi received a path on the side (of Yehudah's garden), neither may seed it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Abaye - Beraisa):</span> He acquires the land under and between them, and the area around them needed for the harvester and his basket. Neither may sow the surrounding area.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SPACING OF THE TREES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What must be the spacing between the trees in order that Reuven acquires land?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef citing Shmuel):</span> It must be between four and eight Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava citing Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> It must be between eight and 16 Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Yosef - Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If rows of a vineyard are 16 Amos apart, one may seed other things in between;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> A case occurred in which a man spaced the rows of his vineyard 16 Amos apart. He would lean the vines of rows one and two towards each other, and also of rows three and four,... and sow in the spaces not covered by vines (between two and three, between four and five,...);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The next year, he would lean the vines to where he sowed the previous year (between two and three,...), and sow where the vines were leaning the previous year (between one and two,...)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim approved of this. (It was permitted only because he leaned the vines away, to leave 16 Amos in between rows of vines. If it were less than 16, the rows would join, and he would need to distance like from a vineyard!)</p>
