<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS ONE WHO TAKES AND RETURNS SOMETHING RESPONSIBLE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye bar Avin and R. Chanina bar Avin):</span> The case is, Shimon took the flask to measure (the oil for Reuven) with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If an animal was lost, and a Chacham (who is exempt from returning it, for it is beneath his dignity) hit it (to make it return by itself), he is responsible to return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rabah said so about an animal. Once it strays, it is less likely to return home;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We have no source that using a flask (for the sake of Reuven) obligates him to return it to Reuven!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava and R. Zeira):</span> The case is, Shimon took the flask to measure with it for others.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah holds that one who borrows without permission is like a borrower, it suffices to return it to where he took it from (the child);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that one who borrows without permission is like a robber, so he must return it to the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one takes a Kli from a craftsman to see if he wants to buy it, and Ones occurred, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if the price is known.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Levi entered a meat store, and picked up thigh to inspect it. A horseman came and took it; Rav Yemar obligated Levi to pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only because the price was known.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Reuven brought gourds to Fum Nahara to sell. Everyone took one each (intending to buy it. Reuven thought that they were stealing.) He said 'they are Hekdesh!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> One cannot make Hekdesh something that is not his. (The buyers acquired them. They merely owed money.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is only if the price is known. If not, they still belonged to Reuven, and they are now Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Chaver (one who is trustworthy about Ma'aseros) was looking at vegetables to buy them (from Reuven, who is not a Chaver), even for a whole day, he does not acquire (until he decides absolutely), so he need not tithe them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he decided to buy them, he acquires, and he must tithe them.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He may not return them (intact), for they must be tithed (a Chaver may not give or sell Tevel before tithing it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He may not tithe them and return (the rest), for this reduces their value!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>He tithes them and pays to Reuven the value of the Ma'aser (and returns the remaining vegetables).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he acquire and need to tithe them just because he decided to buy them?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Hoshaya):</span> The Beraisa discusses a Heaven-fearing person like Rav Safra, who fulfilled "v'Dover Emes bi'Lvavo" (he fulfilled his intention, even though he did not say a word).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CLEANING ONE'S MEASURES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A wholesaler cleans his measures once every 30 days (because they are used often, much sticks to them);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A regular person (who sells less frequently) cleans his measures once every 12 months;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, just the contrary! (A wholesaler's Kelim are used often, so the remaining drops rarely dry up and stick to the Kelim, so once a year suffices. Others must clean them once every 30 days.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A grocer cleans his measures twice a week, his weights once a week, and his scale after every weighing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, this applies to (Kelim that hold) liquids. For dry things, there is no need to clean the Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">88b----------------------------------------88b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>GIVING EXTRA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The grocer must give enough Peros to be Machri'a (lift the pan holding the weights) a Tefach (above the Peros).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he (is in a place where one) measures evenly, he compensates by adding extra Peros, one part <i>for</i> 10 for liquids, and one <i>for</i> 20 for dry measures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>In a place where people measure with small Kelim, he should not measure with big Kelim (for there will be fewer weighings);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In a place where people measure with big Kelim, he should not measure with small Kelim (the seller cannot make them so even).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>In a place where people sell even measures, he should not give a heaping measure, or vice-versa (we will explain why).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source (that one must make the weights go a Tefach higher)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> "<i>Even</i> Sheleimah va'Tzedek" - give more than the full measure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> In a place where people measure evenly, he compensates by adding extra.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Torah requires Hachra'ah, how can he weigh evenly?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, the Torah does not require Hachra'ah (but where people do so, one must be Machri'a a Tefach);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We asked for the source that in a place where people measure evenly, he compensates by adding extra. Reish Lakish answered that we learn from "Even Sheleimah va'Tzedek."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much extra must one give? (What does it mean 'one part <i>for</i> 10'?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> It is a tenth of a liter for a sale of 10 liters (i.e. one part in 100) for liquids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He adds one part for 10 for liquids, and one for 20 for dry measures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does it mean a tenth of a liter for a sale of 10 liters for liquids, and one part in 20 of a liter for a sale of 20 liters for dry measures?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does it mean, a tenth of a liter for a sale of 10 liters for liquids, or for a sale of 20 liters for dry measures?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT IS MORE SEVERE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> The punishment for false measures is more severe than for incest. Regarding false measures it says "El", regarding incest it says "Eleh".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that "El" connotes strength?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Es Elei ha'Aretz Lokach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding incest it says "Eleh", which also connotes severity!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, "Eleh" teaches that Kares (applies to Arayos, but it) does not apply to false measures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since Kares applies to Arayos but not to false measures, why are false measures considered more stringent?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One can repent after sinning with Arayos, but not after sinning with false measures (he does not remember to whom he owes money).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> The punishment for stealing from a person is worse than for stealing from Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding stealing from a person, the Torah says "Chet", before (he benefited, i.e.) "Me'ilah". Regarding stealing from Hekdesh, it does not say "Chet" until after "Me'ilah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> Hash-m acts unlike people: Hash-m blessed Yisrael with 22 letters (from Aleph to Tav - "<i>I</i>m Bechukosai Telechu... Komemiyu<i>s</i>") and cursed them with eight (from Vov to Mem, "<i>v</i>'Im Bechukosai Tim'asu... Go'alah Nafsha<i>m</i>")</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moshe blessed Yisrael with eight letters, "<i>v</i>'Hayah Im Shamo'a... l'Avda<i>m</i>", and cursed them with 22, "<i>v</i>'Hayah Im Lo Sishma... v'Ein Kone<i>h</i>."</p>
