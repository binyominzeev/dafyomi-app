<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA BASRA 150 - A week of learning has been dedicated towards meriting a Refu'ah Sheleimah for Eliezer Lipa ben Yetta, by Mr. and Mrs. Kornfeld of Yerushalayim. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS THE WORDING OF OUR MISHNAH PRECISE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> That Mishnah says 'land' only for parallel structure to the Reisha;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reisha - R. Akiva):</span> The following apply to any amount of land: one must leave Pe'ah (a corner for the poor, and he does not harvest it), one must bring from it (to a Kohen in the Mikdash) Bikurim (first fruits of the seven species), one may write on it a Pruzbul (a document saying that he hands over his debts to Beis Din, so Shemitah will not cancel them), and one may acquire Metaltelim Agav (with) it by acquiring the land through money, a document or Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (part 2, to Objection 2:f, 149b - Abaye):</span> Sometimes a Mishnah says 'any amount', but a certain amount is required!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Dosa ben Hurkanus):</span> One must give (to a Kohen) Reishis ha'Gez (first shearings of his sheep) only if he shears from each of five sheep a Maneh (the weight of 9600 barley seeds) and a half of wool.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he is liable for any amount at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim say 'any amount.' How much is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> It is a Maneh and a half. Each sheep must yield a fifth of this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> There, it says 'any amount' to contrast with R. Dosa, who requires a large amount.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ARE SLAVES CONSIDERED LIKE LAND?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The following is obvious. If Reuven said 'my Metaltelim are to Ploni', he acquires all Reuven's Kelim, except for wheat and barley (Rashbam - and animals);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said '<i>all</i> my Metaltelim', Ploni acquires even wheat and barley and the upper millstone, but not the lower millstone;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'everything that can be moved', he even acquires the lower millstone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is a slave considered like land or Metaltelim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Avya - Mishnah):</span> If one sells a city, this includes the houses, pits, bathhouses, dovecotes, olivepresses and Beis ha'Shelachin (even if it is outside the city);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Metaltelim are not included;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'it and everything inside', even animals and slaves are included.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> If slaves are Metaltelim, we understand why they are excluded (in the Reisha). However, if slaves are like land, why are they excluded?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If they are Metaltelim, why does it say (in the Seifa) '<i>even</i> animals and slaves'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You must say that Metaltelim that move (by themselves) are different than Metaltelim that do not move;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Likewise, we can say that slaves are like land that moves. They are different than land that does not move (therefore, they are not sold with the city)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven wrote all his property to his slave, the slave goes free;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven kept any amount of land, the slave is not free.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, in either case he is free, unless Reuven wrote 'all my property is to my slave, except for one part in 10,000.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi bar Yosef):</span> Keeping Metaltelim is like keeping land regarding a slave, but not regarding a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The reason is, slaves are like Metaltelim, so keeping Metaltelim affects (freeing) slaves (it suggests that he also kept part of the slave);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Kesuvah is like land, so receiving Metaltelim is not like receiving part of her Kesuvah (to show that she pardons her lien).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">150b----------------------------------------150b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> No (keeping Metaltelim does not suggest that he kept also part of the slave);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the slave does not go free, because this is not Kerisus (the Get of freedom must totally sever (the slave) from the master. Here, the Get of freedom also mentions something (Metaltelim) that the master keeps.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LAWS THAT DEPEND ON GIVING AWAY ALL THAT ONE OWNS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> There are five laws that apply only if one gave away all his property. They pertain to a Shechiv Mera, a slave, a wife, sons, and a gift to evade.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Matnas Shechiv Mera - (Mishnah):</span> If a Shechiv Mera gave away all his property and retained a small amount of land for himself, he cannot retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he did not keep land for himself, he can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Freeing a slave - (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven wrote all his property to his slave, the slave goes free;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Reuven kept any amount of land, the slave is not free.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">A wife - (Rav Yehudah):</span> If a man wrote a document giving all his property to his wife, he only made her an overseer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Sons - (Mishnah):</span> If Shimon wrote his property to his sons and gave to his wife any amount of land, she forfeits her (lien on this land given to the sons to collect her) Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Mavrachas [an evasion document. If a woman with property is about to marry and does not want her husband to get her property, she writes her property to someone else.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Surely, she does not give away all her property. The gift is totally void.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question (Beriasa - Chachamim):</span> If she did not stipulate 'I will take it back when I want', the receiver can keep it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> The Beraisa discusses one who kept some of her property. Shmuel taught that] Mavrachas is invalid only if she gave all her property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> In all cases, if one kept Metaltelim, it is not as if he gave everything, except for a Kesuvah, for Chachamim enacted that it is collected from land, and not from Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> If a man gave all his property to his sons except for Metaltelim (that were designated to pay the Kesuvah), she does not forfeit her (lien on his property to collect her) Kesuvah. (Since she expects to collect it from the Metaltelim, she sees no need to protest about the land.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT IS CALLED PROPERTY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If Shimon said '<i>Nichsai</i> (my property) is to Ploni', this includes slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven wrote all his property to his slave, the slave goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Land is called 'property';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Property with Acharayus (there is compensation if it is legally taken from the buyer, i.e. land) is acquired through money, a document or Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A garment is called 'property';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Property that has no Acharayus (i.e. Metaltelim) is only acquired through Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Money is called 'property';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Property that has no Acharayus is acquired with (Agav) land, through money, a document or Chazakah (on the land).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Papa had 12,000 Dinarim in Bei Chuza'i; he gave them to Rav Shmuel bar Acha, Agav the corner of his house, in order that the watchman would give to them to Rav Shmuel (to return to Rav Papa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A document is called 'property';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Yitzchak):</span> There are two laws of documents:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the seller said 'acquire the field for Ploni (e.g. Chalipin) and write the document', he can retract his authorization of a document, but not the gift (the people present acquired immediately for Ploni);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he said 'acquire the field for him on condition that you write the document', he can retract the document and the gift (until Ploni receives the document).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> There is a third law, if the seller wrote the document in the buyer's absence;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A seller may write the document in the buyer's absence.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>When the buyer makes Chazakah on the field, he acquires the document, wherever it is, as we learned in a Mishnah:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Property without Acharayus (liability to compensate the buyer if the property is legally taken from him; here, it refers to the document) can be acquired Agav land, through money, a document or Chazakah.</p>
