<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE BUYER'S KELIM IN THE SELLER'S PREMISES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven's donkey-drivers or workers were carrying Peros, and Shimon (who wants to buy) took the workers into his house, if they were Posek (set the price) <i>or</i> measured the Peros (but not both), either party can retract. (Taking workers into one's house is not Meshichah (while they are laden with the Peros). Both Meshichah and Pesikah are needed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven or Shimon unloaded it and brought it into Shimon's house:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they were Posek, even if they did not measure, neither party can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If they measured but were not Posek, either party can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he set the price after measuring, either party can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Just like the seller's Kelim do not acquire in the buyer's premises (i.e. the Peros are still in the seller's Kelim, yet they do not prevent the buyer from acquiring through his premises), also the buyer's Kelim do not acquire in the seller's premises!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The merchandise was dumped onto the floor of the buyer's premises. It was not unloaded into Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> You cannot say so. The Beraisa does not say 'dumped'. It says 'unloaded'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> The merchandise was bundles of garlic, which are not put into Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Huna brei d'Mar Zutra):</span> Once it is in the buyer's premises, once the seller wants the buyer to acquire, he should acquire, even without setting the price!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Until they set the price, neither decides absolutely.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Ravina):</span> Rav and Shmuel taught that the buyer's Kelim acquire for him <i>everywhere</i>... (except for in a Reshus ha'Rabim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It includes the seller's premises.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, the seller told him to acquire. (It is as if the seller lent his premises to the buyer in order to acquire.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MESHICHAH OF THINGS THAT CAN BE LIFTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Land is acquired through money, a document or Chazakah. Metaltelim are acquired only through Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda or Rav Kahana or Rava):</span> That applies only to things that are not normally lifted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Things that are normally lifted are acquired through Hagbahah, but not Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Masnah - Beraisa):</span> If one steals a wallet on Shabbos, he must pay. He is liable for stealing (from the moment he picked it up) before he is liable for desecrating Shabbos (when he takes it to the Reshus ha'Rabim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was dragging it out, he need not pay, for the liabilities come at the same time. (Since he is liable to die, he need not pay.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though a wallet can be lifted, he acquires it through Meshichah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The case is, the wallet has a rope on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada):</span> I agree that he drags it by a rope, but still, it is normal to lift it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> I meant that the wallet is very heavy, so it is normally dragged by a rope.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> In the seller's premises, he does not acquire until he does Hagbahah or takes it out of the premises.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The item can be lifted, and it can be acquired through Hagbahah or Meshichah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The Beraisa teaches together the laws of two different cases: something normally lifted is acquired through Hagbahah, and something not normally lifted is acquired through Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">86b----------------------------------------86b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Shimon bought Peros and he did Meshichah but did not measure it, he acquires;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Peros can be lifted, yet he acquires through Meshichah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses great loads that cannot be lifted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If Shimon buys flax from Reuven, he does not acquire until he moves it from place to place (i.e. Hagbahah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also flax can be sold in great loads!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Flax is slippery. (Rashbam - therefore, people do not make big loads of it; R. Chananel - therefore, even a big load is not usually dragged, therefore Hagbahah acquires it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Mishnah - R. Meir and R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> A large animal is acquired through Mesirah. A small animal is acquired through Hagbahah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, a small animal is acquired through Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though it can be lifted, it is acquired through Meshichah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A small animal digs its claws in the dirt (Rashbam; R. Chananel - scratches), therefore it is hard to lift.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MEASURING OUT PART OF THE SALE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> If Reuven sold to Shimon 'a Kor (of grain) for 30 (Sela'im)', either can retract until all is measured out;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'a Kor for 30, each Se'ah for a Sela', after each Se'ah is measured out, neither can retract (the sale of that Se'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If the measure belongs to one of them, the buyer acquires every amount as it enters the Kli;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Each amount is acquired, even though the Kli is not full!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he said 'a Hin for 12, each Log for a Sela';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Kahana taught that that the Hin measure in the Mikdash had notches to denote how many Lugim are inside. Likewise, this measure had notches!</p>
