<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO CAN RETRACT FROM A SALE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Chisda):</span> If Levi sold to Yehudah something worth five (e.g. Zuz) for six, and its value increased to eight, Yehudah can retract, but Levi cannot, since Yehudah was overcharged;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yehudah can say 'had you not overcharged me, you could not retract. Now that you overcharged me, can you retract?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sold good wheat, and it was found to be bad, Shimon can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If Levi sold something worth six for five, and its value decreased to three, Levi can retract, but Yehudah cannot, since Levi was underpaid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He can say 'had you not underpaid me, you could not retract. Now that you underpaid me, can you retract?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sold bad wheat, and it was found to be good, Reuven can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rav Chisda teach that we do not know from the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that either can retract in Rav Chisda's case (when the price was too high or low);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah is when the price is correct, but the quality was not as stated;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> When he sold good and it was found to be bad, Reuven cannot retract, because Shimon can say that there was no mistake. "Ra Ra Yomar ha'Koneh" (the buyer always claims that the merchandise is bad, even if he knows that it is not, and likewise, the seller always claims that it is good).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ri):</span> When he sold good and it was found to be bad, the Mishnah teaches that Shimon can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One might have thought that Reuven can say that there was no mistake, for "Ra Ra..." (you knew that the seller always claims that the merchandise is good, even when it is not).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE COLOR OF THE SUN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He sold Shechamtis (wheat), and it was found to be white...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Papa):</span> Since it was <i>found</i> to be white, this teaches that (Shechamtis is red (the only other color of wheat. It is called SheCHAMtis, for it looks like the Chamah (sun), i.e.) the sun is red.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> The sun appears red in the morning and evening;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It does not appear so the rest of the day because our eyes cannot see so clearly because it is so bright.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "The appearance (of Tzara'as) Amok Min ha'Or" is like the sun appears, deeper than the shade.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tzara'as appears white!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like the sun appears regarding deepness, but not regarding color (really, the sun is red).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The one who asked the question understood that the sun is white. How did he understand why it appears red in the morning and evening?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the morning its rays pass through the roses of Gan Eden; in the evening, its rays pass through the entrance of Gehinom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say, vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WINE IN PLACE OF VINEGAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he sold wine, and it was found to be vinegar, either can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is like Rebbi, and unlike Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">84b----------------------------------------84b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Wine and vinegar are the same species;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says, they are two species.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Mishnah is even like Chachamim. Chachamim consider them to be one species only regarding Ma'aser and Terumah, like R. Ila'i;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila'i):</span> If one separates bad Peros to be Terumah on good Peros, it takes effect - "v'Lo Sis'u Alav Chet ba'Harimechem Es Chelbo";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it did not take effect, he would not bear sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding a sale, all agree that some people prefer wine, and others prefer vinegar.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>KINYAN THROUGH MESHICHAH AND MEASURING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sold Peros to Shimon (for a price per unit measure) and he (Shimon) did Meshichah but did not measure it, Shimon acquires;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he measured but did not do Meshichah, he does not acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Shimon is clever, he will rent the premises (to acquire immediately).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Shimon buys flax from Reuven, he does not acquire until he moves it from place to place;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was attached to the ground and he detached any amount, he acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> If he measured and put it in a Simta (an adjunct to a Reshus ha'Rabim where people are permitted to rest things), he acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (R. Zeira):</span> Perhaps you heard that this applies when he measured into his box in the Simta?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Asi):</span> That is obvious. R. Yochanan would not need to teach that case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Zeira accept this answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai (R. Yochanan's Rebbi) citing Rebbi):</span> Partners in a joint Chatzer can acquire one from the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They acquire by putting on the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they acquire by putting in the other's Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (R. Yakov citing R. Yochanan):</span> If he measured and put it in a Simta, he did not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yanai and R. Yochanan (according to Rav Asi) said that he acquires!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that if he puts it in the other's Kli he acquires, if he puts it on the ground he does not acquire (Rav Asi misunderstood R. Yochanan's teaching).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Asi - Mishnah):</span> If he measured but did not do Meshichah, he does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is in a Simta.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is in a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reisha):</span> If he did Meshichah but did not measure it, Shimon acquires;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Meshichah does not acquire in a Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> Mesirah acquires in a Reshus ha'Rabim, or in a Chatzer that does not belong to both of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Meshichah acquires in a Simta or in their joint Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Hagbahah acquires everywhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means, he acquires by doing Meshichah from the Reshus ha'Rabim to a Simta.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If Shimon is clever, he will rent the premises.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>No one owns the Reshus ha'Rabim to rent it to Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means that if he is in a Reshus ha'Yachid, if Shimon is clever, he will rent the premises.</p>
