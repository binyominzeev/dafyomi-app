<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RETRACTING AN OFFER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> Reuven charged Shimon 'you stole my slave', and Shimon denied it, and said 'he is with me because you sold (or gave) him to me', and said 'if you want to swear that he is yours, you may have him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once Reuven swears, Shimon cannot retract his offer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learn this from a Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Levi told Yehudah 'I allow you to use for judges (in our case) my father, or your father, or these three shepherds', Levi can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he cannot retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Aba teaches that they argue in a case that Levi is the defendant (he agreed to pay if the invalid judges will obligate him. All agree that if Levi is the claimant, and agreed to exempt Shimon if the invalid judges will exempt Shimon, Levi cannot retract), and that the Halachah follows Chachamim. (Other Amora'im explain that they argue only when Levi is the claimant.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> The Halachah is, a lender can collect slaves from the borrower's heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> He cannot collect slaves.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>INVALID WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> The Halachah is, a third (generation, i.e. grandson) (of Reuven) can testify about a second (generation of Reuven's brother, i.e. Shimon's son).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A third can even testify about a first (Shimon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> He can even testify about his own grandfather.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Halachah does not follow Mar bar Rav Ashi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> If Levi knew testimony about land, then he became blind, he cannot testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He may testify, e.g. if he knows signs delineating the borders of the land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot testify about a garment,</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> He can even testify about a garment, e.g. if he knows the length and width;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot testify about an ingot (chunk of metal).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> He can even testify about an ingot, e.g. if he knows its weight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven knew testimony about Shimon, then he became Shimon's father-in-law, or deaf, blind, or insane, he cannot testify;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was a valid witness when he saw the testimony, then he became his father-in-law, deaf, blind, or insane, and later became valid again (Reuven's daughter died, so he is no longer related, or he regained his hearing, sight or sanity), he can testify;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The general rule is, if he was an invalid witness at the beginning (when he saw the testimony) or the end (when he wants to testify), he cannot testify. If he was a valid witness at the beginning and at the end, he can testify.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER TEACHINGS OF R. ABA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> If one says (we will explain what) about a child among children, he is believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> R. Aba says that if one says about one of his sons 'he will inherit all my property', he is believed. This is like R. Yochanan ben Brokah (130a);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan says that he is not believed. This is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, why do they say 'believed' and 'not believed'? They should say 'he inherits' or 'he does not inherit'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> R. Aba says that if one says about one of his children 'he is my firstborn', he is believed. This is like R. Yehudah (127b);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan says, he is not believed. This is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> If Reuven says 'my wife will receive a share of my property like one of my sons', this takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> She receives a share of the property that he had when he said this. She receives a share of this (a half or third or quarter...) based on the number of sons he has when he dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> If Shimon brought a loan document against Levi and says that he did not collect any part of it, and Levi says that he paid half, and witnesses testify that he paid it all, Levi swears that he paid half, and Shimon collects half from Levi's free (unsold) property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot collect from what Levi sold, for the buyer can say 'witnesses testified that it was paid!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(If a loan document says 'Sela'im' (this implies at least two), the lender claims five, and the borrower (Yehudah) admits to three, R. Akiva exempts Yehudah from swearing, like a Meshiv Aveidah (one who returns a lost object, for he could have said two). R. Shimon ben Elazar obligates him to take the oath of Modeh b'Miktzas (partial admission).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Only there, R. Akiva considers him like a Meshiv Aveidah, for there are no witnesses. Here, Levi admitted to half due to fear of the witnesses (lest they support Shimon), therefore he must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> Just the contrary! Even R. Shimon ben Elazar obligates swearing Modeh b'Miktzas only there, for witnesses do not support him. Here, witnesses support Levi (he could have denied owing anything), so he is like a Meshiv Aveidah, and he does not swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra citing Rav Ashi):</span> The Halachah follows R. Aba in all these teachings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Rav Nachman argues! (He says that we do not collect from slaves, and the Halachah follows Rav Nachman in monetary laws.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> We learned that also R. Aba said that we do not collect from slaves.</p>
