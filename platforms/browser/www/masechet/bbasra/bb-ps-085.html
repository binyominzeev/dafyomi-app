<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHERE CAN KELIM ACQUIRE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> The buyer's Kelim acquire for him everywhere, except for in a Reshus ha'Rabim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> They acquire even in a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> They do not argue: Rav and Shmuel refer to a proper Reshus ha'Rabim, and R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish refer to a Simta.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they meant a Simta, why did they call it a Reshus ha'Rabim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They call it a Reshus ha'Rabim because it is not a Reshus ha'Yachid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (R. Avahu citing R. Yochanan):</span> The buyer's Kelim acquire anywhere he is allowed to place them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They do not acquire where he may not place them (, i.e. a Reshus ha'Rabim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> There are four laws regarding a sale. Before the measure is full, the merchandise belongs to the seller (this is relevant in case it will spill, the price will change, or one of them wants to retract);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After the measure is full, it belongs to the buyer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is when the measuring Kli belongs to a third party (who lent it to them);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it belongs to one of them, the buyer acquires every amount once it enters the Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is in a Reshus ha'Rabim or a Chatzer that does not belong to either of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In the seller's premises, he does not acquire until he does Hagbahah or takes it out of the premises;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>In the buyer's premises, he acquires as soon as the seller agrees to sell.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>In the premises of Levi (with whom the merchandise was deposited), he does not acquire until Levi agrees that the buyer may use the premises to acquire, or rents the premises to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> It says that in a Reshus ha'Rabim or a Chatzer that does not belong to either of them (the buyer acquires if one of them owns the Kli)!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Beraisa refers to a proper Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it refers to a Simta.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reshus ha'Rabim was taught together with a Chatzer that does not belong to either of them. Presumably, they are similar! (A Simta is different, for each has the right to use it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa refers to a Chatzer that does not belong <i>exclusively</i> to either of them. Rather, it is their joint Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE BUYER'S KELIM IN THE SELLER'S PREMISES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes):</span> Does a buyer acquire with his Kelim in the seller's premises?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna - Mishnah):</span> If a man threw a Get into his wife's garment or basket (in his premises), she is divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> Why did Rav Huna answer from that Mishnah? Many Chachamim rejected that proof!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The case is, the basket was hanging on her (it is not in his Reshus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> Even if the basket was tied to her but dragging on the ground (she is divorced).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #3 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The case is, the basket was between her legs. (He allows her to use the place between her legs, so it is like her Reshus.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #4 (Rav Mesharshiya brei d'Rav. Ami):</span> The case is, he sells baskets (therefore, he allows her to use place of the basket).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #5 (R. Yochanan):</span> A man allows his wife to use the place of her garment and basket.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman - Beraisa):</span> In the seller's premises, he does not acquire until he does Hagbahah or takes it out of the premises.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is even if the Kli belongs to the buyer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is only when the seller owns it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If that case refers to the seller's Kli, also the next case does!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> In the buyer's premises, he acquires as soon as the seller agrees to sell.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Why should he acquire in the seller's Kli?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to the buyer's Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Beraisa assume in the Reisha that they use the seller's Kli, and in the Seifa, they use the buyer's Kli?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The seller's Kelim are more common in the seller's premises. The buyer's Kelim are more common in the buyer's premises.</p>
