<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>FOLLOWING THE ROV IN MONETARY MATTERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven bought Shimon's Peros and planted them, and they did not grow, even if he bought flax seeds, Shimon is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if he bought seeds that are not (normally) eaten, Shimon is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> If Reuven sold an ox to Shimon, and it was found to be a gorer, it is a Mekach Ta'os (a mistaken sale; it is void).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Reuven can say 'I sold it to you for slaughter' (the sale is valid).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let us see whether Shimon buys oxen for plowing or for slaughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he buys for both.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let us see whether he paid the price of a plowing ox or an ox for slaughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the price is the same for both.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what difference does it make whether or not the sale is valid?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it is valid, Shimon must toil to sell it. If it is invalid, he can demand that Reuven refund the money.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">92b----------------------------------------92b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Reuven has no money to repay Shimon what he owes, he may give to him the ox!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Reuven has other money;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav says the sale is invalid. We follow the Rov (majority), and most people buy oxen for plowing;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2..</span><p>Shmuel says, he can say 'I sold it to you for slaughter.' We follow the Rov for Isurim, but not in monetary matters.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Mishnah):</span> If Leah was widowed or divorced, and she claims that she was a virgin when she married Reuven (so her Kesuvah is 200 Zuz), and he (or his heirs) claim that she was not (so her Kesuvah is 100):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If witnesses testify that (at the wedding) she had a Hinuma (a canopy of myrtle, or a veil over her eyes), or her hair was uncovered (the custom of virgin brides) she collects 200.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If she does not have witnesses, she only gets 100.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> We should follow the Rov! Most women are virgins when they marry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Most women are virgins when married, but a minority are not. Every virgin who marries has a Kol (people remember it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since Leah has no Kol, this weakens the Rov (so we do not follow it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If every virgin has a Kol, and Leah has no Kol, we should not believe witnesses. Surely they are lying!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, most virgins who marry have a Kol. Since Leah has no Kol, this weakens the Rov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Levi sold a slave to Yehudah, and the slave was found to be a thief or Kuvyustus (Tosfos - diceplayer; Rashi - kidnapper), the sale stands;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he was found to be an armed robber or sentenced (by the kingdom) to die, the sale is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> In the Reisha, the sale stands because most slaves are thieves or Kuvyustus. (This shows that we follow the Rov with regard to monetary matters).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="note"><span>Note:</span> If a buyer asked Stam for an item, all agree that the seller may give to him from the majority! Here is not like Stam. Even if the buyer does not specify, all know that he does not want a thief. However, if we follow the majority, and he asks Stam, he accepts that the seller may give to him from the majority.</span></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, <i>all</i> slaves are [thieves or Kuvyustus]..</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="note"><span>Note:</span> We need not say that literally every slave is so. Rather, it is such a strong majority that a righteous slave is not called a Stam slave, so all agree that the buyer has no claim to say that he wanted a righteous slave.</span></p></div>
