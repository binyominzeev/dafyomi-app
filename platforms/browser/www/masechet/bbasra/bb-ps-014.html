<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> He leaves enough (blank parchment) at each end to roll.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he roll it around?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He rolls around a pole.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One end requires enough to surround the Sefer!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He wraps around the outermost parchment.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One end requires only enough to wrap around the pole!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to the contradiction and Question 1 - Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> He leaves what is needed at each end. (At one end, he needs enough to roll around a pole. At the other end, he needs enough to surround the Sefer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> This Beraisa refers to a Sefer Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Other Seforim are wound (on one pole) from the beginning to the end. We leave a Sefer Torah (open) in the middle, and wrap from poles at both ends.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer bar Tzadok says, this is how scribes in Yerushalayim used to write Seforim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE PROPER SIZE OF A SEFER TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The height of a Sefer Torah should (l'Chatchilah) equal its circumference when rolled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How big should it be?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> If one writes on Gevil (untanned hide), it should be six Tefachim. If one uses Klaf, (when the hide is cut into two layers, the layer closer to the hair is called Klaf. It is thinner than Gevil), I do not know.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Huna wrote 70 Sifrei Torah. For one of them the height equaled its circumference.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Acha bar Yakov wrote one Sefer Torah on a calf's hide. The height equaled the circumference.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabanan were envious, and Rav Acha died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> R. Ami wrote 400 Sifrei Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Hamnuna:</span> Perhaps he wrote "Torah Tzivah Lanu Moshe."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> R. Ami planted 400 vineyards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Hamnuna:</span> Perhaps each was (a minimal vineyard,) two rows of two trees, and a fifth tree in back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The Aron that Moshe made was two and a half Amos in length, its width and height were both one and a half Amos, based on an Amah of six Tefachim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The length and width of each of the Luchos (Tablets) was six Tefachim. Each was three Tefachim thick. They were placed next to the Sefer Torah (in the Aron).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Together, they occupied 12 Tefachim. Of the remaining three Tefachim of the Aron's length, the (thickness of the) walls of the Aron occupied one Tefach (half a Tefach each),</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The (width of the) Sefer Torah fit in the remaining two Tefachim - "Ein ba'Aron Rak..."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>'Ein' and 'Rak' are two exclusions. Two exclusions come to include;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We include the Sefer Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The width of the Luchos occupied 6 Tefachim. The walls of the Aron occupied one Tefach;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Another two Tefachim remained, in order that the Torah (whose length was to the Aron's width) could be removed and put back easily.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Yehudah says, the dimensions of the Aron are based on an Amah of five Tefachim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Luchos occupied 12 Tefachim of the Aron's length, the walls of the Aron occupied the remaining half Tefach (each wall was a quarter Tefach);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The width of the Luchos occupied 6 Tefachim, and the walls of the Aron occupied half a Tefach; in the remaining Tefach were silver poles - "Amudav Asah Chesef";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The chest that the Plishtim sent when they returned the Aron was next to the Aron - "va'Argaz mi'Tzido".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Sefer Torah rested on the chest, next to the Aron, not inside - "v'Samtem Oso mi'Tzad Aron..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The exclusions 'Ein' and 'Rak' come to include the fragments of the broken Luchos.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If the circumference of the Sefer Torah is six Tefachim, the width is (a third of the circumference,) two Tefachim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since we roll a Sefer Torah from both ends, the width is even more (when it is in the middle. Rashash - this is because the area of one circle of diameter 2 equals the combined area two circles of diameter (the square root of 2, which is about) 17/12). The combined diameters is 34/12, which is almost 3.) How can it fit in two Tefachim (according to R. Meir)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Sefer Torah in the Aron was rolled to (Rashi - from) the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, if its width is exactly two Tefachim, it does not fit properly in two Tefachim! (Chasam Sofer - really, the width is less than a third of the circumference (the ratio is 1/Pi, about 7/22). The pole on which it is wound completed the (last 1/11 of a Tefach) two Tefachim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> A small amount of parchment was left unrolled (so the width of the rolled part was less than two), it rested above the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHERE THE TORAH AND LUCHOS WERE KEPT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yehudah, where was the Sefer Torah before the Plishtim gave the chest?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It rested on a plank protruding from the Aron.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Meir learn from "v'Samtem Oso mi'Tzad Aron..."?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that the Torah is between the Luchos and the wall of the Aron, not between the two Luchos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Meir, where were the silver poles?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were outside the Aron.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's source that the broken Luchos were in the Aron?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He learns like Rav Huna;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> "Shem Shem" teaches that the Luchos and the broken Luchos were in the Aron.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Yehudah learns R. Yochanan's law from this verse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This teaches that Hash-m's (primary) name and the other names that refer to Him were in the Aron.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Meir must also learn this from the verse!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He learns like Rav Yosef.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "Asher Shibarta v'Samtam ba'Aron" teaches that the Luchos and the broken Luchos were in the Aron.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Yehudah expounds this like Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1..</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Asher Shibarta" - Hash-m praised Moshe for breaking the Luchos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE ORDER OF THE NEVI'IM AND KESUVIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The order of the Nevi'im is Yehoshua, Shoftim, Shmuel, Melachim, Yirmeyahu, Yechezkeil, Yeshayah, and the 12 (small prophecies).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Hoshe'a (who is among the 12) prophesized before Yeshayah. His Sefer should precede Yeshayah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "Techilas Diber Hash-m b'Hoshe'a"? There were many Nevi'im between Moshe and Hoshe'a!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He was the first of four Nevi'im who prophesized in his time: Hoshe'a, Yeshayah, Amos and Michah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Hoshe'a is among the 12, which includes Chagai, Zecharyah and Malachi (the last Nevi'im), it follows Yeshayah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It should be written by itself before Yeshayah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since it is small, it might get lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yeshayah preceded Yirmeyahu and Yechezkeil. His Sefer should precede theirs!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The end of Melachim discusses the Churban, and all of (Sefer) Yirmeyahu discusses Churban. Yechezkeil begins with Churban and ends with consolation, and all of Yeshayah discusses consolation;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>These Nevi'im are ordered so that the beginning of each Sefer is like the end of the previous one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The order of the Kesuvim is Rus, Tehilim, Iyov, Mishlei, Koheles, Shir ha'Shirim, Eichah, Daniel, Megilas Esther, Ezra and Divrei ha'Yamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that Iyov lived in Moshe's time, Iyov should be first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not begin with punishments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We begin with Rus, which discusses punishments!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Its punishments have a good end.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> She is called Rus, because her descendant (David) satiated (Rivahu) Hash-m with songs and praises.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHO WROTE THE SEFORIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who wrote Torah, the Nevi'im and Kesuvim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moshe wrote the Torah, including the Parshah of Bilam, and Sefer Iyov;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Yehoshua wrote Sefer Yehoshua and the last eight verses of the Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Shmuel wrote Sefer Shmuel, Shoftim and Rus;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>David and ten other Chachamim composed Tehilim - Adam, Malki Tzedek (Shem), Avraham, Moshe, Heiman, Yedusun, Asaf, and Korach's three sons.</p>
