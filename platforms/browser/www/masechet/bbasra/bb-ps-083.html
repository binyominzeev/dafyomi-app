<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SPACING OF THE TREES (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> I base my ruling (which is like R. Shimon, as we shall see) on the following case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashbam):</span> A case came in front of Rav Yehudah, and he ruled that the buyer receives the land in between, even though they were separated only by the amount needed for an ox and its Kelim (four Amos, like we will explain).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> A case came in front of Rav Yehudah, and he ruled that the buyer receives the land in between, because for each pair of trees, the separation was no more than the amount needed for an ox and its Kelim for each tree (i.e. eight Amos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I did not know what is the amount needed for an ox and its Kelim until I heard the Beraisa explaining the following Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not plant a tree near another's field, unless there are four Amos in between.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Four Amos is the area needed to tend to a vineyard.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>This teaches that the amount needed for an ox and its Kelim is four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yosef also holds like an opinion in that Mishnah! (Why did Abaye say that the Mishnah supports Rav Nachman?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa of that Mishnah - R. Meir and R. Shimon):</span> If rows of a vineyard are eight Amos apart, one may seed other things in between.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case R. Yehudah brought in the Mishnah supports the first Tana. Presumably, the Halachah follows him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We understand Rav Yosef's source (to say between four and eight), according to R. Shimon:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says in the Mishnah, eight Amos (or more) is considered too far apart;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn what is too close from the following Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If rows of a vineyard are less than four Amos apart (people do not plant vineyards like this), it is not considered a vineyard;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim say, we ignore those vines that are too close together, and (if enough trees remain) it is considered a vineyard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, we understand Rav Nachman's source to say that more than 16 is too sparse, according to Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is his source that less than eight is too dense?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, just like the amount that R. Shimon considers too sparse is twice the amount that is too dense, also according to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava himself):</span> The Halachah is, between four and 16 Amos (is the proper spacing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one bought trees spaced between four and 16 Amos apart, he acquires land and the trees in between;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, if a tree dried up or was cut, he may plant another.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they were less than four or more than 16 Amos apart, or if he bought them one at a time, he does not acquire land nor the trees in between;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Therefore, if a tree dried up or was cut, he may not plant another.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> Do we measure the spacing between the thick part of the trunks or the thin part?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashbam - Answer (Rav Gavihah - Mishnah):</span> If one grafts a young vine onto a mature vine, we measure (four Amos, to determine if this joins with other vines to make a vineyard) from the second joint (i.e. from the place of medium thickness).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Answer (Rav Gavihah - Mishnah):</span> If one bends a vine back into the ground, we measure (four Amos) from the base of the second place it leaves the ground (i.e. where it is thick).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN DOES THE BUYER ACQUIRE LAND?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> If Reuven bought a tree with shoots that were covered with dirt, and they are more than four Amos apart (so it looks like three trees), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Gavihah - Mishnah - R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok):</span> If one bends three vines back into the ground, and they grew out again, they (join and) are considered a vineyard only if and they are spaced between four and eight Amos apart. (Also regarding trees, it is like buying three trees, and he acquires land.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Papa):</span> If Shimon sold two trees in his field and one on the border, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Question #2 (Rashbam - If he acquires land in the above case,) if he sold two trees in his field and one (which he owned) in another's field, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>These questions are not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">83b----------------------------------------83b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> (Rashbam - If in those cases he acquires,) do the following interrupt between the trees (and therefore, he did not acquire land): a pit; an irrigation ditch; a Reshus ha'Rabim; or a row of date trees?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>These questions are not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Hillel):</span> If a cedar tree grew (afterwards) between the trees, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! Since there was no separation when Reuven bought them, he acquired land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if a cedar tree was between the trees (at the time of the sale), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> He acquires land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How must the trees be positioned in order that the buyer acquires land?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> They are in a line.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> They form a triangle.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav would say that all the more so he acquires land if they form a triangle;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel would say that he does not acquire land if they are in a line.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The seller wants the area in between, because it can be sown.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Hamnuna):</span> If he acquires when they are in a triangle, because the seller cannot sow the area in between, he should also acquire when he buys three prickly shrubs, because the area in between will not be sown!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Trees are important, so the land between them is included. Shrubs are not important.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT IS INCLUDED WITH AN ANIMAL THAT IS SOLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sells the head of a large animal, the legs are not included;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he sells the legs, the head is not included.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he sells the Kaneh (lung), the liver is not included. If he sells the liver, the Kaneh is not included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Regarding a small animal, if he sells the head, the legs are included;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he sells the legs, the head is not included.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he sells the Kaneh, the liver is included. If he sells the liver, the Kaneh is not included.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHO CAN RETRACT FROM A MISTAKEN SALE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>There are four laws of (retraction from) a sale. If Reuven sold (what was understood to be) good wheat, and it was found to be bad, the buyer (Shimon) can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he sold bad wheat, and it was found to be good, Reuven can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was found to be like it was understood to be, neither can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In the following cases, either can retract. He sold red wheat, and it was found to be white, or vice-versa. He sold olive wood, and it was found to be sycamore, or vice-versa. He sold wine, and it was found to be vinegar, or vice-versa.</p>
