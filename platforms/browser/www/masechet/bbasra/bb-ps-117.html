<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO RECEIVED PORTIONS OF ERETZ YISRAEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Our Mishnah is like the opinion that portions of Eretz Yisrael were allocated to those who left Mitzrayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah):</span> "Li'Shmos Matos Avosam Yinchalu" teaches that portions of Eretz Yisrael were allocated to those who left Mitzrayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, how do we understand "la'Eleh (to the men counted before we entered Eretz Yisrael) Techalek ha'Aretz b'Nachalah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "La'Eleh" - those that get portions must be like these (those counted, i.e. at least 20 years old). This excludes children (but those who left Mitzrayim get the portions).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yonason says, portions of Eretz Yisrael were allocated to those who entered - "la'Eleh Techalek ha'Aretz b'Nachalah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, how do we understand "li'Shmos Matos Avosam Yinchalu"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This inheritance is unique. In all other inheritances, the living inherit the dead. Here, the dead inherit the living.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> A parable for this is two Kohanim brothers who lived in one city. One has one son, and the other has two. At the granary, the father of one takes one portion, and the father of two takes two portions. The fathers give (all three of) their portions to their father, and split them equally.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon Ben Elazar):</span> The land was allocated to those who left Mitzrayim and those who entered Eretz Yisrael, to fulfill both verses.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">117b----------------------------------------117b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A man who left Mitzrayim received a portion with those that left Mitzrayim. One who entered Eretz Yisrael received a portion for entering. One who left Mitzrayim and entered Eretz Yisrael received two portions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Yehoshua and Kalev received the portions of the other Meraglim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The complainers and Korach's congregation did not receive portions;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Their children inherited in the merit of their own grandfathers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that "li'Shmos Matos Avosam Yinchalu" refers to those who left Mitzrayim? Perhaps it refers to the 12 tribes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Nosati Osah Lachem Morashah" was said to those who left Mitzrayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> According to the opinion that shares were allocated to those who left Mitzrayim, we understand "la'Rav Tarbeh Nachalaso vela'Me'at Tam'it Nachalaso" (the inheritance depends on how many left Mitzrayim. It does not depend on the family size when it entered Eretz Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> According to the opinion that shares were allocated to those who entered, what does this verse teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
