<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DEPOSITS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN STOLEN (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> If he took a deposit from a child, he sells it and buys a Segulah (something that yields fruits and the principal remains intact, like we will explain);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the child dies, he gives the Segulah to the child's heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the woman, slave or child said just before dying 'it belongs to Ploni', we give it to Ploni;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven does not believe this, he gives it to the husband, owner or father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>When the wife of Rabah bar bar Chanah died, she said 'these rings belong to Marsa and his grandsons.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rav (to Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> If you believe her, do like she said. If not, keep them for yourself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav:</span> If you think that Marsa and his grandsons are wealthy enough to deposit such rings with your wife (alternatively, if you think that your wife had friends who would give her such rings for a gift (on condition that you have no rights to them), do like she said. If not, keep them for yourself. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one took a deposit from a child, he sells it and buys a Segulah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Segulah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is a Sefer Torah. (One may sell it only to get married.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> It is a date tree from which he eats dates.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHAZAKAH IN PROPERTY OF RELATIVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A father does not get a Chazakah in his son's property, nor vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> This applies even if the son is independent of his father (for one would not protest if the other used his property).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If the son is independent of his father, they can get a Chazakah against each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah mi'Difti):</span> A case occurred, and Rav Papi ruled like Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> I heard that Rav Nachman held like Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Halachah follows Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a son was independent of his father, or a woman was divorced, he or she can get a Chazakah in the property of his or her father or ex-husband, like a stranger.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A BROTHER WHO RAN THE ESTATE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Yakov died, and Reuven (one of the orphans) used to buy and sell property of the estate on behalf of all the brothers. There were documents saying that he bought property or lent money. He claims that they belong to him himself, from money he inherited from his mother's father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> He must bring proof. (If not, we assume that the property or loans belong to all the brothers.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> His brothers must bring proof (if not, he is believed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Rav admits that after Reuven dies, his brothers must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Do we claim on behalf of Reuven's orphans something that he himself could not claim (that the brothers must bring proof)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rava took combers' scissors and a Sefer of Agadata from orphans (of Ploni), for these are things that are normally lent or rented;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Avin):</span> If something is normally lent or rented (and it is known that it previously belonged to someone else), one is not believed to say that he bought it. (Since Ploni would not have been believed to say 'I bought it', we do not make this claim on behalf of his orphans.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Rav's law applies only when the brothers share everything, but if they prepare their food separately, we assume that Reuven acquired money by eating less.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of proof must Reuven bring?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> He must bring witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> The document must be validated (this shows that Beis Din verified that it is Reuven's property).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rava (to Rav Nachman):</span> Like whom do you hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> I hold like the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven used to buy and sell on behalf of all the brothers, and documents said that he bought property or lent money; and he claims that they belong to him himself, from money he inherited from his mother's father, he must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, if a widow used to buy and sell on behalf of the orphans, and documents said that she bought property or lent money; and she claims that they belong to her, from money she inherited from her grandfather, she must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush regarding the widow?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since a widow who toils on behalf of orphans is respected, she is unlikely to falsely claim their money, and she should be believed. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so. (She feels she is entitled to compensation for her toil, and rationalizes claiming their property for herself.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CHAZAKAH TO ACQUIRE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This refers to Chazakah, but if one gives a gift, or brothers that divide an inheritance ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are the latter cases not Chazakah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows: three years are needed for Chazakah that is a proof of ownership (for one who lost his document), but regarding a gift, division of inheritance, or Kinyan of Hefker property, when only a Kinyan is needed (not a proof), locking the fence, fencing or breaching any amount in a wall is a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Hoshaya):</span> Locking the fence, fencing or breaching any amount in a wall in front of the original owner is a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that if it is not in front of the owner, it is not a Chazakah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He means, if it is in front of the owner, the owner need not say 'go make a Chazakah and acquire.' If it is not in front of the owner, the owner must say 'go make a Chazakah and acquire'.</p>
