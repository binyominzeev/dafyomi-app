<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DIVISIONS IN A FIELD (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> It is (called a different Reshus ha'Rabim) only if a Reshus ha'Yachid separates one from the other, but not if a Karmelis separates them (for one is not liable for transferring between a Reshus ha'Rabim and a Karmelis. Mid'Oraisa, Karmelis is neither Reshus ha'Yachid or Reshus ha'Rabim. Mid'Rabanan, it has the stringencies of both.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> It is even if a Karmelis separates them, but not if a piece of wood separates them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is even if a piece of wood separates them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This is like Rava said elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Domains of Shabbos have the same law as domains regarding Gitin. (If a man lent his Chatzer to his wife to receive her Get (he will throw it there), a piece of wood is considered a domain unto itself. He lent to her only the Chatzer, but not the wood. If the Get lands there, she is not divorced.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there is no fence or Chatzav, what is the law (Rashbam - of one who makes Chazakah in property of a convert that died; Tosfos - regarding Tum'ah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Merinus):</span> Whatever was called one field is considered one field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'it was called one field'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It was called 'the Gargusa (irrigated field) of Ploni.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Avya):</span> What is Chatzuva?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is a tree that Yehoshua used to mark borders. (Its roots go straight down, so it does not nurture from the other's property).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OTHER TEACHINGS OF RAV YEHUDAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Yehoshua listed only the cities on the borders (to teach what is within each tribe).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One must tithe Peros of all the land that Hash-m showed Moshe (before Moshe died).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes the lands of the Keni, Kenizi and Kadmoni (even when they will become part of Eretz Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> These lands (of the Keni, Kenizi and Kadmoni) are Naftucha, Arva'ah and Shalma'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, they are Mount Se'ir, Amon and Mo'av;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon says, they are Ardiskim, Asya and Aspamya.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>COMBINING TESTIMONIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two witnesses testified that Reuven ate the Peros of Shimon's field for three years, and they were Huzmu (they were found to be Zomemim, i.e. they were not present where they claimed to see the testimony), they pay Shimon the entire value of the field;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a different pair of witnesses testified about each of the three years, and all were Huzmu, they jointly pay Shimon the entire value.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If David testified about all three years, and three brothers testified, each about one of the three years, (this is testimony of Chazakah, for) testimony of each year is separate (the brothers do not testify together);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Hazamah, it is like one testimony (they are exempt unless all of them are Huzmu).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Our Mishnah is not like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Chalifta) Question:</span> If a different pair of witnesses testified about each of the three years of Chazakah, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> This is a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Aba Chalifta:</span> I agree, but R. Akiva argues.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> "(According to two witnesses will be established a) Davar (matter)", and not half a Davar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim disqualify due to 'half a Davar'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One witness saw one hair on the back of a 12 year-old girl, and another witness saw one hair on her front.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is not 'half a Davar.' It is half testimony! (Each witness says that she only has one hair, so she is still a minor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, two witnesses saw one hair on her back, and two other witnesses saw one hair on her front. (Rashbam - neither pair saw all that was possible to see at the time; Tosfos - the testimony of either pair by itself has no significance at all.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one witness saw Reuven eat wheat, and one saw him eat barley, this is a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> If so, we should also say that if one witness saw Reuven eat in the first, third and fifth years (of a six year period), and another witness saw him eat the other three years, this is a Chazakah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Yehudah):</span> There is different, for they do not testify about the same years. I discuss witnesses who testify about the same years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They argue about what he ate!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he makes a Chazakah through eating either, witnesses are not careful to see exactly what he eats.</p>
