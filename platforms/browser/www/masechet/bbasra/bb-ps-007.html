<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA BASRA 2-8 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to Rav Weiner -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE NEED NOT SUFFER TO HELP ANOTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Reuven lived in the upper story of a house, and Shimon lived on bottom. The walls sank. Shimon suggested that they rebuild the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> I have no problem!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> I will destroy it and rebuild it myself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> No. I would have no place to live in the meantime!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> I will rent a place for you.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> I don't want the bother of moving. If you bend down, you can use your house!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chama):</span> Reuven's claim is accepted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if the roof is at least 10 Tefachim above the ground. If not, Reuven is occupying Shimon's domain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is only if they did not stipulate from the beginning (that if the wall falls, they must rebuild it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they had stipulated, how high do they rebuild it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Nachman citing Rav Nachman):</span> A Mishnah (about one who was contracted to build a house) teaches that it must be half the combined length and width of the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava citing Rav Nachman):</span> It must be like people normally live.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is that?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is so that Shimon can enter with a load of long reeds and turn around.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Levi was building a wall in back of Yehudah's window. Yehudah complained that this blocks his light.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> I will seal your window and make a window for you above my wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> No. That would weaken my wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> I will destroy the top of your wall (until the window), and rebuild it with a window above my wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> No. A wall that is half-new and half-old is not sturdy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> I will destroy the entire wall, and rebuild it with a window above my wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> No. A house with a new wall and old walls is not sturdy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> I will destroy your house, and rebuild it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> No. I would have no place to live in the meantime!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> I will rent a place for you.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> I don't want the bother of moving!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chama):</span> Yehudah's claim is accepted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is just like the previous case! (Why did we need to teach both?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even if Yehudah uses his house only for storing straw and wood, his claim is accepted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Reuven and Shimon divided property; Reuven took a nice hall (that is open on one side). Shimon took the garden next to it, and he started building a wall in between.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> This will block my light!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> I build on my own property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chama):</span> Shimon's claim is accepted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>RIGHTS OF BROTHERS WHO DIVIDE AN INHERITANCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Why is this different than the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Levi and Yehudah divided an inheritance, and Levi took a vineyard, and Yehudah took a grain field, Levi may enter four Amos into Yehudah's field (to tend to his vines). This is an understood condition of the division.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> That is when Levi compensated Yehudah for the amount that a vineyard is worth more than a grain field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that Shimon did not get compensated. Is he a fool, to give up a hall and take a garden without compensation?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was compensated for the extra bricks and beams that Reuven took. There was no compensation for rights to air and light.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't Reuven say 'I compensated you on condition to receive a nice hall, not a dark room!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Simi bar Aba):</span> It is still called a hall, even if it is unlike standard halls.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Levi said to Yehudah 'I sell to you a Beis Kor (the area of land in which a Kor of seed is planted) of dirt (i.e. the entire area is farmable)', if people call it a Beis Kor, the sale stands, even if the area is only half of that;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is because he sold a field called a Beis Kor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'I sell to you a vineyard (or an orchard)', if people call it that, the sale stands, even if has no vines (or trees) (like above);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is different!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There, the seller can say 'I sold to you something called a Beis Kor (or vineyard...)' Here, Reuven can say 'I took the hall on condition to live in it like our fathers did!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Mar Yanuka and Mar Kashisha, sons of Rav Chisda:</span> Rav Chama holds like Shmuel, who was also from Neharde'a;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> If brothers split an inheritance, neither has any of the following rights: windows (to prevent the other from blocking light to them), to fix a ladder in the Chatzer (to get to an upper story), or to dig a trench through the other's field so that water will flow from the irrigation ditch.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Brothers have such rights.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Orphans had a loan document (of their father). A receipt said that it was paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chama:</span> We do not let the orphans collect, nor do we tear their document.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They do not collect, for perhaps it really was paid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We do not tear their document. Perhaps when they grow up, they will show that the receipt is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Whom does the Halachah follow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> The Halachah follows Rav Chama in all the above laws, except for the case of the receipt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not suspect that witnesses would sign a false receipt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Mari):</span> Also here the Halachah follows Rav Chama. If it was a good receipt, it should have been seen in the father's lifetime!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since it was not seen before, we suspect that it was forged.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OBLIGATIONS OF MEMBERS OF A CHATZER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Members of a Chatzer can force each other to build a Beis Sha'ar (a place for a watchman to stay, and to stop people from looking into the Chatzer) and a door for the Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, some Chatzeros are not fitting for a Beis Sha'ar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>People of a city can force each other to build a wall with a door and bolt (to lock it);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, some cities are not fitting for a wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One who has lived in the city 12 months is considered a resident (and must contribute to city projects);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he bought a dwelling, he is considered a resident immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Mishnah implies that a Beis Sha'ar is a good thing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, Eliyahu used to speak with a certain Chasid regularly, until the Chasid built a Beis Sha'ar (it muffles the cry of poor people asking for Tzedakah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If it is in the Chatzer, it is bad. If it is outside (and has no door), it is good, (for it gives privacy, and the poor can enter and be heard).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> A Beis Sha'ar outside the Chatzer is bad if it has a door. It is good if it has no door.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> A Beis Sha'ar with a door outside the Chatzer is bad if the key is not there. It is good if the key is left there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> A Beis Sha'ar with a door and key (outside the Chatzer) is bad if it can be opened only from the inside. It is good if a poor person can open it from the outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Members of a Chatzer can force each other to build a Beis Sha'ar and a door for the Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> A Chatzer is fitting for a Beis Sha'ar only if it is near the Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim argue, because even if it is not close, sometimes the Reshus ha'Rabim is crowded, and people enter the Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OBLIGATIONS OF RESIDENTS OF A CITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> People of a city can force each other...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> A city is fitting for a wall only if it is close to the border (of Eretz Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim argue, for even if it is not close, sometimes troops pass by.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (R. Elazar):</span> When they collect, does every person pay the same amount, or do people pay according to their wealth?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> They pay according to their wealth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (R. Elazar):</span> When they collect, does one pay according to how close he is to the wall (one who is closer is in bigger danger; he needs it more), or do people pay according to their wealth?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> One pays according to how close he is to the wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yehudah Nesi'ah collected for needs of a wall. He said that Chachamim must also pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Chachamim do not need to be guarded (so they need not pay)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Esperem me'Chol Yirbun" - who is more numerous than the sand?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be Tzadikim, for all of Yisrael is likened to the sand!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the deeds of Tzadikim are more numerous than the sand.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A small amount of sand is like a protecting wall surrounding the sea. All the more so, the deeds of Tzadikim protect them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is not the source! Rather, "Ani Chomah" refers to Torah; "v'Shodai ka'Migdalos" refers to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reish Lakish did not learn from here, for he expounds like Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Ani Chomah" refers to the congregation of Yisrael. "V'Shodai ka'Migdalos" refers to synagogues and Batei Medrash.</p>
