<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SON IS THE CLOSEST RELATIVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even without this answer, a son is in place of his father for two laws, and a brother is in place of his brother for only one law!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also for Sedei Achuzah, the Torah said only that the closest relative stands in place to redeem it. It did not specify who is closest;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a brother would be considered closer regarding Yibum, we would have one source to say that a brother is closer, and one source (Yi'ud) to say that the son is closer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, since we say that even regarding Yibum, a son is closer, he is closer also for Sedei Achuzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> We should rather expound "She'ero" to teach that Reuven's father takes precedence over Reuven's daughter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that the father comes even before the son. "Ha'Karov" teaches that the closest relative inherits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since a son and daughter are equivalent regarding Yibum, also regarding inheritance (they both precede the father).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> We should rather expound "She'ero" to teach that the father takes precedence over the father's brothers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that the father comes even before the brother. "Ha'Karov" teaches that the closest relative inherits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We know that the father comes before the uncles without a verse. Uncles only inherit because they are relatives of the father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Beraisa learns unlike the verse!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Im Ein Lo Achim (you will give the inheritance to She'ero.)" (The Beraisa learns that She'ero (the father) comes before the deceased's brothers!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verses are written out of order. (They discuss uncles before the father, even though surely the father has precedence, like we said. Rather, the closest relative always comes first.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>AN ALTERNATE WAY OF LEARNING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 3:b 108b) - Beraisa - R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> (We learn that a father inherits from) "if a man will die without a son (v'Ha'avartem Es Nachalaso l'Vito)" - we transfer inheritance from the father to a daughter, but not from the father to a brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this teaches that we transfer inheritance from Reuven's brothers to his daughter, but not from Reuven's father to Reuven's daughter?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">109b----------------------------------------109b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Torah should not have said "v'Ha'avartem". (Rashbam, according to Bach - in the suggestion, v'Ha'avartem was <i>not</i> the source that we do not transfer from the father to the daughter, therefore it should have said 'u'Nsatem', like the other verses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The Tana of the previous Beraisa (108b) learns inheritance of the father from "She'ero.") R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi learns from "v'Ha'avartem." What does he learn from "She'ero"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "<i>She'ero</i>" refers to his wife. It teaches that a man inherits his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the previous Tana learn from "v'Ha'avartem"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Regarding all other inheritances it says "u'Nsatem". Regarding a daughter, it says "v'Ha'avartem", because only a daughter is Ma'avir (transfers) inheritance from one tribe to another.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A woman (usually) is inherited by her husband or son. If her husband is from a different tribe, the inheritance passes to his tribe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi know that "She'ero" means 'his wife'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "(your father's wife) She'er Avicha Hi".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it means 'his mother' - "She'er Imecha Hi"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> "Mi'Mishpacht<i>o</i> v'Yarash Osah" - the father's family is called family, but the mother's family is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We learn from "l'Mishpechosam l'Veis Avosam."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also the mother's family is called family! It says "there was a youth mi'Beis Lechem Yehudah mi'Mishpachas Yehudah v'Hu Levi".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can he be a Levi, and from the family of Yehudah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that his father was a Levi, and his mother was from Yehudah, and it says "mi'Mishpachas Yehudah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar Rav Chanan):</span> No. His name was Levi. He was not a Levi; he was from Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did Michah say "Hayah Li ha'Levi l'Chohen"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was happy that he found a man whose name was Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> His name was not Levi. It was Yonason - "vi'Yhonason ben Gershom ben Menasheh..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> The Torah says explicitly that Gershom's father was not Menasheh, it was Moshe!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that since Yonason acted like Menasheh (ben Chizkiyah, who served idolatry), the verse ascribes him to Menasheh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, he was a Levi. He is ascribed to Yehudah because he acted like Menasheh, who came from Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This shows that we ascribe a corruption to another corruption.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> We learn this principle from "...v'Oso (Adoniyahu) Yoldah Acharei Avshalom".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Adoniyahu's mother was Chagis, and Avshalom's mother was Ma'achah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Adoniyahu acted like Avshalom (tried to make himself king), he is ascribed to (the same mother as) Avshalom.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE IMPORTANCE OF LINEAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One should marry into a family of good lineage. Moshe married Yisro's daughter, and Yonason descended from him. Aharon married Aminadov's daughter, and Pinchas descended from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also Pinchas descends from Yisro - "Elazar... mi'Benos Puti'el Lo l'Ishah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Puti'el is Yisro. He is called Puti'el, for he fattened (Pitem) calves for idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, Puti'el is Yosef, who fought (Pitpet) against his inclination.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The tribes scorned Pinchas '...this son of Puti, the son of he who fattened calves for idolatry...'!</p>
