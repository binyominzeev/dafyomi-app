<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>R. ABA'S LAW OF THE INGOT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>One witness testified in front of R. Ami that Reuven grabbed an ingot from Shimon. Reuven said 'yes, I grabbed it. It is mine!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Ami):</span> What is the law? We cannot obligate Reuven based on one witness, nor can we totally exempt him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashbam):</span> We cannot require him to swear (to contradict the witness, and say that he did not take it), for he admits that he took it!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In this sense he is like a thief, who cannot swear. (However, a thief cannot swear because he is not believed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashba):</span> We cannot require him to swear that he took his own ingot. Shimon was Muchzak in what he was holding. It is as if Reuven admits that he stole it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> He is obligated to swear, but he cannot, therefore he must pay.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WITNESS FOR CHAZAKAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (of Rabanan, Sof 33b - Abaye):</span> Our case (one witness said that David ate the years of Chazakah) is unlike that of R. Aba!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In R. Aba's case, the witness comes to obligate Reuven. If a second witnesses were with him, all the more so Reuven would have to return it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here, the witness comes to support David. If a second witness were with him, David would keep the land and Peros! (Therefore, David does not pay for the Peros.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Rather, if one witness testified that David ate the fruit for two years, we would learn from R. Aba's law. (Since David cannot swear that he did not eat, he would pay for the Peros for those years.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DOES BEIS DIN SEIZE CONTESTED PROPERTY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reuven and Shimon each claimed to own the same ship. Reuven came to Beis Din and said 'seize the ship until I bring witnesses.' Do we seize it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> We seize it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> We do not seize it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reuven did not find witnesses. He asked Beis Din to release the ship, and Kol d'Alim Gavar (whoever overpowers the other (with proofs or physically) gets it). Do we release it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> We do not release it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> We release it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Halachah is, we do not seize it. If we seized it, we do not release it.</p>
