<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A SALE WITHIN DEFINED BORDERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I sell to you the Beis Kor within the following borders', if it is less than a sixth (less than a Beis Kor), the sale stands. If it is up to a sixth, he deducts (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> If it is a sixth less, it is as if it is lacking less than a sixth, and he does not deduct from the price;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If it is a sixth less, it is as if it is lacking more than a sixth, and he deducts from the price.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Huna explains the Mishnah as follows. If it is less than (or exactly) a sixth (less than a Beis Kor), the sale stands. If it is more than a sixth, he deducts from the price;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Yehudah explains the Mishnah as follows. If it is less than a sixth, the sale stands; (exactly or) more than a sixth, he deducts from the price.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> (If one said 'I sell to you the Beis Kor) within the following borders', if it is a sixth less or more (than a Beis Kor), the law is like when judges estimated land of orphans (and erred); the sale stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding estimation of judges, a mistake of a sixth is like more than a sixth!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Huna):</span> It says that the sale stands!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> We must explain as follows. It is like the estimation of judges regarding a sixth, the sale stands (according to R. Shimon ben Gamliel; the Beraisa is like him). (We follow the Rashbam's text; see the Bach.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is difficult for Rav Yehudah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is like the estimation of judges (in one aspect), and it is not like the estimation of judges (in another aspect):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is like the estimation of judges regarding a sixth; the mistake is not pardoned (the Beraisa is Chachamim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is unlike the estimation of judges, for there, the sale is void. Here, the sale stands, but he deducts from the price.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Ploni sold land to Rav Papa. He said 'it measures 20 Grivi.' In truth, it was 15.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">106b----------------------------------------106b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> You realized that it was 15, and you bought it anyway.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If it is a sixth less, the sale stands. If it is up to a sixth, he deducts from the price.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when the buyer did not know. Here, Rav Papa knew that it was 15.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> He told me 20!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> He can say 'I meant that it is as good as a field of 20.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DIVISION OF BROTHERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> When brothers divide an estate, once one picks his share by lottery, everyone acquires his share. (Ra'avad - if two or more brothers remain, they must divide the rest by lottery; Rashbam - they can divide the rest as they wish; Ran - if they agreed that the portions would go in order (e.g. according to their births), all the shares are acquired when the first brother picks his share).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> It is like the initial division of Eretz Yisrael. Just like that was by lottery, also regarding brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it must be like the initial division of Eretz Yisrael, we should require not only a box (for the lots), but also (Re'em; alternatively - we should require a Kodesh urn and) the Urim v'Tumim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The brothers decide absolutely that the division should be according to the lottery. This helps as if they had the Urim v'Tumim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If two brothers divided an estate, and a third brother came from abroad, the division is void (they must make a new division);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> (The division stands.) Each brother gives a third of his share to the third brother (Rashbam; Tosfos - the third brother picks by lottery. We leave the initial division intact as much as possible (e.g. if the third brother picked a field which the other two would have shared, each of the other two keeps the fields he was supposed to get by himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> According to Rav, the division is void. This means that a division without the knowledge of one of the parties is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If so, if there were three partners or brothers, and two of them divided by themselves (in front of Beis Din), will we say that the division is invalid (Rashbam - if the third objects; Meiri - even if the third consents)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> That is different. There, they knew that there were three, and they picked portions accordingly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Rav's case, they thought that there were only two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> According to Shmuel, the division stands. This means that if a division gave the wrong amounts, it is valid (we just correct the amounts);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav and Shmuel taught that if Reuven sold to Shimon 'a Kor (of grain) for 30 (Sela'im)', either can retract until all is measured out! (Shmuel should say that what was measured is sold!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'a Kor for 30, each Se'ah for a Sela', after each Se'ah is measured out, neither can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> There, Chachamim enacted according to what the parties want, that they can retract until all is measured (in case the price changes).</p>
