<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CANCELLING GIFTS OF A SHECHIV MERA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Shechiv Mera (one who fears lest he die from his illness) gave a gift, until when can he cancel it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> He can cancel it as long as the parties are seated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> He can cancel it as long as they are engaged in the Kinyan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Yosef, for himself):</span> Rav Yehudah taught that if three men came to visit a sick man, they may write down his command, or execute it, whichever they want.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he can cancel a Kinyan as long as they are sitting, why can they execute his command? Perhaps he will cancel it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Kahana):</span> Rav Yehudah opposes also Rav Yosef. Why can they execute his command? We should be concerned lest the sick man retract!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yosef must say that they execute the command only after the sick man begins a new matter.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">114b----------------------------------------114b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rabah can similarly answer that they execute it only after they leave where they were sitting!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Halachah follows Rav Yosef regarding a field (12b), (beginning) a (new) matter (our law), and one who gives half his property to his wife and sons (143a). (Everywhere else (Tosfos - in Bava Basra) that Rabah argues with Rav Yosef, the Halachah follows Rabah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A WOMAN BEQUEATHS TO HER SON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman bequeaths to her son (and does not inherit him)...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was it needed to teach this? We already learned that a son inherits his mother, but does not bequeath to her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that a mother bequeaths to her son like to her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a husband does not inherit his wife when he is dead (to cause her property to pass to his heirs), also a son does not inherit his mother after his death to bequeath to his paternal brothers.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DOES A MOTHER INHERIT HER SON?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan citing R. Yehudah b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> Mid'Oraisa, a father inherits his son and a mother inherits her son, for it says "Matos";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This equates the tribes of the mother and father. Just like the father inherits the son, also the mother.</p>
