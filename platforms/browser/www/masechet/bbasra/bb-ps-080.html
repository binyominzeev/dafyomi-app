<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO BUYS THE YIELD OF A DOVECOTE OR HIVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven buys the offspring of Shimon's dovecote, Shimon retains the first litter of chicks (normally, a male and female);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he buys the offspring of Shimon's hive, he gets the first three litters of bees, (then) he (Shimon) is Mesares (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he buys the loaves of honey of the hive, Shimon retains two loaves (to sustain the bees in winter);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he buys the rights to cut Shimon's olive trees, he must leave Shimon two branches.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Contradiction:</span> Shimon retains the first two litters of chicks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> Regarding the first litter (and every litter that Shimon is entitled to keep), Shimon retains its first litter (i.e. its first offspring, lest the new mother leave Shimon to be with its offspring);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Counting from the mother of the first litter, Shimon retains also its second (and third and fourth...) generation of firstborn litters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Shimon retain the first litter of the first litter? Just like the mother will remain due to her offspring and her mate, the daughter will remain due to her mother and her mate!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A mother is insistent to remain with its offspring. Offspring are not insistent to remain with their mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he buys the offspring of Shimon's hive, he gets the first three litters of bees, (then) he is Mesares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Shimon Mesares (sterilize the bees)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> He gives to them mustard to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> This does not sterilize them. Rather, the sharp taste causes them to eat their honey;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Once satiated, they do not reproduce, rather, they make honey (Rashbam; R. Chananel - in the holes (where they ate the honey) new bees will be born next year. They belong to Shimon.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> Reuven is Mesares (alternates) when taking three litters, i.e. he gets the first, third and fifth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> Reuven takes the first three litters, and after this he is Mesares, i.e. alternates, and leaves every second litter for Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE TUM'AH OF HONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he buys the loaves of honey of the hive, Shimon retains two loaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> Honey (even) in a hive is always considered food. (It receives Tum'ah, even though sometimes it is likely that the bees will eat it, unless he designated it for the bees; alternatively - honey is considered food only in its hive, but if it flows out, it receives Tum'ah like a drink, unless he explicitly planned to eat it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that it receives Tum'ah even without intention (to eat it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Honey in a hive is neither a food nor a drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa refers to the two loaves (that sustain the bees in winter).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Beraisa is like R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">80b----------------------------------------80b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> A beehive is like land. We may write a Pruzbul if the borrower has a beehive, it cannot become Tamei in its place, and one who takes honey from it on Shabbos (b'Shogeg) brings a Korban Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, it is not like land. We may not write a Pruzbul unless the borrower has proper land, it can become Tamei in its place, one who takes honey from it on Shabbos is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> R. Eliezer learns from "va'Yitbol Osah b'Ya'aros ha'Devash";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are forests mentioned in connection with honey?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like uprooting from a forest is a Melachah, also taking honey from a hive is a Melachah (because the Torah considers it attached. Therefore, it does not receive Tum'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Honey that flows from a hive is neither a food nor a drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not difficult for Abaye. He can say that the Beraisa discusses the two loaves. Since they did not receive Tum'ah in the hive, they do not receive Tum'ah when they flow out (until he intends to eat them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, this is difficult for Rava!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zvid):</span> The case is, it flowed onto a repulsive Keli (it is unlikely that one will eat it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> The case is, it flowed onto chips of wood (great toil would be needed to gather it to eat it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Honey in a hive is neither a food nor a drink;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he had intention to eat it, it receives Tum'ah like a food. If he had intention to drink it, it receives Tum'ah like a drink,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Abaye can say that the Beraisa discusses the two loaves;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>However, this is difficult for Rava!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means 'it is not a food, i.e. that intent to eat it makes it receive Tum'ah like a food. It is not a drink, that intent to drink it makes it receive Tum'ah like a drink.' (Rather, it never receives Tum'ah. This is like R. Eliezer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Kahana - Beraisa):</span> Honey in a hive receives Tum'ah like a food, even without intention to eat it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO BUYS THE RIGHT TO CUT TREES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he buys the rights to cut Shimon's olive trees, he must leave Shimon two branches.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one buys a tree to cut, he must leave a Tefach (for the original owner, from which the tree will regenerate);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For a virgin sycamore tree (it was never pruned), he must leave three Tefachim. For a (pruned) sycamore stump, he must leave two Tefachim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For reeds and vines, he must cut above the bulge (from which they branch out);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>For date trees and cedar trees, he digs and uproots the entire tree, for the stump will never grow back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> A virgin sycamore does not need three Tefachim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not cut a virgin sycamore in Shemitah, for this promotes its growth;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, one may not cut it normally. Either he leaves 10 Tefachim, or cuts the entire stump.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Cutting the entire stump is detrimental. Leaving any amount is beneficial (it will grow back)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Leaving three Tefachim is beneficial (it will grow back). Cutting the entire stump is detrimental,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Leaving something less than three Tefachim is neither beneficial nor harmful;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In Shemitah, we cut in a harmful way. For business, we cut in a beneficial way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> For reeds and vines, he must cut above the bulge;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For date trees and cedar trees, he digs and uproots the entire tree, for the stump will never grow back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that cedar stump will never grow back?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Lulaini):</span> "Tzadik ka'Tamar Yifrrach k'Erez..." - why are Tzadikim compared to date and cedar trees?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> Had it mentioned only cedar trees, one might have thought that Tzadikim do not yield fruits;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If it only mentioned date trees, one might have thought that Tzadikim do not regenerate (they die without righteous children; alternatively, if they fall, they do not get up).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses different types of cedars, in which the stumps do not grow back.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> There are 10 types of cedars: "Erez (cedar) Shitah (pine) va'Hadas (myrtle) v'Etz Shemen (balsam)...Berosh (box tree) Tidhar (teak?) u'S'ashur (?)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> These are only seven!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> There are also Alonim (pistachio), Almonim (oak) and Almugim (coral).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> There are also Aronim (laurel), Armonim (chestnut) and Almugim.</p>
