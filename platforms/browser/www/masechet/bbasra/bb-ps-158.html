<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA BASRA 158 - A week of learning has been dedicated towards meriting a Refu'ah Sheleimah for Eliezer Lipa ben Yetta, by Mr. and Mrs. Kornfeld of Yerushalayim. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A DOUBT ABOUT WHO DIED FIRST</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If a house fell on Reuven and his wife, and Reuven's heirs say that she died first (so Reuven inherited all her property), and her heirs say that he died first (so they inherit her property and her Kesuvah), they divide the disputed amount;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel say, we leave the property in its Chazakah (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His heirs are Muchzak in the Kesuvah. Her father's heirs are Muchzak in the (Melug) property that she brought into the marriage and gets back (without compensation if she is widowed or divorced).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">158b----------------------------------------158b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is Muchzak in the property? (Beis Hillel specified who is Muchzak in the Kesuvah and Nichsei Melug, so 'the property' must refer to Tzon Barzel, i.e. property she brought into the marriage and he accepted to return its initial value if she is widowed or divorced.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> His heirs are Muchzak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> Her heirs are Muchzak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Reish Lakish):</span> The heirs of both divide it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support.	(Bar Kapara - Beraisa):</span> Since both have a claim to inherit, they divide it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a house fell on Reuven and his mother (we do not know who died first. If she died first, he inherited her). Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that his heirs divide her property with her heirs;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Akiva says, here also, Beis Hillel say that we leave the property in its Chazakah (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Ben Azai:</span> It is bad enough that they argue in the previous Mishnah. Must you make an argument also here?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is Muchzak in her property?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ila):</span> Her heirs are Muchzak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Zeira):</span> His heirs are Muchzak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>When R. Zeira went to Eretz Yisrael, he retracted, and held like R. Ila.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> This shows that the air of Eretz Yisrael makes one wise.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Ila's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The property is Muchzak in her tribe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Reish Lakish):</span> The heirs of both divide it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Ben Azai):</span> It is bad enough that they argue in the previous Mishnah, must you make an argument here also?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Simla'i):</span> Since he said 'you' (and not 'Rabbeinu'), we learn from this that Ben Azai was a Talmid (who later became a) Chaver of R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A DIFFICULT MONETARY LAW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> If Reuven borrowed from his father (Yakov) in Yakov's lifetime, and he died; Reuven takes from the buyers (this will be corrected and explained). This is among the most difficult monetary laws.</p>
