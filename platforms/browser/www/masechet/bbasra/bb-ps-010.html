<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE REWARD OF TZEDAKAH (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> One who regularly gives Tzedakah will merit to have children with Chachmah, wealth, and who know Agada (non-Halachic teachings).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachmah - it (the above verse) says "Yimtza Chayim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Wealth - it says "(they will be able to give) Tzedakah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Agadah - it says here "v'Chavod", like it says "Kavod Chachamim Yinchalu" (people who expound Agadah are greatly respected).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> If Hash-m loves the poor, why doesn't He feed them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Meir):</span> It is to allow people to give Tzedakah and escape Gehinom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Turnusrufus asked this of R. Akiva, and received the same answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Turnusrufus:</span> Just the contrary! This is like a king who put his servant in jail and commanded not to feed him, and someone fed him. The king will be angry!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>You are called His servants - "Ki Li Venei Yisrael Avadim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> This is like a king who was angry at his son and put him in jail and commanded not to feed him, and someone fed him. The king will send that man a gift!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We are called His children - "Banim Atem la'Shem Elokeichem".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Turnusrufus:</span> You are called slaves and children. When you do His will, you are children. When not, you are slaves;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Now, you are not doing His will, so you are slaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> "Paros la'Ra'ev Lachmecha" discusses a time such as now, when "v'Aniyim Merudim Tavi Vayis", and it commands to feed the hungry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah b'Rebbi Shalom):</span> Just like one's income is fixed on Rosh Hashanah for the year, his losses (expenditures) for the year are fixed then;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he merits, his expenditures will be for Tzedakah. If not, Romi will take the money ("v'Aniyim Merudim").</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan Ben Zakai saw in a dream that his nephews would lose 700 Dinarim in the year. He pressed them to give Tzedakah, and induced them to give all but 17 of the 700. On the night before Yom Kipur, officers of the Kaiser came. (His nephews feared lest they take a great sum.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan Ben Zakai:</span> Don't worry. They will take only the last 17 Dinarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He explained how he knew. His nephews asked why he didn't tell them about the dream.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan Ben Zakai:</span> I wanted you to give for the sake of the Mitzvah, without knowing that you were destined to lose the money anyway.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Papa was alighting a ladder. His leg slipped, and he was about to fall. He lamented that he would die from being cast to the ground, similar to death by stoning, the punishment for desecration of Shabbos or idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chiya bar Rav mi'Difti:</span> Perhaps a poor person came to you and you did not give to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> Seeing one who needs Tzedakah and overlooking him is like idolatry:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It says "Bliya'al" regarding refraining from lending money, like it says about idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> All Tzedakah and Chesed that Yisrael do in this world causes great Shalom with Hash-m and advocating angels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Great is Tzedakah, for it brings the redemption close.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah: Ten things were created in the world that are Kasheh (hard, or unyielding):</span> a mountain is Kasheh, but iron can cut it; iron is Kasheh, but fire melts it; fire is Kasheh, but water extinguishes it; water is Kasheh, but the clouds bear it; clouds are Kasheh, but wind scatters them; wind is Kasheh, but the body contains it; the body is Kasheh, but fear breaks it; fear is Kasheh, but wine dispels it; wine is Kasheh, but sleep negates its effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Death is more Kasheh than all of these, and "u'Tzdakah Tatzil mi'Maves."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Dosta'i b'Rebbi Yanai):</span> Hash-m's ways are unlike people' ways!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one gives a big gift to a mortal king, he is unsure whether the king will accept it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even if he accepts it, the giver is not sure whether he will get to see the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who gives a Perutah to Tzedakah receives the Divine Presence - "b'Tzedek Echezeh Fanecha".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Elazar would give a Perutah to Tzedakah before praying - "b'Tzedek Echezeh Fanecha".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the continuation mean - "Esbe'ah v'Hakitz Temunasecha?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> This refers to Chachamim, who deny themselves sleep in this world, and Hash-m is Masbi'a (satiates) them with His presence in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Malve Hash-m Chonen Dal" - if not for the verse, it would be forbidden to say such a thing!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m considers Himself to be like a borrower (who is like a slave) to one who gives Tzedakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It says "Lo Yo'il Hon b'Yom Evrah u'Tzdakah Tatzil mi'Maves"; and "Lo Yo'ilu Otzeros Resha u'Tzdakah Tatzil mi'Maves";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it mention two Tzedakos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One saves from a harsh death, and one saves from judgment in Gehinom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which saves from judgment in Gehinom?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The one about which it says "Evrah" - "Yom Evrah ha'Yom ha'Hu".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Giving without knowing to whom he gives, in a way that the receiver does not know from whom he receives, saves (Tosfos - from judgment in Gehinom, and even) from a harsh death.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can one give Tzedakah in this way?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He gives to the pouch of Tzedakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> To merit male children, one should distribute his money to the poor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehoshua says, he should make his wife joyful before relations;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, one should not give a Perutah to the Tzedakah pouch unless the one appointed over it is as trustworthy as R. Chanina ben Tradyon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the counsel to give to the pouch of Tzedakah is when someone as trustworthy as R. Chanina ben Tradyon is appointed over it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE STATUS OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TO COME</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Moshe asked Hash-m what will glorify Yisrael. Hash-m answered "Ki Sisa (every Yisrael will give a half-Shekel)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> People asked Shlomo how great is the power of Tzedakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shlomo:</span> "Pizar Nasan la'Evyonim Tzidkaso Omedes la'Ad".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> We may learn from "Maromim Yishkon...(because) Lachmo Nitan".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> People asked Shlomo ha'Melech who is (characterized as) a person of the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shlomo:</span> "V'Neged Zekenav Kavod".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehoshua's son Yosef left this world and returned. He recounted what he saw.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Yosef:</span> I saw an upside-down world. (Rich) people on top here are below there, and vice-versa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> What you saw is reality! How did Chachamim look?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Yosef:</span> They are just as important as they are here;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They were saying 'happy is the one who comes to the world to come and remembers his learning.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>They also said that no one else has a standing like those (who sanctified Hash-m's name when) killed by the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which people did this refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to R. Akiva and the other (nine awesome) Chachamim killed by the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even if they were not killed by the king, no one could compare to them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it referred to those killed in Lud. (Two brothers confessed to a false accusation that the king planned to use as a pretext to kill all the Yisraelim.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TZEDAKAH OF NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yochanan Ben Zakai) Question:</span> What is the meaning of "Tzedakah Teromem Goy v'Chesed l'Umim Chatas"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Eliezer):</span> Tzedakah elevates Yisrael, but it is a sin for Nochrim, for they give only to aggrandize themselves;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"(Daryavesh gave in order that) l'Chayei Malka u'Vnohi".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may give Tzedakah this way!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who says 'I give this Sela to Tzedakah in order that my son should live', or 'in order that I will merit the world to come" is a perfect Tzadik.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is for Yisrael, but not for Nochrim (for if they do not get their request, they regret the whole matter).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehoshua):</span> Tzedakah elevates Yisrael, but it is a sin for Nochrim, for they give only to prolong their reign;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Nebuchadnetzar gave in order that) "v'Chata'ach b'Tzidkah Feruk (he will redeem his sin through Tzedakah)... Teheve Archah li'Shlevsach (and he will have serenity for a long time)";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Gamliel):</span> Tzedakah elevates Yisrael, but it is a sin for Nochrim, for they give only to be haughty;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Every haughty person falls to Gehinom - "Zed Yahir...b'Evras Zadon" ("Evras" refers to Gehinom, as above).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Eliezer ha'Moda'ai):</span> Tzedakah elevates Yisrael, but it is a sin for Nochrim, for they give only to revile Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(When Nevuzaradan (Nebuchadnetzar's chief executioner) released Yirmeyahu (or was zealous for Hash-m), he said) "Ki Chatasem la'Shem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (R. Nechunyah ben ha'Kaneh):</span> Tzedakah and Chesed elevate Yisrael, but they are a sin for Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan Ben Zakai:</span> R. Nechunyah's answer is the better than my answer and all of yours, for he explains that Tzedakah and Chesed refer to Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did R. Yochanan Ben Zakai himself answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yochanan Ben Zakai):</span> Just like a Chatas offering atones for Yisrael, Tzedakah atones for Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The mother of Shevor Malka sent 400 Dinarim to R. Ami. He did not accept. She sent to Rava, and he accepted, for the sake of Shalom with the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Ami heard of this and was disturbed. Doesn't Rava agree that "bi'Vosh Ketzirah Tishavarna (when the king's merits are used up, he will fall)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava accepted for the sake of Shalom with the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Isn't R. Ami also concerned for Shalom with the king?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One could accept the money and give it to Nochrim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Indeed, Rava did so!</p>
