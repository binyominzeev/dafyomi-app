<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RABAH IS REFUTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he did not give it in front of witnesses. Reuven did not see his garment by Shimon, therefore Shimon is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Mishnah):</span> A craftsman does not get a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Someone else gets a Chazakah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If witnesses saw that the object was deposited, why would someone else get a Chazakah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, there aren't witnesses that saw the object deposited, and even so a craftsman does not get a Chazakah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This refutes Rabah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO GOT BACK THE WRONG GARMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven took back his garment from the craftsman, and saw that it is someone else's, Reuven may use it until the owner comes for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he took back someone else's garment from a mourner's house or a drinking house, he may not use it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the cases?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav citing R. Chiya):</span> A person often tells a craftsman to sell his garment. (Rashbam - we assume that Ploni did so, and the craftsman mistakenly sold Reuven's, and knowingly gave Ploni's garment to Reuven until he can get Reuven's garment back to him; Tosfos - he intended that Reuven keep Ploni's garment in place of his own.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya brei d'Rav Nachman):</span> This is only if the craftsman returned another's Keli, but not if the craftsman's wife or children did so;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even when the craftsman returns it, this is only when he said '(take this) garment', but not if he said '<i>your</i> garment.' (Then, surely he thinks that he is returning Reuven's.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A SWINDLING CRAFTSMAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is a ruse of swindlers of Pumbedisa. Shimon claims his garment from Levi (a swindling craftsman), who denies that he ever received it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> I have witnesses who saw it by you. It is mine! (The witnesses are unsure about this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> That was another's garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> Show it, and we will see whose it is!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> I refuse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Levi justifiably refuses! The Beraisa says that Shimon gets his garment only if witnesses saw it (and knew that it was Shimon's) with the craftsman.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> If Shimon is clever, he will induce Levi to show it. He will say (in private) 'you are holding it because I owe you. Let us have experts appraise it, you will get what I owe you, I will get what is mine (i.e. the excess)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rav Avya):</span> Levi can say 'I already had it appraised (it is not worth more than you owe me).'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CHAZAKAH OF A SHARECROPPER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A sharecropper gets no Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason? Formerly, he only received a portion of the Peros. Now that he has taken all the Peros for three years, this shows that he owns the field!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The case is, his family has always been sharecroppers on the field. (It is common for such sharecroppers to eat all the Peros for some years, and then the owners eat all the Peros in other years.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If a sharecropper hired sharecroppers to work the field (by themselves for three years), he has a Chazakah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If an owner saw someone else appoint sharecroppers over his field, he would speak up!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a sharecropper hired sharecroppers to help him work the field, he gets no Chazakah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps the owner authorized him to do so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>FACTORS THAT MAKE ONE IMPARTIAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> Can a sharecropper testify about who owns the field (or is he considered partial)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Shmuel said that he can.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> He cannot testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses when the fruit is still in the field (the sharecropper did not yet get his share, so he would gain from his testimony). Shmuel discusses when he already took his share.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An Arev (guarantor) can testify that the borrower owns a certain land (e.g. someone else claims the land);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if the borrower owns other land (sufficient to pay the debt, so in any case the Arev expect that he himself will not need to pay).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The lender can testify that the borrower owns a certain land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if the borrower owns other land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If Reuven bought land from Levi, and then Shimon bought from Levi, Reuven can testify that Levi truly owned what he sold to Shimon, only if Levi has other land. (If not, Reuven gains from his testimony. Tosfos - if we will find out that Reuven bought stolen land, he will be able to get back what he paid from Shimon's land; Rashbam - his testimony causes that Levi's creditor will collect Shimon's land, and not Reuven's).</p>
