<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ARE DITCHES AND ROCKS CONSIDERED PART OF A FIELD? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (When they are 10, granted they are judged separately from the field, but still) they should be redeemed according to the fixed price!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The fixed redemption price does not apply to fields less than a Beis Kor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Zera Chomer Se'orim" is the smallest quantity redeemed according to the fixed price!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Im Ga'ol Yig'al Es <i>ha'Sadeh</i>" teaches that a field of any size is redeemed according to the fixed price.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ukva bar Chama):</span> The case is, the ditches are full of water, and cannot be sown (therefore they are not redeemed like fields).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> They are mentioned along with rocks. This implies that they are like rocks, which cannot be sown.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even if they are less than 10 Tefachim they should not be like the field!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ditches are like cracks of the field. Small rocks are like mounds of the field. Neither of these are considered by themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are the ditches in our Mishnah full of water?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Even if they are not full of water (they are not included).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One does not pay money for (one place that looks like) two or three places.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> They are mentioned along with rocks, which cannot be sown, presumably the ditches are similar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are like rocks when they are less than 10 Tefachim. Then, they are like part of the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> The small rocks (and ditches) are considered like the field when they are at most four Kavim (of the Beis Kor. If they are more than this, the buyer does not accept them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ukva bar Chama):</span> They are like the field only if they are spread out over at least five Kavim. If not, they are not included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> They are like the field only if they are spread out over the majority of the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> When the four Kavim are spread out over the majority of the field (e.g. 16 Beis Se'im in a Beis Kor) , if most of the four Kavim are spread out over the minority (of these 16 Se'im, e.g. seven Se'im), and the minority of the four Kavim are spread out over the majority of this majority (nine Se'im), what is the law? (Do we say that since they are too concentrated in one area, they are not Batel?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">103b----------------------------------------103b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> What is the law if they are spread out over the proper area, but they are arranged in a circle (making it hard to sow between them), or in a row, or like an ox's horns, or in a zigzag (Each shape is harder to sow than the previous)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>These questions are not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ROCKS THAT ARE EXCLUDED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashbam (Beraisa):</span> One rock of any size outside the field is not included;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - (Beraisa):</span> A rock that has a name, of any size (alternatively - a rock that is a Beis Rova (about 104 square Amos)) is not included. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A rock on the border is not included (it must be inside the field).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If a small amount of earth is between the rock and the border, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> (If we consider the rock to be in the field when some earth separates it from the border), if the earth (between it and the border) is under a rock, or has a rock under it, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE LAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'I sell to you a Beis Kor, measured by a rope', if it is any amount less, Shimon deducts from the price. If it is any amount more, Shimon returns the extra (land or money).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'be it less or more', even if there is a Rova too little or much per Se'ah, there is no compensation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the error is more than this, he must return (everything).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>When Shimon must return, he returns money. If he (Reuven) wants, he returns land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We say that he returns money to help Reuven. If the extra is Beis nine Kavim in a field (which is worthwhile, it is considered a field), or half a Kav in a garden, or according to R. Akiva a Beis Rova, Reuven will (presumably) ask for land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>He does not just return the Rova. He returns all the extra land.</p>
