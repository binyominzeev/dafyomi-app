<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>KIDUSHIN THAT DOES NOT RESULT IN NISU'IN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The case is, Moshe rejoiced with Reuven for the seven days of celebration, and before he returned the Shushvinus, Reuven died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about whether one may say 'give to me my husband, and I will rejoice with him'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Noson):</span> If one was Mekadesh a woman (and he died or divorced her), if she was a virgin, she collects (a Kesuvah of) 200. If not, she collects 100;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In a place where the custom is to return Kidushin money, we return it. Where it is not returned, we do not return it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi says, a tradition from Moshe from Sinai teaches that in a place where the custom is to return it, we return it. Where it is not returned, we do not return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi is just like R. Noson!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about whether she may say 'give to me my husband, and I will rejoice with him'. The Beraisa is abbreviated, it should say as follows. R. Noson says, if one is Mekadesh a woman, if she was a virgin she collects 200; if not, she collects 100;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is only if he retracted. If she died, in a place where the custom is to return Kidushin money, we return it. Where it is not returned, we do not return it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>This is only if she died. If he died, she may say 'give to me my husband, and I will rejoice with him'.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Rebbi says, whether he or she died, a tradition from Sinai teaches that in a place where the custom is to return it, we return it. Where it is not returned, we do not return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>(In a place where they return it,) she cannot say 'give to me my husband, and I will rejoice with him'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2):</span> No, all agree that she can say 'give to me my husband....' When he died, all agree that she keeps the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue in a case when she died, about whether Kidushin money is given l'Tivu'in (to stay, even if she dies before Nisu'in);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Noson says, Kidushin money is not given l'Tivu'in. Rebbi says that it is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> In a place where the custom is to return it, we return it; where it is not returned, we do not return it'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi means that regarding Savlonos (gifts that a Chasan gives to the Kalah during Eirusin), in a place where the custom is to return them, we return them. Where they are not returned, we do not return them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Noson and Rebbi argue as the following Tana'im argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Shimon was Mekadesh Leah with a Kikar (2500 Zuz), if she was a virgin, she collects 200. If not, she collects 100 (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, a virgin keeps 200, and a widow keeps 100. She returns the rest;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi says, if he was Mekadesh with 80 Zuz, he gives to her half of 120. If he was Mekadesh with 120 Zuz, he gives to her half of 80 (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she died, the Kesuvah is not paid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why does R. Yehudah say that she returns the rest? Why can't she say 'give to me my husband...'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Shimon is a Yisrael. Leah had Bi'ah with another man (and became forbidden to him).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If she willingly had Bi'ah, she does not receive a Kesuvah. If she was raped, she is permitted to Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, Shimon is a Kohen. Leah was raped. The Tana'im argue about whether or not Kidushin money is given l'Tivu'in;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Meir holds that it is given l'Tivu'in. R. Yehudah holds that it is not. R. Yosi is in doubt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Therefore, according to R. Yosi, half the Kidushin money counts towards payment of the Kesuvah (for we are unsure whether Kidushin money must be returned);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>(He discusses a widow.) If Shimon was Mekadesh with 80 Zuz, 40 counts towards the Kesuvah, so he owes her another 60. If he was Mekadesh with 120 Zuz, 60 counts towards the Kesuvah, so he owes another 40.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef bar Minyomi):</span> Wherever the custom is to return, we return.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He refers to Neharde'a.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the custom in the rest of Bavel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> Moharei (Savlonos that will be written in the Kesuvah) are returned. Kidushin money is not returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The Halachah is, whether he or she died or he retracted, Moharei are returned, but Kidushin money is not returned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she retracted, also Kidushin money is returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> Kidushin money is not returned. This is a decree lest people say that the Kidushin was mistaken (and never took effect), and that he can be Mekadesh (and marry) her sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> We are not concerned for this. Since he gives a Get, all know that he cannot be Mekadesh her sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is wrong. Perhaps someone heard that the Kidushin money was returned, but did not hear about the Get.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COLLECTING SHUSHVINUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shushvinus can be collected in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Five laws were said about Shushvinus: it can be collected in Beis Din, it is repaid at the proper time (when the giver gets married), we are not concerned for Ribis, it is not cancelled in Shemitah, and a firstborn does not receive a double portion of it.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">145b----------------------------------------145b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can it be collected in Beis Din?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like a loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>We are not concerned for Ribis, because the giver does not care if more or less is returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>It is not cancelled in Shemitah, because "Lo Yigos (do not demand payment) does not apply (R. Tam - because it is not due until the giver gets married; Ri - for perhaps he will never need to repay it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A firstborn does not receive a double portion of it, because it is Ra'uy, and a firstborn receives a double portion only in what is Muchzak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If the one who received (Moshe) was in the city when the giver (Reuven) got married, he must come (if he did not, Reuven may collect it in Beis Din);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Moshe heard bells signifying the festivities, he must come. If he did not hear them, Reuven should have informed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven did not inform him, Moshe has gripes against Reuven, but in any case he must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much must he pay? (Surely, he need not pay the full amount, for Moshe did not eat Reuven's food.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The custom is, if Reuven brought up to one Zuz to Moshe, presumably he ate this amount, so Moshe need not return anything;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven brought up to four Zuzim, presumably Moshe served to him half, so Moshe returns half;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven brought more than four Zuzim, Moshe deducts based on how important Reuven is. (A distinguished person is served more expensive food.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven rejoiced with Moshe publicly, and Reuven's celebration will be modest, Moshe can say 'I want to rejoice with you publicly, like you did with me';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If (Reuven rejoiced with Moshe when) Moshe married a virgin, and Reuven married a widow, Moshe can say 'I will rejoice with you when you marry a virgin, like I did';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If (Reuven rejoiced with Moshe when) Moshe married his second wife, and Reuven married his first wife, Moshe can say 'I will rejoice with you when you marry your second wife, as I did (I need not rejoice with you in a bigger celebration than you did with me).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text):</span> If Moshe married one woman, and Reuven will marry two and wants Moshe to return half each time, Moshe can say 'I will rejoice with you once, like you did with me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rivam):</span> If Reuven rejoiced with Moshe twice, and Reuven is marrying one woman and wants Moshe to return both, Moshe can say 'I will return half now, and the rest when you marry a second wife, like you did with me'.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who knows Agados is like one with much land and known possessions (he becomes famous, for he can expound anywhere);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A master of Pilpul (delving deeply into Torah) is like a moneychanger with coins and one who owns land that yields choice olives (he constantly profits);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who knows teachings is like one with wealth stored up. When the time comes, he profits;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who knows Gemara (to resolve difficulties of Mishnayos and Beraisos), he is like the one who sells wheat. Everyone needs him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> "Kol Yemei Oni Ra'im" refers to one who learns Gemara (he always has difficulties);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Tov Lev Mishteh Samid" refers to one who learns only Mishnah (he does not encounter difficulties).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> To the contrary! One who only learns Mishnah can never give a ruling. One who learns Gemara can give rulings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mesharshiya):</span> "Masi'a Avanim Ye'atzev Bahem" refers to one who learns only Mishnah. "Boke'a Etzim Yisachen Bam" is one who learns Gemara (he is warmed (benefits from) his learning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> "Kol Yemei Oni Ra'im" refers to one who has a bad wife. "V'Tov Lev Mishteh Samid" refers to one who has a good wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> "Kol Yemei Oni Ra'im" refers to an Istenis (a very sensitive person);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Tov Lev Mishteh Samid" refers to one who is not sensitive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Kol Yemei Oni Ra'im" refers to a merciful person (he is always upset by other people's problems);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Tov Lev Mishteh Samid" refers to one who has no mercy on others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> "Kol Yemei Oni Ra'im" refers to an irritable person;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Tov Lev Mishteh Samid" refers to one who is easygoing.</p>
