<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MATTERS THAT REQUIRE TWO PEOPLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava citing Rav Nachman):</span> Macha'ah must be made in front of two people. He need not tell them to write (a document, they can write it on their own, since this benefits him, it gives him proof that he protested);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moda'ah (one who is being forced to sell or give his property informs witnesses beforehand that he acts unwillingly, and intends to reclaim his property when the Ones no longer applies) must be made in front of two people. He need not tell them to write it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Admission (I, Reuven, owe Ploni) must be made in front of two people. He must tell them to write it (for this hurts Reuven. Ploni could use the document to 'prove' that he was never paid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Kinyan (Chalipin) can be done in front of two (Tosfos - or even without any onlookers). The giver need not tell them to write it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Validation of documents must be in front of three judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> How do we understand Chalipin?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If (he need not tell them to write because) it is considered an act of Beis Din (Beis Din has the power to enact, even if it hurts a party), it should require three (like all acts of Beis Din)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is not considered an act of Beis Din, he should have to tell them to write it (for this hurts the giver)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Really, it is not considered an act of Beis Din. He need not tell them to write it, since he used Chalipin in order that the receiver will acquire immediately, so we assume that he wants the document to be written.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MODA'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> We write a Moda'ah only against one who does not obey Beis Din (otherwise, he should ask Beis Din to prevent the Ones).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> Moda'ah may be written against people such as ourselves (who obey Beis Din. Sometimes, Beis Din is not available to prevent the Ones).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Neharde'a):</span> If the witnesses on a Moda'ah did not write 'we know the Ones', it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">40b----------------------------------------40b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Moda'ah about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is a Moda'ah to invalidate a Get or gift, surely he is Anus! (Since the giver does not receive anything, Ones is the only reason he would give the document if he does not want it to take effect.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is about a sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rava taught that we do not write a Moda'ah about a sale!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, It is about a sale. Rava admits when there is an Ones, like the following case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven's orchard was a Mashkanta to Shimon for three years. After three years, Shimon threatened 'if you do not sell it to me, I will conceal the Mashkanta document and claim that I bought it.' (He would be believed, because he had a Chazakah, i.e. Reuven never protested.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One cannot collect with a concealed gift document. (Perhaps it was only intended to be a Moda'ah (to invalidate a second document that will be written for the same property), or the property was already given to someone else).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a concealed gift document?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The giver told the witnesses 'seclude yourselves and write it.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> He did not tell the witnesses 'write it in the market, in public view.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about one who gave no instructions where to write it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It does work like a Moda'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Rava did not say this explicitly. Rather, it was inferred from the following.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven wanted to be Mekadesh Leah. She agreed to accept only if he will write all his property to her; he agreed. Reuven's oldest son complained to him (before the document was written) 'what will I inherit?!' Reuven commanded witnesses to hide themselves and write his property to his son.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Neither the son nor Leah acquires the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Someone heard this ruling, and assumed that it is because a concealed gift works like a Moda'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, Rava ruled like this only in this case, for it is evident that Reuven did not want to give to Leah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In a case where the unconcealed gift was given willingly, this shows that the giver wants it to be valid. The concealed gift is not a Moda'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law when he gave no instructions where to write it? (I.e. which version does the Halachah follow?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> The document is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> It is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah is, it is invalid.</p>
