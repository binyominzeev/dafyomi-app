<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES <i>MESIRAH</i> SUFFICE TO TRANSFER A DOCUMENT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye and Rabah - Beraisa):</span> Just like no one can use a document to claim money from either of them, neither of them can use a document to claim money from someone else.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do the Tana of our Mishnah and the Tana of this Beraisa argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> (Neither is concerned lest one dropped it and his namesake found it.) They argue about whether or not a document is acquired by Mesirah (handing it over):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Tana of our Mishnah holds that a document is acquired by Mesirah. (If one gave it to the other, the bearer is entitled to collect);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The Tana of the Beraisa holds that a document is not acquired by Mesirah (if the bearer received it from his namesake, this does not entitle him to collect).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> All agree that a document is acquired by Mesirah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They argue about whether the bearer must prove that it was given to him. The Tana of our Mishnah does not require him to bring proof, the Tana of the Beraisa requires him to bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> A document is acquired by Mesirah. The bearer must prove that it was given to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The bearer need not prove that it was given to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Support (Abaye, for himself - Beraisa):</span> If Yehudah is holding a loan document, and he claims that his brothers gave it to him, and they claim that he grabbed it. he must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Also in general, the bearer must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> No, this applies only to brothers, for they often take things from each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Support (Rava, for himself - Beraisa):</span> If Yehudah is holding a loan document, and he claims that his brothers gave it to him, and they claim that he grabbed it. he must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This applies only to brothers, for they often take things from each other. Normally, the bearer need not bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> No, it applies to everyone. The Beraisa discusses brothers, for this is a Chidush;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since they often take things from each other, they guard documents from each other. One might have thought that Yehudah need not bring proof. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOCUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST NAMESAKES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Just like either of them can use a document to claim money from someone else, one of them can use a document to collect from the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why does this Tana argue with the Tana of our Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether we write a document for the borrower in the absence of the lender;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana of our Mishnah holds that we write a document for the borrower in the absence of the lender. Perhaps the bearer asked a scribe and witnesses to write a document for him to borrow from his namesake, and now he claims that he lent to his namesake. (Therefore, he cannot collect.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Tana of the Beraisa holds that we do not write a document for the borrower in the absence of the lender.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Levi found among his documents a note saying 'the document of Yosef ben Shimon was paid', he cannot collect a loan from either of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he not found this receipt, he could have collected.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> No one can use a document to claim money from either of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The case is, Levi's documents have the grandfather's name (proving to which one he lent).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The grandfather indicates which one paid his loan!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Hoshaya):</span> The case is, the loan documents have the grandfather's name,but the receipt does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah means, if Levi found among his documents a note saying 'the document with which I borrowed from Yosef ben Shimon was paid', neither can collect a loan from him (neither can prove that his document was not paid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Documents for them should include the grandfather's name...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If their grandfathers had the same name, and both are Kohanim (or Yisraelim), we write more ancestors (until we distinguish them).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A DOUBT ABOUT WHICH DOCUMENT WAS PAID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven told his son 'one of my documents was paid. I do not know which', his son cannot collect any of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If two documents were against the same person, he may collect the smaller, but not the larger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava):</span> If Shimon told Levi 'one of my documents (against you) was paid', he may collect the smaller, but not the larger;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'your debt to me was paid', he cannot collect any document against him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If so, will you say that if a document said 'my field is sold to you', the larger field is sold, and if it says 'the field that I have is sold to you', all his fields are sold?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> No. The bearer of a document has the lower hand.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>COLLECTING FROM AN AREV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven lent to Shimon, and Levi was an Arev (guarantor), Reuven may not collect from Levi.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">173b----------------------------------------173</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven stipulated (at the time of the loan) 'on condition that I can collect from whichever of you I want', he can collect from Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if Shimon has property, in any case Reuven cannot collect from Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Similarly, R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if Yehudah was an Arev for David (in case David will need) to pay his wife's Kesuvah, and he is divorcing her, David must vow Al Da'as Rabim (according to the will of many others, so the vow cannot be annulled) that he will not benefit from her, lest the divorce is just a scheme to collect from Yehudah, and David plans to remarry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why can't he collect from the Arev?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> The Arev can say 'I took responsibility only in case Shimon will die or flee. He is here!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> That is like Persian law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Just the contrary! The Persians collect from the Arev first!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means that is like the Persian law, i.e. it is illogical.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> The Mishnah means that he may not collect from Levi <i>first</i>.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven lent to Shimon, and Levi was an Arev, Reuven may not claim from Levi first;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven stipulated 'on condition that I can collect from whichever of you I want', he can claim from Levi first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna):</span> What is the source that an Arev becomes obligated?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> "Anochi E'ervenu" (Yehudah was an Arev for Binyamin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Chisda):</span> This was not regular Arvus, rather Kablanus (a special kind of Arvus, as if he himself received the loan, like Reuven had offered) - "Tenah Oso Al Yadi va'Ani Ashivenu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yitzchak):</span> It says "Lekach Bigdo Ki Arev Zar", and "Beni Im Aravta... Nokashta v'Imrei Ficha... Lech Hisrapes u'Rhav Re'echa";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If you owe him money (on behalf of the borrower), pay him. If not (rather, you insulted him), bring friends to request his pardon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> R. Yehudah and R. Yosi argue about whether an Arev becomes obligated:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi says that Asmachta (an exaggerated promise) is binding, and also an Arev becomes obligated (he does not benefit, yet he accepts to pay if the borrower will not);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says that Asmachta is not binding, so an Arev does not become obligated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> We rule that Asmachta is not binding, yet an Arev becomes obligated!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Arvus is not Asmachta. The Arev benefits. Since the lender trusts him (and lends the borrower due to the Arev), he decides absolutely to accept responsibility as if he himself borrowed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven stipulated 'on condition that I can collect from whichever of you I want'...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This is only if Shimon has no property. If he has, Reuven cannot collect from Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If Shimon has property, in any case Reuven cannot collect from Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The first Tana holds that even in this case, he can collect from Levi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows. If Reuven lent to Shimon, and Levi was an Arev, Reuven may not collect from Levi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven stipulated 'on condition that I can collect from whichever of you I want', he can collect from Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is if Shimon has no property. If he has, Reuven cannot collect from Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Levi is a Kablan, even if Shimon has property, Reuven can collect from Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if Shimon has property, Reuven cannot collect from an Arev nor from a Kablan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The Halachah always follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel in a Mishnah, with three exceptions: our Mishnah about an Arev, the case of a conditional Get in Tzidon, and a litigant who thought that he did not have a proof, and later found one.</p>
