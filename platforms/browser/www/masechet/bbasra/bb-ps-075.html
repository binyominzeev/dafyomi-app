<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE END OF LIVYASAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> Gavri'el will fight Livyasan (Rashba - to end this world when its allotted time expires) - "Timshoch Livyasan b'Chakah..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot defeat it without Hash-m's help (since Hash-m gave everything power to endure, only He can end it) - "ha'Oso Yagesh Charbo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> When Livyasan is hungry, it spews hot air from its mouth and boils [makes foam] all the water in the depths - "Yati'ach ka'Sir Metzulah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it would not put its mouth in Gan Eden, no creature could stand its smell - "Yam Yasim ka'Merkachah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>When it is thirsty (and drinks), it makes furrows in the sea - "Acharav Ya'ir Nasiv" (the depths are uncovered).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> The depths do not return to normal for 70 years - "Yachshov Tehom l'Seivah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Seivah is never less than 70 years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> In the future, Hash-m will make a feast for Tzadikim from the meat of the Livyasan - "Yichru Alav Chabarim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Kerah' refers to a meal - "va'Yichreh Lahem Kerah Gedolah va'Yochelu va'Yishtu."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Chabarim" refers to Chachamim - "ha'Yosheves ba'Ganim Chaverim Makshivim l'Kolech Hashmi'ini."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The rest of Livyasan will be divided among Chachamim and sold in the markets of Yerushalayim (ha'Rif - it will be given to those who supported Chachamim) - "Yechetzuhu Bein Kena'anim";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Kena'anim" means merchants - "Kena'an b'Yado Moznei Mirmah."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We could also learn from "Sochareha Sarim Kin'aneha Nichbadei Aretz."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> In the future, Hash-m will make a Sukah for Tzadikim from the skin of the Livyasan - "ha'Semalei b'Sukos Oro";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is a Sukah (Rashbam - complete, with walls) for one who merits [did Mitzvos purely to serve Hash-m]. For one with less merit [his Mitzvos were in order to get reward from Hash-m], it is only shade [protects from the day of judgment] - "uv'Tzaltzal Dagim Rosho."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For one with less merit [his Mitzvos were in order to get honor from people], it is a necklace - "va'Anakim l'Gargerosecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>For one with even less merits [his Mitzvos were in order to get reward from people], it is an amulet - "v'Siksherenu l'Na'arosecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Hash-m will spread the rest on the walls of Yerushalayim. Its radiance will shine to the ends of the world - "v'Holchu Goyim l'Orech...".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>NEW THINGS THAT HASH-M WILL MAKE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "V'Samti Kadchod Shimshosayich" [Hash-m will make a new source of light for us] - two angels argue about this, Micha'el and Gavri'el;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say that two Amora'im argue about it, Yehudah and Chizkiyah, the sons of R. Chiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One opinion says that this is Shoham, and the other says that it is Yashfeh (precious stones of the Choshen).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Hash-m decides that it will be 'k'Dein uch'Dein (from "Kadchod", i.e. both will be used).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span>  "U'Sh'arayich l'Avnei Ekdach" teaches that Hash-m will bring gems and pearls 30 Amos by 30 Amos, and carve out a hole 10 Amos by 20 Amos, and erect them at the gates of Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Talmid scoffed. Today we don't find gems the size of a small egg. Will such giant gems be found?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shortly after this, he was on a boat (Ya'avetz - used names of Hash-m,) and saw angels sawing holes in gems, exactly like the dimensions that R. Yochanan taught. He asked what they are for. They answered that Hash-m will put them by the gates of Yerushalayim in the future. He told R. Yochanan that his teaching was correct.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Had you not seen it, you would not believe it?! You mock the words of Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yochanan put his eyes on the Talmid, and he became a mound of bones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "Va'Olech Eschem Komemiyus" - the gates will be 200 Amos tall, twice the Komah (height) of Adam ha'Rishon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, it will be 100 Amos, like the height of the Heichal and its wall - "Benoseinu ch'Zaviyos Mechutavos Tavnis Heichal."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan refers to the gates around the windows in the wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> In the future, Hash-m will make seven canopies for every Tzadik - "u'Vora Hash-m... Anan Yomam (1) v'Ashan (2) v'Nogah (3) Esh (4) Lehavah (5) Laylah Ki Al Kol Kavod Chupah (6). V'Sukah Tihyeh l'Tzel Yom (7)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ki Al Kol Kavod" teaches that Hash-m makes a canopy for everyone according to his honor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is there smoke?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> Anyone who is stingy with Chachamim (does not want them to enjoy his property) in this world, his eyes are filled with smoke in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is there fire?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> Everyone is singed by the canopy of someone greater. (He will regret that he did not attain that level.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Woe, the shame that one will feel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Similarly, "v'Nosata <i>me</i>'Hodecha Alav" (Moshe was told to put <i>some</i> of his glory on Yehoshua), but not all of your glory;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim of that generation said that Moshe's face was radiant like the sun, and Yehoshua's face was radiant like the moon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Woe, what shame (Shita - of Yehoshua, who did not reach Moshe's level; Iyun Yakov - of that generation. Had they merited, Yehoshua would have reached the level of Moshe!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Hash-m made 10 canopies for Adam ha'Rishon - "Odem Pitdah v'Yahalom Tarshish Shoham v'Yashfeh Sapir Nofech u'Varkas v'Zahav";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The lowest of them is gold, for it is last.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "Meleches Tupecha u'Nkavecha Bach" mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> Hash-m told Chiram, king of Tzur 'I foresaw that you would claim to be G-d, therefore I made man full of pores (Rashbam - for excrement).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> Hash-m told Chiram 'I foresaw that you would claim to be G-d, therefore I decreed death on Adam ha'Rishon.'</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE FUTURE YERUSHALAYIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "v'Al Mikra'eha" mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Yerushalayim of this world is not like Yerushalayim of the world to come;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In this world, anyone who wants can come to Yerushalayim. In the world to come, one must be invited.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> In the future, Tzadikim will be called by Hash-m's name - "Kol ha'Nikra vi'Shmi v'Lichvodi Berasiv."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Three are called by Hash-m's name - Tzadikim (like above), Mashi'ach and Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mashi'ach - "v'Zeh Shemo Asher Yikre'o Hash-m Tzidkeinu."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Yerushalayim - "v'Shem ha'Ir mi'Yom Hash-m Shamah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> In the future, (angels) will say 'Kadosh' in front of Tzadikim (Etz Yosef - those who remain alive at the time of revival of the dead), just like they say in front of Hash-m - "ha'Nish'ar... Kodesh Ye'amer Lo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> In the future, Hash-m will lift Yerushalayim three Parsa'os - "v'Ra'amah v'Yoshvah Sachteha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "Sachteha" mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It equals the area Tachteha (underneath it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the area underneath is three Parsa'os?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> An elder (Ya'avetz - Eliyahu) who had seen the first Yerushalayim told me that it was three Parsa'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it will be difficult to ascend to Yerushalayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ka'Av Te'ufenah".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This teaches that clouds are three Parsa'os above the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> Hash-m wanted to put a measure (limit) to Yerushalayim - "Lamod Es Yerushalayim...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The angels protested 'You did not put a measure to cities of Nochrim. Will You put a measure to Yerushalayim, which contains Your name, Your Mikdash and Tzadikim?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Rutz... Perazos Teshev Yerushalayim" (Hash-m retracted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> In the future Hash-m will add to Yerushalayim 169,000 gardens, 210,000 towers, 146,000 buildings, 345,690 small buildings (Ra'avad - 1,000 locked gardens, 1,000 locked towers, 1,000 locked buildings...)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Each of these will be like Tzipori when it was serene.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Tzipori had 180,000 markets selling condiments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "...Shalosh u'Shloshim Pe'amim"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Levi):</span> If the future Yerushalayim will be three times as big as the old, each building will have 30 stories. If it will be 30 times as big, each building will have three stories.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>KINYAN OF A SHIP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Meshichah (pulling) a ship any amount acquires it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He must pull it its own length.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue like the following Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Mesirah (handing over to transfer ownership) is when the buyer grabbed it by the hoof, hair, saddle or sack on it, bit in the mouth, or bell on its neck. He acquires it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Meshichah is when he calls to it and it comes, or he hits it and it runs in front of him. Once it moves a foreleg and hind leg, he acquires;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Achi says, it must move all its legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav holds like the first Tana, Shmuel holds like R. Achi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Rav can even be like R. Achi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Achi said only about an animal that moving a foreleg and hind leg does not suffice, for the animal remains in its place. For a ship, moving any amount moves the entire ship.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Shmuel can even be like the first Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana said only about an animal that moving a foreleg and hind leg suffices, for then it surely will go. For a ship, he must move it its length.</p>
