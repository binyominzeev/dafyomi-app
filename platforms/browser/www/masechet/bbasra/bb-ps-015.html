<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO WROTE THE SEFORIM (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Yirmeyahu wrote Sefer Yirmeyahu, Melachim and Eichah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chizkiyahu and his contemporaries wrote Yeshayah, Mishlei, Shir ha'Shirim and Koheles;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The men of the Great Assembly wrote Yechezkeil, the 12, Daniel and Megilas Esther;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Ezra wrote Sefer Ezra, and the lineage at the beginning of Divrei ha'Yamim until himself (Rashi; Tosfos - until the verse "v'Lo Achim Benei Yehoshafat");</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This supports Rav, who said that Ezra did not leave Bavel until he established his own lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who finished Divrei ha'Yamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Nechemyah did.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yehoshua wrote Sefer Yehoshua and the last eight verses of the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Tana'im argue about whether Moshe or Yehoshua wrote the last eight verses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah or R. Nechemyah):</span> Moshe could not have written "va'Yamas Sham Moshe"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, Moshe wrote until here. Yehoshua wrote the rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Shimon):</span> Had Moshe omitted even one letter of the Torah, it would not say "Lako'ach Es Sefer ha'Torah ha'Zeh"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, until here, Hash-m dictated the Torah and Moshe wrote;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>For these last eight verses, Hash-m dictated and Moshe wrote b'Dema (with tears; Sefas Emes - he wrote the letters without spaces between words).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Similarly, Yirmeyahu dictated his prophecy to Baruch (who wrote it; Rashi - similarly, Baruch did not repeat the verses due to remorse) - "mi'Piv Yikra Elai... va'Ani Kosev."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is the following teaching?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua bar Aba):</span> One person reads the last eight verses (i.e. we do not split the reading among two people).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is not R. Shimon. He holds that Moshe wrote them, so they should be the same as the rest of the Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is even like R. Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He admits that Moshe wrote them differently, therefore they have a special status.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot say that Yehoshua wrote Sefer Yehoshua. It says "va'Yamas Yehoshua"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Elazar finished it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "v'Elazar ben Aharon Mes"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Pinchas finished it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot say that Shmuel wrote Sefer Shmuel. It says "u'Shmuel Mes"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Gad and Nasan finished it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> David and ten other Chachamim wrote Tehilim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should also include Eisan ha'Ezrachi (the author of Tehilim 89)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is Avraham, like it says "Mi He'ir mi'Mizrach".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa counts Moshe and Heiman. Rav said that Heiman is Moshe - "b'Chol Beisi Ne'eman Hu"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moshe is Heiman, but Heiman ha'Ezrachi (the author of Tehilim 88) is someone else.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN DID IYOV LIVE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Moshe wrote the Torah, including the Parshah of Bilam, and Sefer Iyov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This supports Rav Levi bar Lachma.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Levi bar Lachma):</span> Iyov lived in Moshe's day. It says "Mi Yiten Efo", similar to what Moshe said, "uva'Meh Yivada Efo".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he lived in the time of Yitzchak (who said "Mi Efo") or Yakov (who said "Efo Zos Asu") or Yosef (who asked "Eifo Hem Ro'im")?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It also says in Iyov, "...v'Yuchaku". Moshe is called Mechokek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Iyov was in the days of the Meraglim (spies). Iyov lived "b'Eretz Utz", similar to "ha'Yesh Bah Etz."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> 'Utz' and 'Etz' are different!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moshe asked the spies to see if the one (Iyov) whose years are great as a tree, and protects his generation like a tree, is still alive. (This is another answer to b:1.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(A Chacham):</span> Iyov never lived, Sefer Iyov is only a parable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "Ish Hayah" - he did live!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Kivsah Achas... va'Ychayeha" was only a parable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Iyov was only a parable, it would not give his name and his city's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and R. Elazar):</span> Iyov returned with the exiles from Bavel. His Beis Medrash was in Tiverya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Iyov lived from when Yisrael descended to Miztrayim until they left.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, Iyov lived as long as the time from when Yisrael descended to Miztrayim until they left (210 years).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Seven Nevi'im from other nations prophesized: Bilam and his father, Iyov, Elifaz ha'Temani, Bildad ha'Shuchi, Tzufar ha'Na'amasi, and Elihu ben Barach'el ha'Buzi. (This shows that Iyov was not a Yisrael!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> If so, also Elihu ben Barach'el was not a Yisrael. However, it says that he was from the family of Ram (i.e. Avraham! Alternatively, the verse would not give the lineage of a Nochri! Ya'avetz - really, he descended from Buz ben Nachor, Avraham's nephew. This is why he is called ha'Buzi.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> Rather, the Beraisa means that seven Nevi'im prophesized to the other nations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> All the Nevi'im prophesized for all the nations!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The prophecies of these seven were primarily for the other nations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> There was a Chasid of the other nations; he came to the world only to get his reward;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m brought punishments upon him. He blasphemed, so Hash-m doubled his reward in this world to deprive him of his reward in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not he was a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Iyov was in the days of the Shoftim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It says "Hevel Tehavlu" - this is the generation that judged its judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah says, he was in the days of Achashverosh - "v'Lo Nimzta Nashim Yafos.. b'Chol ha'Aretz";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In Achashverosh's day they sought the most beautiful women.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They did also in David's day!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Then, they searched only in Eretz Yisrael, but not in the whole world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Noson says, he was in the days of Malkas (the kingdom of) Sheva - "va'Tipol Sheva."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim say, he was in the days of Kasdim (Babylonians, i.e. Nebuchadnetzar) - "Kasdim... Hiku..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Some say, he was in the days of Yakov, and married Dinah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It says "k'Daber Achas ha'Nevalos", like it says about Dinah "Nevalah Asah b'Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>All the opinions except the last must hold that Iyov was a Yisrael, since they say that he lived after Moshe; (Maharsha - even Yakov's descendants were not considered 'Yisrael' until Matan Torah. Alternatively, it is unreasonable that his descendant would marry her.) (Perhaps this is unreasonable, for Utz (where Iyov lived) is not Mitzrayim, and we cannot say that Iyov was afflicted (at the age of 70) before all Bnei Yisrael descended to Mitzrayim (Yakov had no son above 46 at the time), nor was it after Bnei Yisrael entered Eretz Yisrael (Rashi Bamidbar 26:46 implies that Dinah died before this - <b>PF</b>).)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Moshe requested that Hash-m not give prophecy to Nochrim, and Hash-m agreed - "v'Niflinu... mi'Kol ha'Am."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The generation of Iyov was steeped in lewdness;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Kulchem Chazisem", similar to "v'Nechezeh Bach" (looking at a woman).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it means to see through prophecy, like it says "Chazon Yeshayahu"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (The verse continues) "Hevel Tehbalu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Bi'Mei Shefot ha'Shoftim" refers to a generation that judged its judges;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a judge would rebuke someone for a small transgression, the person would rebuke the judge for a great transgression.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Malkas Sheva was not a woman, rather it is the kingdom of Sheva.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE GREATNESS OF IYOV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>"Va'Ya'an ha'Satan" - the Satan told Hash-m that he did not see anyone in the world as faithful as Avraham;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though Hash-m told Avraham that he will give to him Eretz Yisrael, and Avraham could not find a burial place for Sarah until he paid 400 Shekalim, he did not resent this. (A typical yearly income was 50 Shekalim. Efron demanded coins 100 times bigger than standard Shekalim (Rashi Bereishis 23:16).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Hash-m told the Satan to consider Iyov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The verse praises Iyov more than Avraham!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Avraham it says "Yerei Elokim." Regarding Iyov it says "Ish Tam v'Yashar Yerei Elokim v'Sar me'Ra";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "v'Sar me'Ra"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba bar Shmuel):</span> He was easygoing with his money;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Normally, if one owes half a Perutah (the smallest coin is a Perutah), he buys something for a Perutah and shares it with the one he owes. Iyov would give the full Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "The Satan answered... 'Ma'ase Yadav Berachta."' What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> Anyone who received a Perutah from Iyov was blessed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "u'Miknehu Paratz ba'Aretz"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Iyov's flock overstepped nature;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Normally, wolves kill goats; Iyov's flock killed wolves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Satan thought that if Iyov's prosperity ceased, he would blaspheme. Hash-m authorized the Satan to do as he wishes to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "The cattle were plowing and the donkeys were grazing Al Yedeihem." What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> (The fodder grew instantly.) Hash-m gave Iyov a taste of the world to come.</p>
