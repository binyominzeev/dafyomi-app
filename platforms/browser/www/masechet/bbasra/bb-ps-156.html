<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>GIFTS OF ADOLESCENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> An adolescent (an adult less than 18 (or 20)) can give a gift of land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> We invalidate his sale, even though he received money. All the more so his gift is invalid, he does not get anything for it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Ameimar):</span> If he sold something worth five for six, do you validate the sale, because he got more than its value?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> You must say that Chachamim know that children love money. If we allow them to sell, buyers will entice them to sell all their property;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> One does not give a gift unless the recipient did something nice for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim enable adolescents to give gifts, so people will do nice things for them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE REQUISITE AGES FOR VARIOUS MATTERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> We check boys above 13 (and girls above 12) for hairs regarding Kidushin, divorce, Chalitzah, and Mi'un;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One cannot sell his father's property until he is 20.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we checked him when he was Mekadesh, why must we check him when he divorces?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must check an adolescent who did Yibum and then wants to divorce her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a nine-year old did Yibum, he acquired her. He cannot divorce her until he is an adult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Nachman taught that we check for Chalitzah. This is unlike R. Yosi,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi says, because it says 'Ish' in the Parshah of Chalitzah, the Yavam must be an adult. Since it does not say 'Ishah', the Yevamah can be a minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Nachman equates the laws of the Yavam and Yevamah. Just like he must be an adult, also she must be.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Nachman taught that we check for Mi'un. This is unlike R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, a girl may do Mi'un until the area is black (she has so many hairs that one reaches to the next).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Nachman forbids Mi'un once she has two hairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Nachman taught that he cannot sell his father's property until 20, to discredit the opinion that says (in his name) 18.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Halachah is, during the (18th or 20th) year the sale is void;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Halachah follows (the answer to the question of) Gidal bar Menasiyah (if an adolescent understands business well, he can sell his father's property);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Halachah follows Mar Zutra (an adolescent can testify about Metaltelim, but not about land);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Halachah follows Ameimar (any adolescent can give a gift of land);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The Halachah follows Rav Nachman regarding checking for Kidushin, divorce, Chalitzah, and Mi'un, and selling the father's property.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DOES A SHECHIV MERA NEED A <i>KINYAN</i> TO BEQUEATH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> The ways to give property are the same for sick and healthy people: property with Acharayus is acquired through money, a document or Chazakah. Property without Acharayus is only acquired through Meshichah;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">156b----------------------------------------156b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> A case occurred in which the mother of Benei Rochel was sick. She said 'give my clasp to my daughter. It is worth 1200 Zuz.' The mother died, and Chachamim fulfilled her words!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> She should bury her sons! (They were sinners. Chachamim fulfilled her words only in order to fine her sons, so they would not inherit it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> A case occurred in which a man wanted to give a gift of much Metaltelim. People told him that the only way is to give it Agav land (even though he was dying);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He bought a Beis Sela (this will be explained) of land, and said 'the north part is to Ploni, and with it 100 flock animals and 100 barrels. The south part is to Almoni, and with it 100 flock animals and 100 barrels.' Chachamim approved the sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No, he was healthy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> She should bury her sons!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he curse them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They allowed thorns to grow in a vineyard. R. Elazar forbids this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> One who lets thorns grow in a vineyard, this is Kilayim. The thorns and nearby vines are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, only something that people normally grow is Kilayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> R. Elazar forbids keeping thorns (everywhere) because in Araviya people grow thorns for their camels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> We may make a Kinyan from a Shechiv Mera, even on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not due to concern for R. Elazar's opinion that a Kinyan is needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, it is lest he think that it is needed, and (if we do not do it) panic, which will worsen his condition.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a Shechiv Mera commands on Shabbos, his words take effect (without a Kinyan) because we may not write a document, but not if he commands on a weekday;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Yehoshua says, his words take effect on Shabbos (even though we could not write them), and all the more so on a weekday!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Similarly, R. Eliezer says, we may be Mezakeh for (acquire on behalf of) a minor, but not for an adult (he could acquire for himself);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Yehoshua says, we may be Mezakeh for a minor, and all the more so for an adult (who could acquire for himself)!</p>
