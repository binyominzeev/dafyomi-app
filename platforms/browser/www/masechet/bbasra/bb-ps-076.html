<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>KINYAN OF A SHIP (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav and Shmuel argue like the following Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A ship is acquired through Meshichah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Noson says, a ship or Osiyos (the contents of a document) is acquired through Meshichah or a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Noson teach about acquiring Osiyos? The first Tana did not mention this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated. It means as follows. A ship is acquired through Meshichah, and Osiyos are acquired through Mesirah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Noson says, a ship or Osiyos is acquired through Meshichah or a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why does a document acquire a ship? A ship is Metaltelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it means that a ship is acquired through Meshichah, and Osiyos are acquired through Mesirah. R. Noson says, a ship is acquired through Meshichah, and Osiyos are acquired through a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also the first Tana says that a ship is acquired through Meshichah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about how far it must be pulled, like Rav and Shmuel argue. (Rashbam - the latter Tana always comes to add, i.e. the entire ship must be pulled; Tosfos - just like R. Noson requires a greater Kinyan for Osiyos, also for a ship.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, both hold like Rav, or like Shmuel. They argue only about Osiyos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Noson says 'I agree with you about a ship, but I say that Osiyos are acquired only with a document.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue like Rebbi and Chachamim argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - Rebbi):</span> Osiyos are acquired through Mesirah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim say, he must write another document and do Mesirah. Doing only one is not enough.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana who argues with R. Noson cannot be Rebbi, for Rebbi holds that also Mesirah acquires a ship!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - Rebbi):</span> A ship is acquired through Mesirah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim say, it is not acquired until he does Meshichah or rents the place where it is standing.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">76b----------------------------------------76b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi said that a ship is acquired through Mesirah, i.e. in a Reshus ha'Rabim. In a Simta (areas next to the Reshus ha'Rabim), Meshichah acquires.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHERE THE VARIOUS <i>KINYANIM</i> WORK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot establish Beraisa #2 to be in a Reshus ha'Rabim, for Chachamim say that it is not acquired until he does Meshichah or rents the place it is standing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From whom can one rent a Reshus ha'Rabim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, Meshichah does not acquire in a Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> Mesirah acquires in a Reshus ha'Rabim, or in a Chatzer that does not belong to both of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Meshichah acquires in a Simta or in their joint Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Hagbahah (lifting the item) acquires everywhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim mean, it is not acquired until he does Meshichah from the Reshus ha'Rabim to a Simta. If it is in the owner's premises, he must rent the place it is standing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Abaye and Rava hold like Rebbi, unlike Chachamim (who say that Mesirah does not acquire in a Reshus ha'Rabim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> Chachamim agree that Mesirah acquires if the seller said 'go make Chazakah and acquire';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue when he said 'go be Moshech and acquire';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim say that he is insistent that the buyer do Meshichah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rebbi says, he merely suggests that he may acquire through Meshichah if he wants. He may also acquire through Mesirah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SALE OF <i>OSIYOS</i> (A DOCUMENT)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If Reuven sold Osiyos to Shimon, he must write (in the document to transfer ownership) 'acquire it and all liens that it creates.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If he did not write this, for what does he sell the document? To cork up a bottle?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> Yes!</p>
