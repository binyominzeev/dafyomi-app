<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ARGUMENT OF REBBI AND R. SHIMON BEN GAMLIEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If Reuven says that he has a document and a Chazakah for his land, he must produce the document;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he brings witnesses of Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Dimi):</span> They argue about whether or not Osiyos are acquired through Mesirah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says that Osiyos are not acquired through Mesirah (until he also makes Chazakah in the land);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says that Osiyos are acquired through Mesirah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> This argues with Rabah (he says that R. Shimon ben Gamliel holds that Osiyos are acquired through Mesirah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> Yes, I argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> The only way to explain the Mishnah is like Rabah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The case is, one of the witnesses was found to be a relative or invalid witness. They argue as R. Meir and R. Elazar argue;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi holds like R. Elazar, who says that Edei Mesirah Karsei (a document is empowered by the witnesses who saw it given. Therefore, as long as valid witnesses saw the document given, it is valid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel holds like R. Meir, who says that Edei Chasimah Karsei (a document is empowered by the witnesses who signed it. Therefore, the document is invalid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Aba taught that R. Elazar admits that a document signed by invalid witnesses is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Avina):</span> All agree that if the document says 'we (Beis Din) investigated the testimony, and we found that it is invalid', the document is invalid, as R. Aba taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about a document without signatures.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi holds like R. Elazar, that Edei Mesirah Karsei (therefore, it is valid without signatures);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel holds like R. Meir, who says that Edei Chasimah Karsei (therefore, it is invalid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Avina):</span> They argue about whether or not the lender must validate a document if the borrower admits that he authorized it (but claims that he paid it):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi says, he need not validate it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he must validate it. (If not, the borrower is believed to say that he paid, Migo (since) he could claim that it was forged.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They hold just the contrary!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Reuven (the lender) and Shimon (the borrower) were fighting over the document: Reuven says 'I dropped it, and you found it.' Shimon says 'no, I paid you.' Reuven must validate it to collect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he collects half.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rebbi argue with the following Mishnah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Levi and Yehudah were holding a garment, and each claims 'I found it', each swears that he does not own less than half, and they divide it. (Here also, perhaps Shimon dropped it. Why can Reuven collect the full amount if he validates it?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If the document was validated, all agree that he collects half;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They argue in a case that when it was not validated. Rebbi says, even though Shimon admits that it he authorized it, Reuven must validate it (to collect half);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he need not validate it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We must switch the opinions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We need not switch the opinions. They argue about whether one must justify all his claims:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi says that he must. He must validate the document <i>and</i> bring witnesses of Chazakah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says that one need not justify all his claims. It suffices to bring witnesses of Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rav Yitzchak bar Yosef claimed that R. Aba owed him money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> I paid you in front of Ploni and Almoni.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak Nafcha (who was judging the case):</span> Let Ploni and Almoni come testify!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> Am I not believed without them? If one borrowed money in front of witnesses (and no document was written), he need not pay back in front of witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak Nafcha:</span> You yourself taught in Rav's name that if one says 'I paid you in front of Ploni and Almoni', they must testify for him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> Rav said that the Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel. Even Rebbi said to validate the document only in order to clarify his claim (but if he cannot, he does not lose).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">170b----------------------------------------170b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak Nafcha:</span> Also I said only that they should testify in order to clarify your claim!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DO WE WRITE A NEW DOCUMENT AFTER PARTIAL PAYMENT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If Reuven paid part of his debt to Shimon, he exchanges (tears the document and writes a new document for the remainder);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, Shimon gives Reuven a receipt for what he paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> If so, Reuven must guard his receipt, lest mice eat it (and Shimon will force him pay the entire debt)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> That is better than making Shimon lose his lien (from the time of the original document).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Yehudah, nor R. Yosi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, Beis Din tears the old document, and write a new document from the original date.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Had Rav heard the following Beraisa, he would have retracted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> <i>Witnesses</i> tear the old document, and write a new document from the original date.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> Rav heard it, but he did not retract. (He is a Tana. He may argue with a Beraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Din has authority to dispossess money as they see fit (to write a predated document);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The witnesses did what they were told (to write a document from the original date). They have no authority to do so again!</p>
