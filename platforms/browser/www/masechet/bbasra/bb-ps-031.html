<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS A GOOD CLAIM WITH A CHAZAKAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Levi and Yehudah both claimed that they a certain field was of their fathers. Levi brought witnesses that it was his father's, and Yehudah brought witnesses that he used the field for the years of Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> Certainly, Yehudah is telling the truth. Why should he lie and say that it belonged to his father? If he wanted to lie, he could make a better claim, that he bought it from Levi, and used it for the years of Chazakah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> The principle 'why should he lie' does not override witnesses (who say that it belonged to Levi's fathers)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah later retracted:</span> Yes, it belonged to your fathers. I bought it from you. I said that it was my fathers', for (since I made a Chazakah,) I am confident of keeping it like one who inherited his fathers' land</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can one claim, and then change his claim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> One can/</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chachamim of Neharde'a):</span> One cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>In two cases, Ula admits that he cannot change his claim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He initially said 'it belonged to my fathers, and not to your fathers.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He did not make a claim in Beis Din, and after he left Beis Din, he returns and claims.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this not allowed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We suspect that others instructed him how he should claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>In two cases, Chachamim of Neharde'a admit that he can change his claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He later says 'it belonged to my fathers, who bought it from your fathers.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They were discussing the case outside of Beis Din, and he did not make any claim, and when he came to Beis Din, he made a claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this allowed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is normal that one reveals his claims only in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> I am from Neharde'a, yet I hold that one may change his claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Halachah is, one may change his claim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Levi and Yehudah both claimed that they inherited a field from their fathers. Levi brought witnesses that it was his father's and that he has used the field for the years of Chazakah, and Yehudah brought witnesses that he used the field for the years of Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The contradictory testimonies about the Chazakah cancel each other. We are left with testimony that it belonged to Levi's fathers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> The testimonies contradict each other. We cannot rely on either testimony!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The contradiction is only regarding Chazakah, but not regarding to whose fathers it belonged.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rava and Rav Nachman argue as Rav Huna and Rav Chisda.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If two sets of witnesses contradict each other, either set may testify by itself in a different case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Since we are in doubt which set lied, we do not accept the testimony of either set.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Indeed, Rav Chisda must hold like Rava;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, Rav Huna could hold like Rav Nachman, or even like Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Huna said that we accept the testimony of one set of witnesses in subsequent cases. He could admit that we do not accept their testimony in the case in which they were contradicted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>After Rav Nachman ruled that the field belongs to Levi, Yehudah brought witnesses that it was his father's.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> We established Levi to be the owner of the field. We remove him from it (and whoever is stronger will prevail). We are not concerned for the disgrace to Beis Din (that we contradict our previous ruling).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If two witnesses say that Leah's husband died, and two say that he did not die; or two witnesses say that she was divorced, and two say that she was not divorced, she may not remarry. If she remarried, we do not force her husband to divorce her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Menachem b'Rebbi Yosi says, he must divorce her. This is only if she remarried after the witnesses who said that she is still married;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she remarried before witnesses said that she is still married, she may remain married. (This shows that we are concerned for disgrace to Beis Din!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rav Nachman):</span> I was about to rule like I taught. Now that you refuted me, I will abstain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Nachman reversed the decision of Beis Din, and was not concerned for the disgrace to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An observer thought he erred, but this is not true. Rather, he found that Tana'im argue about whether or not we are concerned for disgrace to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> We do not establish a man to be a Kohen based on one witness;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Elazar says, this is only if this is challenged; if no one argues, we establish a man to be a Kohen based on one witness;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, we establish a man to be a Kohen based on one witness.</p>
