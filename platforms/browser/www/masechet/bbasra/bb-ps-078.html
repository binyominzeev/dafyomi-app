<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA BASRA 78 (14 Nisan) - dedicated by Mr. D. Kornfeld l'Iluy Nishmas his grandmother, Chayah bas Aryeh Leib Shpira (nee Sole), on the day of her Yahrzeit. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO GROSSLY OVERPAID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the price is not a proof, the sale should be invalid! (He overcharged much more than a sixth.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim holds that overcharging does not invalidate a sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If one sells a Sefer Torah, animal or pearl, the buyer cannot claim Ona'ah (that he was overcharged);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim say, only the exceptions we listed (Bava Metzia 56a - slaves, documents, land and Hekdesh) are not subject to Ona'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, Chachamim say that the price is not a proof, i.e. the  sale is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Chachamim say that Ona'ah and voiding of the sale apply to a case in which one could err;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If clearly he knew that the price is too high, he gave the extra money for a gift.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ARE KELIM SOLD WITH A DONKEY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sells a donkey, he does not include its Kelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Nachum ha'Midi says, he includes its Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, sometimes they are included, and sometimes not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the donkey was in front of him and the Kelim were on it, and the buyer said 'sell to me this donkey of yours', they are included;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the buyer asked 'is this your donkey (so I can buy it)?'  they are not included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Ula):</span> They argue about bags (for loads) and a saddle for women;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana holds that donkeys are normally for men to ride on, so these are not included;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Nachum ha'Midi holds that donkeys are (also) for carrying loads (and women), so they are included;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>All agree that Kelim needed for riding (e.g. (men's) saddles) are included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one said 'I sell to you a donkey and its Kelim', Kelim needed for riding are included, but not bags or women's saddles;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'it and everything on it', all these are included.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he not said 'I sell to you a donkey and its Kelim', he would not acquire Kelim needed for riding!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, even without saying this, he acquires them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Chidush is that even when he says this, bags and women's saddles are not included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do they argue when the Kelim are on the donkey, but when they are not, Nachum ha'Midi admits that they are not included?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, do they argue when the Kelim are not on the donkey, but when they are on it, Chachamim (the first Tana) admits that they are included?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> If he said 'it and everything on it', all these are included.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they argue when the Kelim are on the donkey, the Beraisa is Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if they argue when the Kelim are not on it, but when they are on it, all agree that they are included, the Beraisa is not like anyone! (Even though the bags are on it, they are included only if he said 'it and everything on it'!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, they argue when the Kelim are not on it. The Beraisa is Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It discusses when (the bags are not on it, and) he said 'it and everything fitting to be on it.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Sometimes they are included, and sometimes not...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yehudah discusses the same case as the first Tana, i.e. the Kelim are on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No R. Yehudah teaches a new case.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">78b----------------------------------------78b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina - the previous Mishnah):</span> If one sells a wagon, he did not sell the mules. If he sold the mules, he did not sell the wagon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Tachlifa bar Ma'arava - Beraisa):</span> If one sells a wagon, he sells the mules.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Avahu:</span> Our Mishnah says that he did not sell the mules!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Tachlifa:</span> I will no longer recite this Beraisa (it is mistaken).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Avahu:</span> It is not mistaken. The case is, the mules are attached to the wagon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> In the Beraisa, the mules are attached, but in the (previous) Mishnah, they are not attached. Presumably, also in our Mishnah they are not on it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (the first Mishnah of our Perek):</span> He did not sell the slaves or Antiki;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Antiki is the merchandise in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the first Mishnah, they are on it. Presumably, the same applies in our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Each Mishnah is independent. They need not be like each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The following Tana'im all say that when one sells something, he includes everything used with it: R. Eliezer, R. Shimon ben Gamliel, R. Meir, R. Noson, Sumchus, and Nachum ha'Midi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If one sells an olivepress, the beam is included.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If one sells a city, the Santar is included.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one sells a vineyard, everything needed for it is included.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Noson and Sumchus say that a small boat is included with a ship (73a).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Nachum ha'Midi says so in our Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Sometimes, they are included...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference whether he says 'sell to me this donkey of yours' or 'is this your donkey?'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> When he says 'this donkey of yours', he already knew that he owns it. 'This' comes to include the Kelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he says 'is this your donkey?', he did not know whether or not he owns it. He just asks if it is his to sell.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS AN ANIMAL'S CHILD INCLUDED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sells a donkey, he included the Si'ach (baby donkey). If one sells a cow, the calf is not included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one sells a wasteheap, the manure is included. If one sells a pit, the water is included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one sells a hive, the bees are included. If one sells a dovecote, the doves are included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'I sell it and its son', a calf should be included with the cow!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he did not say 'it and its son', why is the Si'ach included?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> He sold 'a nursing donkey (or cow)';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding a cow, we can say that he mentioned that it is nursing, for the milk is valuable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding a donkey, we must say that he mentioned that it is nursing to include the Si'ach.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE MOST IMPORTANT CALCULATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a baby donkey called a Si'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is because it follows a gentle Sichah (voice).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> What is the meaning of "Al Ken Yomeru ha'Moshelim..."?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shmuel):</span> "Ha'Moshelim" are people who Moshel (rule over) their evil inclinations;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Bo'u Cheshbon" - come, make the most important calculation, i.e. what one loses to do a Mitzvah, compared to the reward he will receive, and what one gains by a transgression, compared to what he will lose from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Tibaneh v'Sikonen" - if you do so, you will be built in this world and prepared for the world to come;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Ir Sichon" - if one acts like an Ayar (Si'ach), and follows the voice of his evil inclination and heresy, "Esh Yotz'ah mi'Cheshbon";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Fire from those who calculate will consume those who do not calculate.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Lehavah mi'Kiryas Sichon" - from the city of Tzadikim, who are called Sichin (trees).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"Achlah Ar..." refers to one who follows his evil inclination, like an Ayar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>"Ba'alei Bamos..." are haughty people;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Anyone who has haughtiness falls to Gehinom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>"Va'Niram" - a Rasha says 'Ein Ram' (he denies the Exalted, i.e. Hash-m) and "Ovad Cheshbon" (people are not judged).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>"Ad Divon" - Hash-m says, 'wait until judgment will come!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>"Va'Nashim Ad Nofach" - a fire will come that need not be fanned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>"Ad Meideva" - until their Neshamos will be distraught.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Some explain, until Hash-m punishes them like d'Boi (He wants).</p>
