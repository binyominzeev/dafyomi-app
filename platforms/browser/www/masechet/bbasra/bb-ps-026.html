<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>When people of Bar Meryon's house combed flax, the chaff would fly off and damage people; people complained.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> R. Yosi admits regarding Giri Dilei, but that is when he set the damager in motion. Here, the wind takes it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> Regarding Shabbos, one is liable for winnowing, even though the wind helps him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mereimar):</span> Indeed, here also, it is due to his Ko'ach (impetus, so he must distance his flax).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Ravina):</span> Why is this different than when the wind carries a spark from a hammer? There, the smith is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The smith is happy that the spark leave his shop (so it will not cause a fire in the shop). The owners of the flax do not need the chaff to fly away.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Vines have the same law as trees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If there is a fence in between, each may plant up to the fence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If the roots of Reuven's tree are in Shimon's field, Shimon may cut them up to three Tefachim deep, so they will not impede his plow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon digs a pit, he may cut whatever roots he encounters. The (cut) roots are his.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> He must distance four Amos, because this amount is needed to tend to a vineyard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Shmuel):</span> This is only in Eretz Yisrael. In Bavel, two Amos are enough.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Reuven must distance his tree two Amos from Shimon's field;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> The Mishnah requires him to distance four Amos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses Eretz Yisrael, and the Beraisa discusses Bavel.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah discusses Eretz Yisrael, and the Beraisa discusses Bavel. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rava bar Rav Chanan had date trees bordering on Rav Yosef's vineyard. Birds came to the trees and descended to the vines, and damaged them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Cut your trees!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I kept the proper distance!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> A greater distance is required for vines.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> Vines have the same law as trees.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The same distance is required between trees and trees or between vines and vines. A greater distance is required between trees and vines.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I will not cut them, for Rav forbids cutting a tree that produces a Kav of dates;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Chanina said that his son died only because his son cut a fig tree prematurely.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If you want to cut, I permit you!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rav Papa had date trees bordering on Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua's property. He saw Rav Huna digging and cutting the roots; he asked why he was doing this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> The Mishnah says, if Reuven's roots in Shimon's field, he may cut them up to three Tefachim deep, so they will not impede his plow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> You are cutting deeper than three Tefachim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> I am digging a pit. The Mishnah says 'if he digs a pit, he may cut whatever roots he encounters, and the roots are his.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rav Papa tried bringing many proofs. Only the following dissuaded Rav Huna.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may not ruin a path that the public has been using.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna (after Rav Papa left):</span> I should have answered that the Chazakah is only within 16 Amos (the tree is fed from those roots), but past that I may cut!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon digs a pit, he may cut whatever roots he encounters. The roots are his.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Yakov Hadayva):</span> Who gets the roots?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda - Mishnah):</span> If Levi's roots enter Hekdesh's field, it is forbidden (mid'Rabanan) to benefit from them. If one benefited, he did not transgress Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we say that the roots belong to the tree's owner, we understand why there is no Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if they belong to the owner of the field, there should be Me'ilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If roots of a Hekdesh tree enter Levi's field, one may not benefit from them. If one benefited, he did not transgress Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the roots belong to the tree's owner, there should be Me'ilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah discusses what grew after the tree was made Hekdash. the Tana holds that Me'ilah does not apply to what grows from Hekdesh. (Therefore, we cannot settle Yakov's question from the Mishnah of Me'ilah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> The first clause discusses roots within 16 Amos, these belong to the tree's owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The second clause discusses roots beyond 16 Amos, they belong to the owner of the field.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE AREA FROM WHICH TREES NURTURE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If Reuven's tree is within 16 Amos of Shimon's property, he is a thief (it nurtures from Shimon's property), and he does not bring Bikurim from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Ula's source?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Mishnah):</span> (Normally, we add on to Shemitah and prohibit some labors in the previous year.) If ten saplings are spread over a Beis Se'ah (a field in which one seeds a Se'ah), one may plow the entire Beis Se'ah for the sake of the trees until Rosh Hashanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Beis Se'ah is 2500 (square) Amos, i.e. 250 Amos for each tree;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to Ula, each tree nurtures from 16 Amos in each direction, i.e. a square of 32 by 32 Amos, its area is 1024 (square) Amos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If three (adult) trees in a Beis Se'ah are owned by three people, we may plow the entire Beis Se'ah for the sake of the trees (until Shavu'os).</p>
