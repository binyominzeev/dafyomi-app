<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CHAZAKAH FOR DAMAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Yosef had small date trees. Bloodletters sat under them. Ravens came to eat the blood of their Kelim, and perched on the trees, and damaged the dates.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> The bloodletters must leave!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> It is only Grama!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Rav Tuvi taught that Grama of damage is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> They are Muchzak to sit there!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Rav Nachman taught that there is no Chazakah for something that damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Rav Mari taught that that refers to smoke, and Rav Zevid taught that it refers to a Beis ha'Kisei (a privy. It does not apply to other things!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I am very sensitive. The ravens bother me like smoke and a Beis ha'Kisei.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PREVENTING DAMAGE OF BIRDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One must distance a dovecote 50 Amos from a city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may not make a dovecote in his property unless he owns 50 Amos around it in every direction;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, he must own (the area in which one seeds) four Korim. This is as far as birds fly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one bought a dovecote, even if it is very close to neighbors, he is Muchzak (and may keep it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Fifty Amos is not enough!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> We may not set traps for doves within four Mil (a Mil is about a kilometer) of a settled area.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> They can fly further, but they eat their fill within 50 Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They can fly more than four Mil!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> In a settled area, one may not set traps within 100 Mil!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> That is when vineyards are in between (it flies from vineyard to vineyard).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> That is when other dovecotes are in between.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, one may not spread traps due to the other dovecotes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answers:</span> The trapper owns the other dovecotes, or a Nochri owns them, or they are Hefker.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CHAZAKAH OF THINGS THAT MAY DAMAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah... (If one bought a dovecote, even if it is very close to neighbors, he is Muchzak).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This teaches that we suggest claims on behalf of buyers and heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Mishnah explicitly teaches that we claim on behalf of heirs!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An heir need not explain how the one who bequeathed to him received the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Papa needed to teach about buyers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Mishnah also explicitly teaches that we claim on behalf of buyers!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one bought a Chatzer with ledges sticking out (over the Reshus ha'Rabim) he is Muchzak (that he is entitled to them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must teach both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had we taught only that case, one might have thought there we argue for a buyer, for perhaps the area under them was really part of the Chatzer, or the public allowed the previous owner to build them, but we would not argue for one who buys a dovecote.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we only taught about a dovecote, one might have thought that the previous owner appeased the neighbor, or the neighbor allowed him;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But we would not assume that one appeased or obtained pardon from the public!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is Muchzak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Nachman taught that there is no Chazakah for damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Mari):</span> Rav Nachman refers to damage of smoke.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Zvid):</span> He refers to a Beis ha'Kisei.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CHICKS THAT ARE FOUND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A chick found within 50 Amos of Reuven's dovecote belongs to Reuven;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is more than 50 Amos away, the finder keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If it is found between two dovecotes, it belongs to the owner of the closer one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is exactly in the middle, they divide it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Chanina):</span> When in doubt about where something came from, we assume that it came from the majority, even if the minority is closer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though the Torah says that we follow the majority, and that we attribute to the closest source, the majority is stronger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> "Ha'Ir ha'Kerovah" - we attribute (an unknown murderer) to the closest city, even though other cities have more people!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Torah selects the closest city only when the populations are equal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we follow the majority, we should assume that the murderer came from the rest of the world (not from the closest city)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the area is surrounded by mountains (so we do not suspect that the murderer came from further away).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A chick found within 50 Amos of Reuven's dovecote belongs to Reuven;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though there are dovecotes with more birds, we assume that it came from Reuven's!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, no dovecote in the area has more birds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Mishnah):</span> If it is more than 50 Amos away, the finder keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If no dovecote in the area has more birds, surely it came from Reuven's!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The chick cannot fly, it only walks.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ukva bar Chama):</span> A chick does not walk more than 50 Amos. (If it is not within 50 of any dovecote, we must say that it flew. We assume that it came from elsewhere in the world.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If one leg is within 50 Amos and the other is outside, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yirmeyah was expelled from the Beis Medrash for this (Rashi - for asking too many questions; Tosfos - for not accepting that it cannot walk more than 50 Amos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If it is found between two dovecotes, it belongs to the owner of the closer one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is even if one has more chicks than the other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, both have the same amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should assume that it came from elsewhere in the world (since it cannot walk more than 50)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it was found on a path between vineyards, so it can walk more than 50;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It could not have come from another dovecote, since a chick will never walk out of sight of its nest (and these are the only two dovecotes in sight).</p>
