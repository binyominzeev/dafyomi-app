<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA BASRA 2-8 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to Rav Weiner -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda imposed a tax on Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> You transgressed Torah, the Nevi'im and Kesuvim (the Writings)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Torah - "Af Chovev Amim Kol Kedoshav b'Yadecha" - Moshe requested that even when You endear nations and allow them to rule over Yisrael, the Kedoshim of Yisrael should be in Your hand (to protect them);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "V'Hem Tuku l'Raglecha" refers to Chachamim, who go from city to city and from province to province to learn Torah</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"Yisa Midabrosecha" - in order to engage in Hash-m's teachings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Nevi'im - "Gam Ki Yisnu va'Goyim Atah Akabetzem";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> (The word Yisnu) in this verse is Arame'ic (it means 'they will learn'). Hash-m promises that if all of Yisrael will learn (while in exile), He will gather them speedily.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"Va'Yachelu Me'at mi'Masa Melech Sarim" - if only some learn, the king will not conscript them for his work.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Kesuvim - "Minda Velo va'Halach (various taxes) La Shalit Lemirma Aleihom (the king will not be able to impose on them)";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Minda" is the king's tax. "Velo" is the head tax. "Halach" is a tithe of yearly animals and Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Papa imposed a tax on city residents, including orphans, to dig a new well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> Perhaps they will not find water (and the money was wasted. Others can pardon this, but orphans cannot!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> I will collect the money. If we don't find water, I will return their money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Everyone must contribute towards doors for the walls, even orphans, but not Chachamim, for they do not need protection.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Everyone must contribute towards digging wells for water, even Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is only if they hire others to dig. If they themselves dig, Chachamim are exempt (it is below their dignity).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>In famine years, Rebbi opened his storehouse (of food) to anyone who learned written Torah, Mishnah, Gemara, Halachah or Agadah, but not to an ignoramus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yonason ben Amram forced his way in and requested food. He said that he had not learned even written Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> If so, why should I support you?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yonason:</span> Please support me, just like Hash-m feeds dogs and ravens.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rebbi gave to him. Later, he regretted that he gave his food to an ignoramus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon (Rebbi's son):</span> Perhaps it was your Talmid R. Yonason, who never wants to benefit from his Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Rebbi investigated, and found that this was so. He announced that all may take food (so no one would need to benefit from Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This is like Rebbi said (elsewhere), that all punishments come to the world due to ignoramuses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Kaiser imposed a tax on the city of Tiverya in order to buy a crown. The ignoramuses asked Rebbi that Chachamim should also pay, and they threatened to leave otherwise. Rebbi refused, and half of them left.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Kaiser pardoned the city from half the original demand. The remaining ignoramuses asked that Chachamim should also pay, and threatened to leave. Rebbi refused, and they all left, except for one launderer. The kings' officers imposed the entire tax on him. He left, and the Kaiser totally pardoned the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> This teaches that punishments come only due to ignoramuses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who has lived in the city 12 months is considered a resident...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If a caravan of donkey-drivers or camel-drivers lodged in a city (that became an Ir ha'Nidachas, i.e. it must be destroyed because most of the people served idolatry) and were enticed to serve idolatry, they are stoned, and their heirs inherit their money (like individuals who served idolatry);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they were in the city for 30 days (and were enticed with it), they are killed by the sword and their property is destroyed (like residents of the city).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Regarding Ir ha'Nidachas, it says "Yoshevei (those who stay in) ha'Ir." After 30 days, one is considered to be staying there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For other matters, one is not considered to be (a resident) of the city until 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one vows not to benefit from people of a city, he is forbidden to benefit from people that have lived there for 12 months;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he vows not to benefit from Yoshevei ha'Ir, he is forbidden to benefit from people who have lived there for 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that for other matters, one is not considered to be (a resident) of the city until 12 months?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> After (living in a city for) 30 days, one must contribute to the Tamchuy (food for the poor of the city). After three months, he must give (money) to the Kupah (for the poor). After six months, he must contribute for their clothes. After nine months, he must contribute for their burial. After 12 months, he must contribute for planks (used to support the wall).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Asi):</span> Indeed, the Mishnah teaches that after 12 months he is a resident regarding planks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Everyone must contribute for planks, even orphans, but not Chachamim, for they do not need protection.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Everyone must contribute for the following, even orphans, but not Chachamim (they do not need protection): the wall, a guard who rides around the wall, and someone to watch the weapons.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The general rule is, orphans must contribute to anything they benefit from.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Rabah imposed Tzedakah on the orphans of Bar Meryon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah taught that we do not impose Tzedakah on orphans, even to redeem captives!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> I did so for their prestige.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REDEEMING CAPTIVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The mother of Shevor Malka (the Persian king) sent money to Rav Yosef to use for a 'big Mitzvah.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> What is a big Mitzvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah taught that we do not impose Tzedakah on orphans, even to redeem captives. This implies that redeeming captives is a big Mitzvah.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is the source that redeeming captives is a big Mitzvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Mari):</span> "Whoever deserves to die (on his bed) will die (that way. Whoever deserves to die) by the sword (will die) by the sword, by hunger through hunger, la'Shevi (for captivity) la'Shevi";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The latter punishments in the verse are harsher than the earlier ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We know that the sword is harsher than death from a verse, or from reasoning:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Reasoning - the body is not disgraced through (normal) death, but it is disgraced by the sword.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>A verse - "dear to Hash-m is ha'Mavsah (normal death) of his Chasidim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We know that the hunger is harsher than the sword from a verse, or from reasoning:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Reasoning - one who starves suffers prolonged pain.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>A verse - "those killed by the sword were better than those who died from hunger."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Captivity is the worst, for it includes all of them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>COLLECTORS OF TZEDAKAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (At least) two people must be present when collecting (money) for the Kupah. Three are needed to distribute it to the poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Two are needed to collect, for two are needed to impose any authority over the congregation;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Three are needed to distribute, for this is like judgment of monetary cases, which requires a Beis Din (to say that a certain person is entitled to collect).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Three must be present when collecting (food) for the Tamchuy, and three are needed to distribute it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Because it is distributed (the same day, just) like it is collected, they should be ready to distribute it immediately (without having to find another person).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Tamchuy is (collected) each day, and the Kupah every Erev Shabbos (Rambam; Aruch ha'Shulchan - both are collected every day. This is when they are <i>distributed.</i>)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tamchuy is for all poor people. The Kupah is only for poor people of that city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>People of a city may change the (distribution of the) Tamchuy to be like the Kupah, or vice-versa, or to use the money for anything they want.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>People of the city may fix the measures, prices and wages as they see fit, and to enforce this with fines.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said that two are needed to impose any authority over the congregation. What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> (We learn from collection for the Mishkan -) "v'Hem (plural) Yikchu Es ha'Zahav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The verse teaches that one person may not collect, but one is believed. This supports R. Chanina.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Rebbi once appointed two brothers over the Kupah (even though they are believed only like one person).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is collecting considered imposing authority?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The collectors may take a security for the Tzedakah one must give, even on Erev Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak bar Shmuel):</span> "U'Fokadti Al Kol Lochatzav" applies even to collectors of Tzedakah!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> It refers to teachers like Rav Shmuel Shilas.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rav once found Rav Shmuel Shilas in the garden, and asked why he was not supervising the children, like he always does.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The two who collect Tzedakah may not separate from (and lose sight of) each other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may go to the gate (to collect) and another to a store (if they can see each other).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>If a collector of Tzedakah finds money in the market, he should not put it in his own wallet (lest people think he is stealing Tzedakah money), rather, he puts in the Tzedakah box;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, if someone pays his debt to a collector of Tzedakah in the market, he should not put it in his own wallet, rather, he puts in the Tzedakah box. When he gets home, he takes it.</p>
