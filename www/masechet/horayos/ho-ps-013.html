<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Par of the Kohen Gadol and the Par of the Tzibur... (we offer the Kohen's Par first).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Question:</span> He will burn (the Par of the Tzibur) like he burned the <i>first</i> Par" - what does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Par mentioned in the Parshah (of a Mashu'ach) is entirely offered before the Tzibur's Par.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If the Par of the Kohen Gadol and the Par of the Tzibur are waiting to be offered, the Kohen Gadol offers his Par first, because he atones, and the Tzibur gets atonement;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is proper that the atoner should get atonement before the ones he atones for - "(the Kohen Gadol) will atone for himself and his household and the whole congregation of Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If the Tzibur sinned due to Hora'ah in idolatry and another Mitzvah, the Par for the other Mitzvah is offered first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Par for the other Mitzvah is a Chatas, and the Par for idolatry is an Olah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "he will offer the Chatas <i>first</i>"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It need not teach that the Chatas is offered first. It already says "he will offer the second for an Olah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it teaches a general rule. A Chatas always precedes an Olah that accompanies it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Halachah is, even Chatas ha'Of (a bird) precedes an Olas Behemah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Par offered for idolatry precedes the Sa'ir for idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Par is an Olah and the Sa'ir is a Chatas! (The Chatas should be first!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar Mari):</span> "Chatas" is written missing an 'Aleph' to hint that it is not first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It says "like its law", i.e. like the order in which the Torah writes them. (The Par is mentioned first.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Tzibur's Sa'ir for idolatry precedes the Nasi's Sa'ir (Chatas).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Korban of the Tzibur precedes the Korban of an individual.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Nasi's Sa'ir precedes the Se'irah (Chatas) of a commoner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Korban of the king precedes that of a commoner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Se'irah of a commoner precedes the Kisvah of a commoner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> The Kisvah of a commoner precedes the Se'irah of a commoner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Tana'im argue which is offered first.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Tana of Beraisa #1 holds that a Se'irah has precedence, for a commoner must bring it for idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The Tana of Beraisa #2 holds that a Kisvah has precedence, because its tail is offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The Omer (the barley Minchah brought on the second day of Pesach) precedes the lamb brought with it. Shtei ha'Lechem (the Minchah brought on Shavu'os) precedes the lambs brought with it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The rule is, a Korban due to the day precedes a Korban that accompanies a Minchah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PRECEDENCES AMONG PEOPLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man precedes a woman regarding sustaining their lives and returning a lost object;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A woman precedes a man regarding clothing and to be redeemed from captivity;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If both are destined for sexual exploitation, we redeem the man first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven, his father and his Rebbi are all in captivity, Reuven first redeems himself, then his Rebbi, then his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If his mother was captured, he redeems her first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A Chacham precedes Melech Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because not everyone is qualified to be a Chacham, but everyone is qualified to reign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A king precedes the Kohen Gadol - "the Melech said (to the Kohen Gadol... ) 'of your master (i.e. myself)'."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A Kohen Gadol precedes a prophet - "Tzadok ha'Kohen and Noson ha'Navi" - Tzadok is mentioned first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, it says "Yehoshua ha'Kohen ha'Gadol, you and your colleagues."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps his colleagues are commoners.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "They are Anshei Mofes";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Mofes" denotes a prophet - "he will show you a sign or Mofes (wonder)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The hierarchy of Kohanim (from top down) is a Mashu'ach; a Merubah Begadim; a Mashu'ach she'Avar; a Mashu'ach who became blemished; Mashu'ach Milchamah; the Segan (the Kohen prepared to substitute, in case the Kohen Gadol becomes disqualified); and the Amarkal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Amarkal?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is the one who Amar Kula (says everything, i.e. the Kohen appointed over everyone, i.e. all Gizbarim (treasurers of Hekdesh)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>After the Amarkal are a Gizbar; a head of a Mishmar (one of the 24 divisions of Kohanim; the Mishmaros alternated serving in the Mikdash); a head of a Beis Av (one of six subdivisions of a Mishmar; each served one day of the week); and a regular Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Segan or the Mashu'ach Milchamah must become Tamei, which has precedence (to remain Tahor)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Nachman - Beraisa):</span> If the Segan and Mashu'ach Milchamah encountered an unattended corpse, the Mashu'ach Milchamah should bury it, for if the Kohen Gadol will be disqualified, the Segan will substitute for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> The Mashu'ach Milchamah is above the Segan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The Mashu'ach Milchamah has precedence regarding sustenance (but regarding Tum'ah, the Segan has precedence).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PRECEDENCE AMONG LINEAGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The hierarchy of lineages (from top down) - Kohen; Levi; Yisrael; Mamzer; Nasin (a descendant of the Giv'onim, who converted through trickery; Chachamim decreed that they are like slaves); convert; freed slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is when they are equal in Chachmah, but a Mamzer who is a Chacham precedes a Kohen Gadol that is an ignoramus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Kohen precedes Levi - "(Hash-m) separated Aharon to be Kodesh Kodoshim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Levi precedes Yisrael - "Hash-m separated the Shevet of Levi."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Yisrael precedes Mamzer, because a Yisrael has (proper) lineage, but a Mamzer does not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Mamzer precedes Nasin, because a Mamzer comes from a Yisrael, but a Nasin does not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A Nasin precedes a convert, because a Nasin grew up in Kedushah, but a convert did not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>A convert precedes a freed slave, because a convert is not cursed. A slave is cursed. (The greatest curse that No'ach found to curse Kena'an was that his descendants would be slaves. The Gemara does not mean that Stam slaves are from Kena'an. Yisrael were commanded to kill the Kena'anim - see Rashi on Vayikra 25:44.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This is when they are equal in Chachmah, but a Mamzer Chacham precedes an ignoramus Kohen Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> "(Torah) is dearer than Peninim (pearls)" it is dearer than a Kohen Gadol who enters LiFNaI v'LifNIM (the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> A freed slave <i>should</i> precede a convert, because a freed slave grew up in Kedushah, and a convert did not;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A convert comes first, because a convert is not cursed, but a slave is cursed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are men more eager to marry a convert than a freed slave?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok):</span> A convert is not cursed. A slave is cursed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Also, a convert guarded herself (from wanton relations, because she planned to convert). A freed slave did not guard herself (she did not know that she would be freed).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THINGS GOOD AND BAD FOR MEMORY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does a dog recognize his owner, but a cat does not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Eliezer):</span> One who eats from what a mouse ate from, he forgets. Cats eat mice, so all the more so they forget!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are mice constantly chased?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Eliezer):</span> They conduct wickedly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They bite even garments (even though they get no benefit from this).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> They bite even the handle of a shovel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Five things make one forget his learning:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Eating from what a mouse ate from;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Eating the heart of an animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Eating olives frequently;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Drinking water left over from washing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Washing one foot over the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Some say, also sleeping with his head on his clothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Five things restore one's learning:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Eating bread baked on coals (and all the more so, the coals themselves);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Eating a scrambled egg without salt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Frequent consumption of olive oil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Frequently drinking wine and smelling spices;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Drinking water left over from kneading a dough;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Some say, also sticking one's finger in salt and using that finger to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Beraisa said that regular consumption of olive oil restores learning. This supports R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Just like eating olives makes one forget the Torah he knew for 70 years, olive oil restores the Torah he knew for 70 years</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Frequently drinking wine and smelling spices (restore one's learning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>This supports Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Wine and fragrances sharpen one's mind.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Some say):</span> Also sticking one's finger in salt (restores one's learning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> This is when he eats with that one finger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Tana'im argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Eating with one finger (helps restore learning), but not eating with two;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, with two fingers helps, but not with three.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A sign to remember the (proper number to use according to the two) opinions is the ring finger. (One finger stands on one side of it, two fingers stand (together) on the other side).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Ten things cause difficulty in learning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Passing under the reins of a camel, and all the more so under a camel itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Passing between two camels; passing between two women; and a woman who passes between two men (causes difficulties for the men);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Passing where one can smell a carcass; passing under a bridge which has not had water under it for 40 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Eating bread that was not fully baked; eating the froth that accumulates on the spoon used to stir cooking meat; drinking from a stream that passes through a cemetery;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Looking at the face of a corpse;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Some say, also reading what is written on a tombstone.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>HONORING THE NASI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When the Nasi enters, all rise. They do not sit until he tells them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>When the Av Beis Din enters, everyone stands in two lines, on two sides. They do not sit until he sits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>When a Chacham enters, each person stands (when the Chacham enters within four Amos of the person) and sits (when the Chacham leaves his four Amos), until the Chacham sits in his place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The children of Chachamim and budding Chachamim - if the Tzibur needs them, they may walk (amidst people, even if they appear to walk) on the people's heads;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one left for a need, he may return to his place;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The children of Parnesim, i.e. Chachamim who are leaders of the Tzibur, if they understand what is taught, they sit in front, with their backs to the Tzibur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they do not understand, they sit in front of their fathers, facing the Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Tzadok says, even in a banquet hall, they sit by their fathers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one left for a need, he may return to his place.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> That is only if he left to urinate. If he left to relieve himself (move his bowels), he was negligent (for not checking himself earlier if he needs to go), so he may not return to his place.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One should relieve himself morning and evening, so he will not have to distance himself during the day (to find a suitable place).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Nowadays, people are weaker, and even to relieve oneself is not negligence, so he may return.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Tzadok):</span> Even in a banquet hall, they sit by their fathers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If their fathers are not there, they do not sit in a place of honor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This Beraisa (about standing for the Nasi) was taught in the days of R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel was the Nasi, R. Meir was a great Chacham, and R. Noson was the Av Beis Din. When any of them would enter, all would stand. R. Shimon ben Gamliel felt that the Nasi should be distinguished. He enacted the law of the Beraisa (which gives the greatest honor to the Nasi, then to the Av Beis Din, and then to a Chacham).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir and R. Noson were not present when the enactment was made. When they heard about it, R. Meir suggested to R. Noson that they ask R. Shimon ben Gamliel to teach Uktzim (a tractate that R. Shimon did not know).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This would be grounds to depose him. R. Noson would become the Nasi, and R. Meir would become the Av Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yakov ben Kodshi heard this. He was concerned lest R. Shimon be shamed. He hinted to him that he should learn Uktzim. R. Shimon did so, and he was able to teach it when R. Meir asked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon expelled R. Meir and R. Noson from the Beis Medrash. Questions that could not be answered in the Beis Medrash were sent outside to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> We should be in the place of Torah, outside with them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> They may re-enter the Beis Medrash, but they will be fined. Their teachings will not be said in their own names.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Meir's teachings (from then on) were recorded as "Others say"; R. Noson's teachings were recorded as "Some say."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Meir and R. Noson each had a dream in which he was shown that he should appease R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Noson did so. R. Meir did not, for we do not act based on dreams.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon (to R. Noson):</span> The golden belt of your father (who was Av Beis Din) helped you to become Av Beis Din. Should it make you the Nasi?!</p>
