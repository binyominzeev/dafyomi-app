<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>MASHU'ACH</i> DOES NOT BRING AN <i>ASHAM TALUY</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All agree that he does not bring an Asham Taluy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1 (for Rebbi):</span> "The Kohen will atone for Shigegaso (his mistake) Asher Shagag" - this applies to one who brings a Korban <i>only</i> due to Shegagah (without Hora'ah), and not to a Mashu'ach (for Mitzvos other than idolatry, he brings a Korban for Hora'ah with Shegagah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse does not say that his Korban is <i>always</i> due to Shegagah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, it does. It could have said just "for Shigegaso";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It adds "Asher Shagag" to teach that his sin is always due to Shegagah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2 (for Chachamim):</span> The verse discusses one whose brings a Korban for Shogeg (without Hora'ah), and not to a Mashu'ach (who is never liable for Shogeg without Hora'ah).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>HORA'AH</i> MUST PERMIT <i>KARES</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Din is liable only for (permitting) Chayavei Kerisus for which a Chatas is brought (if one was Shogeg); the same applies to a Mashu'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>They are liable for idolatry only for something punishable by Kares/Chatas (for Mezid/Shogeg).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this (regarding Mitzvos other than idolatry)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> We learn a Gezerah Shavah "Aleha-Aleha" from incest with one's wife's sister, which is punishable by Kares/Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is the source for Beis Din. What is the source regarding a Mashu'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "L'Ashmas ha'Am" equates a Mashu'ach to the Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We learn that this applies to a Nasi from a Gezerah Shavah "Mitzvos-Mitzvos."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The same applies to a commoner. "<i>And</i> if a soul" teaches that the law of a commoner is like the previous law (of a Nasi).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They are liable for idolatry only...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source regarding idolatry?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Idolatry was written separately to teach that a different Korban is brought;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they are liable even for something not punishable by Kares/Chatas?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We learn a Gezerah Shavah "me'Einei-me'Einei" from other Mitzvos. Just like by other Mitzvos, they are liable only for Chayavei Kerisus/Chatas, also by idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is the source for Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the source for a commoner, Nasi or a Mashu'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "And if <i>one soul</i>" includes a commoner, Nasi and a Mashu'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The 'Vov' ("<i>and</i>") teaches that the law of the previous Parshah (of Beis Din) applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi's starting point to learn all these laws was Beis Din, which was learned from a Gezerah Shavah 'Aleha-Aleha';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that "Aleha" teaches about relatives and their co-wives that fall to Yibum. How do they learn all these laws?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question (c)):</span> They learn like R. Yehoshua ben Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Regarding idolatry, it says "there will be one Torah (law) for you, for one who sins bi'Shgagah, and for Mezid" - the entire Torah is equated to idolatry:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like the punishment for idolatry is Kares if Mezid and Chatas if Shogeg, also for other Mitzvos, one brings a Chatas for Shogeg only if one would be Chayav Kares for Mezid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The verses before and after this discuss a "Nefesh", so this teaches about every individual, i.e. a commoner, Nasi or Mashu'ach, both for idolatry and other Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source regarding the Tzibur?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah discusses the Tzibur right before an individual. We learn the law of the Tzibur from that of an individual.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi learned from "Aleha-Aleha." How does he expound R. Yehoshua ben Levi's verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds like the following Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Torah distinguishes between a majority (of a city that served idolatry b'Mezid) and a minority. A majority (Ir ha'Nidachas) is killed through the sword, and their money (and the whole city) is destroyed. A minority is killed through stoning, and their money goes to their heirs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we distinguish between a majority that serves idolatry b'Shogeg and a minority!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "There will be one law to you..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Chilkiyah of Hegronya):</span> If not for this verse, they would have brought a different Korban. Which would they bring?! (It should be different than all other Korbanos, just like Par He'elem Davar for idolatry is different than all other Korbanos. On the other hand, we should not innovate a new Korban by ourselves. It should be a Korban brought for something else!)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be a Par. (This is not different, for) the Tzibur brings Parim for other Mitzvos!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It cannot be a Par for an Olah and a Sa'ir for a Chatas. The Tzibur brings this for idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>It cannot be a Sa'ir. A Nasi brings this for other Mitzvos!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>It cannot be a Se'irah. An individual brings this for idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> One might have thought that they bring a Par <i>Chatas</i> and a Sa'ir <i>Olah</i>, the opposite of what the Tzibur brings. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> One might have thought that they need to bring a different Korban, but they cannot (they do not get atonement).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Both Tana'im agree that the verses discuss idolatry. What is their source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> It says "all these Mitzvos." The Mitzvah equal to all the Mitzvos is idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (D'Vei Rebbi - Beraisa):</span> It says "that Hash-m spoke to Moshe", and "that Hash-m commanded you through Moshe."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mitzvah that Yisrael heard Hash-m say, and was explained through Moshe, is idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Yisrael heard "I (am Hash-m your G-d)" and "you will not have (other gods in front of Me)" from Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "From the day that Hash-m commanded" - the first Mitzvah Yisrael received was idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Yisrael received 10 Mitzvos at Marah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we must give one of the first two answers.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MITZVOS FOR WHICH BEIS DIN IS EXEMPT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Din is not liable for Hora'ah on a Lav or Aseh in the Mikdash (a Tamei person entering the Mikdash or delaying there, or eating Kodshim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One does not bring an Asham Taluy for a Lav or Aseh in the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Din is liable for a Lav or Aseh regarding Nidah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One brings an Asham Taluy for a Lav or Aseh regarding Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>An Aseh regarding Nidah is to separate from a Nidah (only after the Kishuy ceases, e.g. if she became Nidah during relations; Rashi - refrain from relations before a woman's Veses, i.e. her normal period when she becomes Nidah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Lav regarding Nidah is not to have relations with a Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of the first two laws?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Avdimi):</span> It says "v'Ashem (he transgressed)" regarding Chatas and Asham Taluy, and it says "v'Ashemu" regarding the Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like "v'Ashem" regarding an individual discusses a fixed Chatas (for which even a poor person must bring an animal), also regarding a Tzibur (it brings only for sins for which an individual brings a fixed Chatas);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Likewise, Asham Taluy is brought only for such sins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the same should apply to Oleh v'Yored (a varying Chatas, in which an Oni brings a bird, and a very poor person brings a Minchah (flour-offering))! It says "v'Hayah Ki <i>Yesham</i> l'Achas me'Eleh"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from "v'Ashem" from "v'Ashemu", for these are very similar (he or they sinned), but we do not learn to "Yesham (he <i>will</i> sin)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> We may learn, even though they are dissimilar!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> It says "v'Shav ha'Kohen" and "u'Va ha'Kohen." These both mean that he will return. We learn a Gezerah Shavah between them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> We should learn from "v'Ashem" regarding Tum'ah of the Mikdash and Kodshim (one brings Oleh v'Yored for this)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> We learn only when it says in both places "v'Ashem" and "Mitzvos Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> Why don't we learn between places where it mentions both "v'Ashem" and "bearing sin"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> We only learn between places where it says both "v'Ashem" and "Mitzvos Hash-m that may not be done."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE LAWS OF THE <i>NASI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Din is not liable for Hora'ah regarding Shevu'as ha'Edus (the oath that one does not know testimony), Shevu'as Bituy (that one will or will not do an action), or Tum'ah of the Mikdash and Kodshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi ha'Galili says, the Nasi has the same law;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says, the Nasi is liable for all of these except for the Shevu'as ha'Edus, because he does not judge and is not judged, and he does not testify and we do not testify about him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Ula) Question:</span> What is R. Yosi ha'Galili's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> "Ki Yesham <i>l'Achas</i> me'Eleh" - anyone who is liable for (any) one of these is liable for all. Anyone who is exempt for (any) one is exempt for all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We should say that he is liable for one, even though he is not liable for all!</p>
