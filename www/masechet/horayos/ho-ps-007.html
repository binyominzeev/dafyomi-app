<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN A <i>MASHU'ACH</i> BRINGS A <i>CHATAS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that he brings only when he sinned b'Shogeg due to a Hora'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "For the sin of the people" - the Mashu'ach is like the Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> We should know this without the verse! The Torah teaches that the Chatas of the Tzibur is unlike that of an individual, and also a Mashu'ach's Chatas is unlike an individual's;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like the Tzibur is liable only when most of Yisrael sinned b'Shogeg due to a Hora'ah, also a Mashu'ach is liable only when he sinned b'Shogeg due to Hora'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> Perhaps we should learn from a Nasi (king). The Chatas of a Nasi is unlike that of a commoner. Also a Mashu'ach's Chatas is unlike an individual's;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like a Nasi is liable even if his sin was not due to a mistaken ruling, also a Mashu'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Decision:</span> We learn from the Tzibur, for the law of a Mashu'ach Gadol is more similar to the Tzibur's law. Both bring Parim, and both never bring Asham Taluy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should learn from a Nasi, for also he is like a Mashu'ach in two laws. Each brings a Se'irah if he transgressed idolatry, and each can bring an Asham (Vadai)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> "For the sin of the people" - the Mashu'ach is like the Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If most of Yisrael sinned due to a Hora'ah of Beis Din, Beis Din is liable. Likewise, if they sinned due to a Hora'ah of a Mashu'ach, he should be liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "He will offer for the sin that he sinned" - he brings only for his own sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said that a Mashu'ach does not bring an Asham Taluy. What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "The Kohen will atone for the Shegagah that (an individual) Shagag" - Asham Taluy applies to one whose sin is b'Shogeg (e.g. he did not realize he is eating Chelev. This is like R. Chananel (printed on Daf 9a) and Rashash. Our (and Rashi's) text is difficult, for the verse does not mention 'Chataso');</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It does not apply to a Mashu'ach, for he brings (a Chatas) only due to Hora'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa exempted him from Asham Taluy <i>before</i> it brought the verse ("for the sin of the people") that teaches that he brings a Chatas only due to Hora'ah! (I.e. even without the verse, we would know that he is exempt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we only know this due to the verse. It was imprecise for the Beraisa to say (without the verse) that he is like a Tzibur because also he brings a Par <i>and</i> he is exempt from Asham Taluy. Really, (without the verse) we only have the first similarity.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN A <i>MASHU'ACH</i> NEEDS HIS OWN ATONEMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Mashu'ach relied on his own Hora'ah and sinned, he brings his own Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he ruled with the Beis Din, and sinned with the Tzibur, he gets atonement with the (Korban of) the Tzibur, because Beis Din is liable only if their Hora'ah partially permits and partially forbids, and the same applies to a Mashu'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also regarding idolatry, Beis Din is liable only if their Hora'ah partially permits and partially forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that if he sinned with the Tzibur, he gets atonement with the Tzibur?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If he ruled with the Beis Din, and sinned with the Tzibur, perhaps he brings his own Par!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is illogical! The Chatas of a Nasi is unlike that of a commoner, and a Mashu'ach's Chatas is unlike a commoner's;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a Nasi sins by himself, he brings his own Korban. If he sins with the Tzibur, he gets atonement with the Tzibur's Korban. The same should apply to a Mashu'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from a Nasi, for he gets atonement with the Tzibur's Korban on Yom Kipur, but a Mashu'ach does not! Therefore, the suggestion that a Mashu'ach should bring his own Korban is reasonable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection of Suggestion:</span> "For his sin that he sinned" - if he sins by himself, he brings his own Korban. If he sins with the Tzibur, he gets atonement with the Tzibur's Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He is Mufla (Rashi - the greatest Chacham; Tosfos ha'Rosh - proper for Hora'ah), and the Beis Din is not (Rashi - has no member as great as the Mashu'ach).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, obviously he brings his own Korban! The Hora'ah of Beis Din is invalid. The Tzibur does not bring a Korban, rather every individual who sinned brings a Chatas!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Beis Din is Mufla and he is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he could not bring his own Korban. His Hora'ah is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Both he and Beis Din are (Rashi - equally) Mufla'im.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SEPARATE RULINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The case when he gave a Hora'ah by himself (apparently, this is the proper text; Abaye explains the Mishnah) and sinned by himself is when he ruled about one Mitzvah in one place, and Beis Din ruled about a different Mitzvah in another place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> It does not matter where they rule!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, even if they ruled in the same place, if they ruled about different Mitzvos, it is considered that he sinned by himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Obviously, if he permitted Chelev, and Beis Din permitted idolatry, these are separate rulings, because they are learned from different verses <i>and</i> different Korbanos are brought for them (he brings a Par, and they bring a Par and Sa'ir).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All the more so, if he permitted idolatry, and Beis Din permitted Chelev, these are separate rulings, because the Korbanos are totally different (he brings a Sa'ir, and they bring a Par).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If he permitted Chelev covering the Kerev (stomachs), and Beis Din permitted Chelev of the small intestines, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though the same Korban is brought for either, since they are learned from different verses, they are separate rulings;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since both are called Chelev, it is like one ruling?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If you will say that all Chelev has the same name, if he permitted Chelev, and Beis Din permitted blood, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since they are learned from different verses, they are separate rulings;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since the same Korban is brought for either, it is like one ruling?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This question is unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Din is liable only if the Hora'ah partially permits and partially forbids...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learned this in the first Perek. "And <i>a matter</i> was hidden", but the whole Mitzvah was not hidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The same applies to a Mashu'ach.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "L'Ashmas ha'Am" - a Mashu'ach is like the Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Also regarding idolatry (Beis Din is liable only if the Hora'ah partially permits and partially forbids)...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Idolatry was written separately to teach that a different Korban is brought;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps there is another difference, that Beis Din is liable even for a Hora'ah to uproot an entire Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We learn a Gezerah Shavah "me'Einei-me'Einei" from the Korban Beis Din brings for mistaken Hora'ah about other Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding other Mitzvos, Beis Din is liable only for partially uprooting a matter. The same applies to idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CONDITIONS FOR THE <i>KORBAN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Din is liable only for Hora'ah and (the resulting) transgressions b'Shogeg. The same applies to a Mashu'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Also regarding idolatry, Beis Din is liable only for Hora'ah with Shegagah.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "they will err" teaches that Beis Din is liable for regular Shegagah!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ... And also a Mashu'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "L'Ashmas ha'Am" - a Mashu'ach is like the Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Also regarding idolatry they are liable only for Hora'ah with Shegagah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Idolatry was written separately to teach that a different Korban is brought;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Beis Din is liable for regular Shegagah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We learn from "me'Einei- me'Einei." Just like Beis Din is liable for other Mitzvos only for Hora'ah with Shegagah, also regarding idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Mishnah does not say that a Mashu'ach is liable for idolatry only for Hora'ah with Shegagah! (This implies that he is liable for Shegagah without Hora'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> A Mashu'ach is liable for idolatry b'Shogeg;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim exempt, unless it was due to his Hora'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>All agree that (when he is liable) he brings a Sa'ir, and that a Mashu'ach never brings an Asham Taluy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The inference is unfounded. Also, the Mishnah does not say that he is liable only if he permits Chayavei Kerisus for which a Chatas is brought (if Shogeg), but surely this is true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You must say that this was taught regarding other Mitzvos, and it applies also to idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, we taught regarding other Mitzvos that he is liable only for Hora'ah with Shegagah, and this applies also to idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "The Kohen will atone for the soul that errs in sinning bi'Shgagah":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The soul" refers to a Mashu'ach. "That errs" refers to a Nasi. "In sinning bi'Shgagah" refers to unintentional sin (even if not due to Hora'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that "in sinning bi'Shgagah" refers to one who brings a Chatas for Shogeg, to exclude a Mashu'ach, who is liable only due to Hora'ah.</p>
