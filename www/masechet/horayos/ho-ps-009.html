<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THOSE EXEMPT FROM <i>OLEH </i>V<i>'YORED</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he learns as follows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yirmeyah):</span> It says "he cannot afford." This applies to one who can become poor or rich. It excludes a Nasi or a Mashu'ach, who never become poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Nasi is never poor. "Hash-m Elokav" teaches that only Hash-m is above him;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>A Mashu'ach is never poor. "The Kohen who is greater than his brothers" teaches that he is greater in beauty, strength, Chachmah and wealth;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Others say '"that is greater from his brothers" - if he is not wealthiest, the other Kohanim give to him money to make him the wealthiest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If a Nasi transgressed (something for which one brings Oleh v'Yored) and became a Metzora, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is he exempt only while he is considered Nasi, but now he is liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since before he was unable to bring the Korban, he never brings it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> He pays from his treasury, and not from yours! (Rashi - his treasury never runs out, so he is exempt; Ramah - since he must take from his own wealth, he cannot currently collect taxes, he is liable like a regular rich person, who could wax poor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> A Mashu'ach is exempt from all of these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is R. Akiva's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "<i>This</i> (Minchah) is the Korban of Aharon and his children" is the only obligatory Minchah of a Kohen Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this excludes him only from the Korban of the most destitute, i.e. a Minchah, but he brings the Oleh v'Yored of a (moderately) poor or rich person!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "The Kohen will atone for the sin that he sinned <i>me'Achas me'Eleh</i>" - one who gets atonement through (any) one of these (a Minchah, bird or animal), gets atonement through all. One who does not atone through (any) one of these, does not atone through any of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should also say "Ki Yesham l'Achas me'Eleh" - one who is liable for (any) one of these (Aveiros for which one brings Oleh v'Yored), is liable for all. One who is not liable for (any) one of these, is not liable for any of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> A Nasi is liable for all, except for Shevu'as ha'Edus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye and Rava):</span> The Tana expounds "me'Achas". He does not expound "l'Achas."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he expound only "me'Achas"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah wrote this at the end, regarding the Minchah, to teach that anyone who can bring the Minchah (this excludes a Kohen Gadol) can bring the others;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Halachah were that one who is exempt from one of these is liable for the others, "l'Achas" should have been written regarding an animal or bird.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DIFFERENT <i>CHATA'OS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A commoner brings a Se'irah or Kisvah for any Mitzvah punishable by Kares (b'Mezid) and a Chatas (b'Shogeg);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Nasi brings a (male) Sa'ir. A Mashu'ach or Beis Din brings Parim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For idolatry, a commoner, Nasi or Mashu'ach brings a Se'irah. Beis Din brings a Par for an Olah and a (male) Sa'ir for a Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A commoner or Nasi brings Asham Taluy. A Mashu'ach or Beis Din is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A commoner, Nasi or Mashu'ach brings Asham Vadai. Beis Din is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon says, for Shevu'as ha'Edus, Shevu'as Bituy, or Tum'ah (of the Mikdash and Kodshim), Beis Din is exempt, and a commoner or Nasi is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Mashu'ach is liable for either Shevu'ah. He is exempt for Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Whoever is liable brings the standard Oleh v'Yored;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer says, a Nasi brings a Sa'ir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> The general rule is, whenever a commoner brings Asham Taluy, a Nasi does also. A Mashu'ach or Beis Din is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Whenever a commoner brings Asham Vadai, a Nasi or Mashu'ach does also. Beis Din is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For Shevu'as ha'Edus, Shevu'as Bituy, or Tum'ah of the Mikdash and Kodshim, Beis Din is exempt. A commoner, Nasi or Mashu'ach is liable (for at least some of these);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Nasi is exempt for Shevu'as ha'Edus, and a Mashu'ach is exempt for Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>A Nasi is like a commoner regarding Oleh v'Yored. A Mashu'ach or Beis Din is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa contradicts itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It exempts a Mashu'ach for Tum'ah. This implies that he is liable for either Shevu'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Then it says that a Nasi is like a commoner regarding Oleh v'Yored, but a Mashu'ach or Beis Din is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like Beis Din is exempt from all of them, also a Mashu'ach!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> A Mashu'ach is exempt from the cheapest Korban (a Minchah), but not from a bird or animal (if he is moderately poor or rich).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon agrees with R. Akiva (who totally exempts a Mashu'ach) in one respect, and argues in another:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He agrees that he is exempt from bringing a Minchah, but not from a bird or animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> However, a Mashu'ach is exempt for Tum'ah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Chizkiyah):</span> What is R. Shimon's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> "That soul will be cut off from the Tzibur" refers to one whose Korban is like that of the Tzibur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This excludes a Mashu'ach, who brings a different Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also a Nasi brings a different Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Nasi gets atonement with the Tzibur (through the Sa'ir) on Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, all Kohanim should be exempt, for their atonement on Yom Kipur is through the Par!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regular Kohanim get atonement with the Tzibur (when Parim for mistaken Hora'ah are brought).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A Mashu'ach also gets atonement with the Tzibur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The verse discusses one who is liable for sin like (a minority of) the Tzibur (i.e. for Shegagah alone. This excludes a Mashu'ach.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>R. ELIEZER'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> A Nasi brings a Sa'ir...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Eliezer says this only regarding Tum'ah of the Mikdash and Kodshim, which are Chayavei Kerisus, just like sins punishable by a fixed Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Papa):</span> Surely R. Eliezer does not say this regarding every Oleh v'Yored!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Sa'ir of a Nasi and the Par of a Mashu'ach are in place of the Chatas of a commoner. If R. Eliezer held that a Nasi brings a Sa'ir for every Oleh v'Yored, he should say also that a Mashu'ach brings a Par for (every one, including) Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since he did not say this, he must hold that a Nasi brings only for Tum'ah, for which a Mashu'ach is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Noson):</span> Perhaps R. Eliezer said this for every Oleh v'Yored. He did not mention a Mashu'ach, because he holds like R. Akiva, that a Mashu'ach is exempt for all of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> R. Akiva said only that he does not bring Oleh v'Yored, but he brings a Par.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Eliezer admits that a Nasi does not bring an Asham (Taluy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> An Asham Taluy is brought for Tum'ah of the Mikdash and Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes):</span> Your Beraisa like R. Eliezer. Because they are Chayavei Kerisus and a Nasi brings a Sa'ir, an Asham Taluy is also brought for them. (We do not bring Asham Taluy for Aveiros for which Asham Taluy is brought (8b). Regarding a Nasi, it is not like an Aveirah of Asham Taluy.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan taught that R. Eliezer admits that a Nasi does not bring an Asham Taluy!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK KOHEN MASHI'ACH</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE WHO WAS DEMOTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Mashu'ach sinned, and then he was removed from his position, or if a Nasi sinned and was dethroned, the Kohen brings a Par, the Nasi brings a Sa'ir;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If they sinned after they were demoted, the Kohen brings a Par, the Nasi is like a commoner.</p>
