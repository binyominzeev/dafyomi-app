<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES THE TORAH PUNISH FOR <i>AVEIROS</i> THAT DO NOT TAKE EFFECT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (against Rava - Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael (raped a woman and) divorced her, he remarries her, and he is not lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He should be lashed for acting contrary to Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1A (Rashi) Answer:</span> No, the Isur is "Shalchah Kol Yamav," to permanently divorce her. (He did not do so, for he always has a Mitzvah to remarry her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1B (Tosfos) Answer:</span> He is exempt because the Lav is Nitak l'Aseh. It is a Mitzvah to <i>re</i>marry her "Kol Yamav." (The one who asked thought that the Lav is not Nitak l'Aseh, for the Aseh to marry her precedes the Isur to divorce her.) (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to Abaye, why must it say "Kol Yamav"? Even without this, we would know that he is not lashed, for he did not accomplish anything, since he can (Gra, Bach - must) remarry her! (Likewise, every counter-question we will ask against Abaye/Rava is that without the verse we would know that he accomplished something/did not accomplish anything.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it not said this, we would have thought that he is permitted but not obligated to remarry her.  The verse obligates him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 Question (against Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael divorced Anusaso, he remarries her, and he is not lashed. If a Kohen did so, he is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should say that he accomplished something, i.e. he need not remarry her! (We are thinking that the Isur is "l'Shalchah Kol Yamav," to permanently divorce her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah teaches that there is a Mitzvah to remarry her "Kol Yamav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to Rava, why must it say "Kol Yamav"? Even without this, he did not accomplish anything, and must remarry her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it not said this, we would have thought that he is lashed and he must remarry her. The verse causes the Lav to be Nitak l'Aseh, so he is not lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava):</span> We must be Torem (designate to be Terumah) "mi'Kol Chelbo" (from good produce), yet if one is Torem bad produce, it takes effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not be Torem bad produce on (i.e. to exempt) good produce (of Tevel). If he did, it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A verse teaches that it takes effect:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila'i):</span> If one is Torem bad produce on good produce, it takes effect - "v'Lo Sis'u Alav Chet ba'Harimechem Es Chelbo." (Without the verse, we would know that he is liable for acting contrary to Torah, so) the verse must teach that it takes effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to Abaye, why must it say "v'Lo Sis'u Alav Chet"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the ideal Mitzvah is to be Torem good produce, but one who did not do so is not called a sinner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye):</span> The Torah commands "Kol Chelev Yitzhar (v'Kol Chelev Sirosh)," to tithe from each species onto itself. B'Di'eved, tithing on a different species does not take effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Terumah (and Ma'aser) may not be taken from a species on a different species; if this was done, it does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye and R. Ila'a):</span> "Reishisam" (plural) teaches that each species must be tithed by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to Rava, why must it say "Reishisam"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, "Chelev Yitzhar v'Kol Chelev Sirosh v'Dagen" obligates tithing Yitzhar (olives) and Sirosh (grapes) separately (each gets its own Chelev). However, one Chelev is written for grapes and Dagan (grain). We would not know that one who tithes them (or different kinds of grain) one on the other is lashed (according to a second version, transgresses). We learn this from "Reishisam".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TRANSGRESSIONS WITH <i>KODSHIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye):</span> The Torah says that Cherem cannot be sold or redeemed. Even b'Di'eved, it does not take effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chermei Kohanim cannot be redeemed. They must be given to Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Kodesh Kodashim Hu," to teach that it remains Kodesh (until it is given to Kohanim).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to Rava, why must it say "Kodesh Kodashim Hu"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Hu" excludes Bechor (it may be sold):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It says regarding Bechor "Lo Sifdeh," but it may be sold;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says regarding Ma'aser "Lo Yiga'el." It may not be (redeemed nor) sold alive or slaughtered, Tam or Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava):</span> The Torah forbids to make Temurah. If one did, it takes effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Temurah is not permitted. Rather, if one made Temurah, it takes effect, and he receives 40 lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "... V'Hayah Hu u'Semuraso Yihyeh Kodesh" teaches that it takes effect. (Tosfos - surely, the one who asked knew the verse! Really, this question merely prepares the next question.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to Abaye, why must it say "Hu u'Semuraso Yihyeh Kodesh"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that (the Chulin animal becomes Kodesh and) the Kodesh animal becomes Chulin. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye):</span> The Torah forbids redeeming Bechor, and doing so does not help!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any Korban or Temurah that has a Mum may be redeemed, except for Bechor and Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Hem" teaches that they retain their Kedushah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to Rava, why must it say "Hem"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This forbids offering their Temuros.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Abaye's source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Im Shor Im Seh la'Shem <i>Hu</i>" teaches that it is offered, but its Temurah is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> What does Rava learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (and retraction of Answer (d)):</span> Indeed, he agrees that "... la'Shem Hu" teaches that Temuras Bechor or Ma'aser is not offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Hem" teaches that if blood of a Korban was mixed with Dam Bechor or Ma'aser, it is offered on the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Abaye's source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "v'Lakach mi'Dam ha'Par umi'Dam ha'Sa'ir" (the bloods of the bull and goat mixed together);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A bull has more blood than a goat (the latter should be Batel, the Torah should call the mixture "Dam ha'Par," for it is the majority!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Olim (things offered on the Mizbe'ach) do not Mevatel (nullify) each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yoshayah):</span> "v'Lakach mi'Dam ha'Par umi'Dam ha'Sa'ir" teaches that the bloods of the bull and goat must be mixed together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't Rava learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like R. Yonasan, who says that the bloods are not mixed. Each is put by itself on the Keranos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye):</span> The Torah forbids redeeming Ma'aser. Even b'Di'eved, it does not take effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any Korban or Temurah that has a Mum may be redeemed, except for Bechor and Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn Ma'aser from a Gezeirah Shavah "Ha'avarah-Ha'avarah" from Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER QUESTIONS AGAINST RAVA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava):</span> The Torah forbids taking Terumah or Ma'aser out of order. B'Di'eved, it takes effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one separated tithes out of order, even though he transgressed a Lav, it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "mi'Kol Matnoseichem Tarimu" (sometimes Terumah must be taken from tithes, e.g. if one tithed out of order).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> What does Abaye learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is needed to answer Rav Papa's question. (If a Levi took Ma'aser from sheaves before Terumah was given, he does not give Terumah Gedolah from it. We learn from "Ma'aser Min ha'Ma'aser," but not Terumas Ma'aser and Terumah Gedolah from Ma'aser).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If so, the same should apply even if the Ma'aser was taken from a Kri (pile of grain)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> In this case we apply "mi'Kol Matnoseichem Tarimu."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should exempt Ma'aser from a Kri, and obligate Ma'aser from sheaves?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We obligate Ma'aser from a Kri because it was processed enough to obligate giving Terumah, Ma'aser from sheaves was not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava):</span> A Kohen Gadol may not marry a widow. If he did, it takes effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman is forbidden to a man, but he can be Mekadesh her (e.g. a widow to a Kohen Gadol), the lineage of their children follows the parent of worse lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn this from "v'Lo Yechalel Zar'o." (If a Kohen Gadol marries a widow, the children are Chalalim (devoid of Kedushas Kehunah), and not Mamzerim. Rashi - it follows that he can be Mekadesh her. Tosfos - the extra "Lamed" in "Yechalel" teaches that he can be Mekadesh her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to Abaye, it could have said merely "v'Lo Yechal"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The extra "Lamed" teaches that (through relations) he makes also his wife a Chalalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava):</span> The Torah forbids to be Makdish a Ba'al Mum for a Korban. B'Di'eved, it takes effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was Makdish a Ba'al Mum for a Korban, even though he transgressed a Lav, it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ul'Neder Lo Yeratzeh" teaches that it may not be offered, but it is Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to Abaye, why must it say "ul'Neder Lo Yeratzeh"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he transgressed, and the Korban may be offered. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
