<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> (Initial) Hekdesh of limbs and fetuses takes effect, but they cannot become Kodesh through Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot say that this refers to fetuses in Kodshim, they are automatically Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that (initial) Hekdesh of limbs and on fetuses takes effect, (and because this is Mekadesh the entire animal,) Temurah can take effect on the animal - Rashi; Tosfos' text deletes this) but Temurah of a limb (of Chulin on a Korban) does not take effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Temurah does not take effect on a fetus in a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question - Inference:</span> Temurah on fetuses inside Kodshim does not take effect, but after they are born, it would take effect! (A Mishnah teaches unlike this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Temurah does not take effect on Vlados Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It cannot be like R. Yehudah, for he holds that if one is Makdish a limb, the entire animal does not become Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah refers to a limb whose removal would make the animal Tereifah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about whether a fetus can become Kodesh:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one slaughtered a Chatas and found a four-month (non-viable) fetus inside, only male Kohanim may eat it, in the Azarah, for one day and a night;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> Anyone may eat it, (at any time, but only) outside of the Azarah (for it is Chulin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> (The Beraisos discuss Vlados Kodshim.) Tana #1 holds that Vlados Kodshim become Kodesh in the womb. Tana #2 holds that they are not Kodesh until they are born.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> One Tana taught both Beraisos. In Beraisa #1, he was Makdish a pregnant animal. In Beraisa #2 it became pregnant after he was Makdish it. (The Tana holds that Vlados Kodshim become Kodesh when they are born.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 Question (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> The following animals do not become Kadosh and are not Mekadesh other animals:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tereifah, Kil'ayim, Yotzei Dofen, Tumtum and Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They do not become Kadosh through Temurah, and (even if they are Kedoshim) they are not Mekadesh other animals through Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir) Question:</span> Since they are not Kedoshim, how could they make Temurah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was Makdish an animal, and then it became Tereifah. He was Makdish a fetus, and then it was born Yotzei Dofen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> This shows that Hekdesh of a fetus takes effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Bar Pada agrees that Hekdesh of a fetus (in a Tam mother) takes effect. They argue about Hekdesh of a fetus in a Ba'al Mum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bar Pada holds that since the mother does not get Kedushas ha'Guf, also the fetus does not become Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan considers them like two animals. Since the fetus is Tam, it becomes Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (some delete this entire version from the text) Question (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> The following animals do not become Kadosh and are not Mekadesh:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tereifah, Kil'ayim, Yotzei Dofen, Tumtum and Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The only case of Kil'ayim, Tumtum and Androginus is Vlados Kodshim, according to R. Yehudah, who says that Vlados Kodshim make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> These Pesulim do not become Kodesh in the womb, but regular fetuses do!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Bar Pada agrees that Hekdesh of a fetus in a Tam mother takes effect. They argue about Hekdesh of a fetus in a Ba'al Mum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bar Pada holds that since the mother does not get Kedushas ha'Guf, the fetus gets only Kedushas Damim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan holds that Ubar Lav Yerech Imo. Even though the mother does not get Kedushas ha'Guf, the fetus does.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> If one is Makdish the leg of a Chulin animal...</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir and R. Yehudah) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if one says "the leg of this animal is an Olah", the entire animal becomes an Olah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Kol Asher Yiten <i>Mimenu la'Shem</i> Yihyeh Kodesh" teaches that only part of the animal is la'Shem (Kodesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the animal can become Chulin (through redemption)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yihyeh (it will be) Kodesh."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rather, it is sold to one who must bring an Olah. The money is Chulin, except for the value of the limb that was Hukdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi and R. Shimon):</span> What is the source that if one says "the leg of this animal is an Olah", the entire animal becomes an Olah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol Asher Yiten Mimenu la'Shem (even if only part was Hukdash) Yihyeh (it will be totally) Kodesh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It is sold to one who must bring an Olah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One who vowed to bring an Olah must Makdish and bring an entire animal. The buyer was not Makdish the leg. It is as if his Korban is Chaser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, the buyer had vowed to bring a Korban "b'Chayeha" (enough that could live. He never accepted to bring a complete animal. Some explain that he accepted to pay a Zuz for an Olah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> R. Yehudah admits that if one was Makdish a limb whose removal would make the animal Tereifah, the entire animal becomes Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He admits about a limb whose removal would make it Neveilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> He admits about a limb vital to life. (Its removal would kill the animal.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Rav Chisda and Rava argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether or not a Tereifah can live. Rav Chisda holds that it cannot, and Rava holds that it can.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Rava and Rav Sheshes argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about R. Elazar's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If the thigh and its cavity were removed, the animal is a Neveilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava holds like R. Elazar. Rav Sheshes disagrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> R. Yehudah's opinion is Nir'eh (correct) regarding a non-vital limb. R. Yosi's opinion is Nir'eh regarding a vital limb.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand "R. Yehudah's opinion is Nir'eh regarding a non-vital limb". Surely, they argue about this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"R. Yosi's opinion is Nir'eh regarding a vital limb" shows that they argue even about a vital limb. This refutes all three Amora'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated. Rebbi means 'R. Yosi's opinion is Nir'eh (appears correct) <i>to R. Yehudah</i> (i.e. R. Yehudah agrees with him) regarding a vital limb';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah argues only about a non-vital limb. (In that case, R. Yehudah's opinion is Nir'eh to me (Rebbi).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Does R. Yosi hold that if one is Makdish a limb of a bird, the entire bird becomes Hekdesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He learns from "Kol Asher Yiten Mimenu la'Shem Yihyeh Kodesh". This applies only to Behemos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps it applies to any Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>This question is unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> (According to R. Yosi,) if one was Makdish a limb for Kedushas Damim, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say since the limb gets Kedushas Damim, it gets Kedushas ha'Guf, and once it gets Kedushas ha'Guf, it spreads to the whole animal?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps we say only one Migo!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can learn from Rava himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one was Makdish a male (Kedushas Damim) to buy an Olah, it itself is offered for an Olah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, there is only one Migo. Perhaps we do not apply Migo twice. (Shitah Mekubetzes asks that this was the whole question! He answers that the answerer understood that the question was whether we say since it gets Kedushas Damim, it gets Kedushas ha'Guf. Rava explained that he asked whether we apply Migo twice.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>HEKDESH</i> OF PART OF AN ANIMAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one was Makdish a limb, may one shear it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can learn from the following Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> ("V'Lo Sagoz Bechor <i>Tzonecha</i>",) but you may shear a Bechor belonging to you and others (Nochrim, since it is not all Kodesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1A - Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from there. There, it did not get Kedushah at all. Here, the limb got Kedushah. (The question was according to R. Yehudah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1B (Shitah) Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from there. There, the entire animal did not get Kedushah. Here, the entire animal becomes Kodesh (according to R. Yosi. According to R. Yehudah, we cannot learn for the following reason.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from there. There, he could not be Mekadesh the entire animal. Here, he could Mekadesh the entire animal! (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If one was Makdish an animal's skin, may he work with the animal? (Rashi - he did not ask about shearing it, for surely that is permitted. It does not weaken the skin. R. Gershom - surely it is forbidden, for it weakens the skin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If one said "the fetus inside this animal is an Olah", one may shear the animal. One may not work with it, for this weakens the fetus. (Likewise, it weakens the skin!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> (Perhaps) the Beraisa forbids mid'Rabanan. (I ask whether one is lashed mid'Oraisa for working with it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If the Beraisa discusses Isurim mid'Rabanan, it should forbid also shearing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Chachamim decreed only against working, for this weakens the fetus.</p>
