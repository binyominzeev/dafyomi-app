<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>One may not burn Nikbarim. One may not bury Nisrafim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah permits to be stringent and burn Nikbarim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> This is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> Hair of a Nazir is buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Tavi - Mishnah):</span> If the length of a Sit (as far as one can separate his thumb from his index finger) of wool of a Bechor was woven into a garment, it must be burned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Sit of hair of a Nazir or a Peter Chamor was woven into Sak (sackcloth), the Sak must be burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (Rav Nachman (and R. Elazar)):</span> Hair of a Nazir Tahor must be burned (under the pot in which his Shelamim is cooked). Hair of a Nazir Tamei is buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Tavi):</span> That answers for hair of a Nazir. It does not resolve the contradiction regarding hair of a Peter Chamor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Nachman could not answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2 (Rav Tavi citing Rav Sheshes (also, R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina)):</span> If the hair was woven into Sak, it must be burned. (It will not decay quickly. If it were buried, someone might find it and benefit from it.) The hair itself may be buried. (We explain the following like the Gra on Orlah 3:3.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> (You say that we burn something that should be buried, and transgressed a mid'Rabanan law, lest someone benefit from it. Benefit is only mid'Rabanan, but mid'Oraisa,) the hair is Batel in the majority of Sak!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, the hair was used to make a design of a bird. (Therefore it is not Batel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, it can be removed! (Why must the whole Sak be burned?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Yehudah, who permits burning Nikbarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That does not answer why it is not Batel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (i) - R. Yirmeyah):</span> I meant that if the design can be removed, it is removed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, the whole Sak should be burned. Our Mishnah is like R. Yehudah, who permits burning Nikbarim. (Since he permits burning it, this is preferable, even if there is no design.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Nisrafim... (Chametz on Pesach... )</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Our Stam (anonymous) Mishnah requires burning Chametz during Pesach. This is like R. Yehudah, who says that Bi'ur (eradication of) Chametz must be through burning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Tamei Terumah, Orlah, Kil'ai ha'Kerem... (what can be burned is burned. What is normally buried is buried.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Solid foods are burned, and liquids are buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chatas ha'Of ha'Ba Al ha'Safek (is burned).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> It is dissected into limbs and cast into the Amah. It flows into Nachal Kidron.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not burn Nikbarim...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ashes of Nisrafim are permitted (because its Mitzvah was done). Ashes of Nikbarim are forbidden. (If Nikbarim are burned, people might benefit from the ashes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ashes of Nikbarim are (sometimes) permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If flesh of a corpse or (dried) Dam Nidah crumbled, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They are Tehorim and permitted (b'Hana'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, they are Tehorim and forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Pinchas - Beraisa):</span> After Mitzuy of Olas ha'Of (pressing it against the Mizbe'ach to squeeze out the blood), Me'ilah does not apply to the crop and feathers. (They are thrown next to the ramp of the Mizbe'ach and miraculously swallowed into the floor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Me'ilah does not apply to them, and they are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, Me'ilah does not apply to them but they are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ashes of Kodshim ha'Nisrafim are forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Ashes of all Nisrafim are permitted, except for those of an Asheirah (a tree planted to be worshipped);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(There is another exception.) Ashes of Hekdesh are always forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why were the two exceptions taught separately?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Nochri can be Mevatel an Asheirah (if he decides not to worship it any more and defaces it), but Hekdesh cannot become Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of (primary) question:</span> It says that ashes of Hekdesh are always forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> The case is, Hekdesh caught fire by itself. (Had someone burned it, he would transgress Me'ilah, and the Hekdesh would become Chulin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Shemayah):</span> The Beraisa refers to Terumas ha'Deshen (ashes taken off the Mizbe'ach every day). It is always forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Samo" teaches that all the ashes must be placed down, gently, (Rambam - in a place shielded from wind and pigs,) in order that they will not scatter.</p>
