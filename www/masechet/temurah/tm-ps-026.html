<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TWO <i>KEDUSHOS</i> IN ONE ANIMAL (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yitzchak b'Rebbi Yosef):</span> All agree that if he stipulated that one Temurah should take effect after the other, only the first takes effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree that if he stipulated that one should not take effect unless the other takes effect, both take effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue only in the case of our Mishnah, in which he said "Temuras Olah Temuras Shelamim";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Meir holds that (had he intended for both at the same time) he should have said "Temuras Olah v'Shelamim". Rather, he said "Temuras Olah Temuras Shelamim", because he wanted them to take effect one after the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yosi holds that (he intended for both at the same time;) he did not say "Temuras Olah v'Shelamim," for he thought that then it could not be offered. Therefore, he said "Temuras Olah Temuras Shelamim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one said "half of this animal is Temuras Olah, half is Temuras Shelamim," it is offered for an Olah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, it is Ro'eh. Half the Damim is used to buy Olah, and half is used for Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi says, if he intended for this from the beginning, since one cannot say two things simultaneously, his words take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi does not disagree with Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the entire Seifa is R. Yosi. He says his law, and then explains it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi) (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one (who was not obligated to bring a Chatas) said "half of this animal is Olah, half is Chatas," it is offered for an Olah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos, according to Tosefta) (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one said "half of this animal is Temuras Olah, half is Temuras Chatas," it is offered for an Olah. (Throughout this discussion, according to Tosfos he was always Memir, and not Makdish.) (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Yosi says, it must die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>They agree that if one said "half of this animal is Chatas, half is Olah," it must die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, this teaches that R. Meir agrees. This is obvious! (We follow his first words, so it is a Chatas, but has no obligation to bring one.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that R. Meir's reason is not because we follow his first words, rather, because an animal with two Kedushos (one of which may be offered), even if he said "half-Chatas" first. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said "half of this animal is Olah, half is Shelamim," it is Kadosh, but it cannot be offered. It makes Temurah, its Temurah is like it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Yosi. (We are concerned also for his last words.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously, it is Kadosh but cannot be offered!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is its Temurah. One might have thought that it cannot be offered, but its Temurah can be. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be offered because its Kedushah is Nidcheh. The same applies to its Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>DICHUY</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one of two partners in an animal was Makdish his half, bought his partner's half, and was Makdish that also:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The animal is Kodesh, but it cannot be offered. If one makes Temurah on it, the Temurah has the same law as it.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We learn three laws from this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Dichuy applies to money (R. Chananel, cited in Tosfos to Zevachim 12a - when redeemed, the money cannot be used for the purpose for which it was Hukdash. Rashi - Dichuy applies to monetary Kedushah; the animal can never be offered, even if the Pesul goes away);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A living animal can be Nidcheh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Dichuy from the start is considered Dichuy (and it can never be offered).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> All agree that if one said "half of this animal is Olah, half is Ma'aser," it is offered for an Olah. (His latter words have no effect. Tosfos - the case is, he was Makdish when the minority of the tenth left the pen. Kedushas Ma'aser takes effect when the majority leaves. Rashi - he was not counting animals. All agree that Hekdesh of half an animal spreads to the whole animal.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If one said "half of this animal is Temurah, half is Ma'aser," what is the law? (Rashi - he did not have a Korban nearby that could make Temurah; R. Gershom - he did not specify the Kodesh animal.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps it is offered like a Temurah, for Temurah (is more encompassing, since it) applies to all Kodshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps it is offered like a Ma'aser, for Ma'aser is Mekadesh what comes in front of and in back of it (the ninth and 11th), if they were called "tenth")!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WORDS THAT MAKE <i>TEMURAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said "this (animal) is Tachas Zu (in place of this)," or "Temuras Zu," or "Chalifas Zu," it becomes Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said "it is Mechuleles Al (redeemed onto) Zu," it is not Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Hekdesh animal was a Ba'al Mum, it becomes Chulin. He must compensate (if the new animal is worth less than the old Hekdesh; Rashi - Hekdesh must be redeemed on an animal of the same value).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> Tachas connotes Hatpasah (making something Kodesh through Temurah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Regarding Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis, if one said "Chalifas Zu," or "Temuras Zu," it does not take effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said "(It is) Tachas Zu" or "Mechuleles Al Zu," it takes effect (to redeem the Chulin).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Tachas connotes Hatpasah, what is the difference between the Reisha (when it does not take effect) and the Seifa?</p>
