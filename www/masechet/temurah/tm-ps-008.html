<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> It says regarding Bechor "Lo Sifdeh", but it may be sold;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When does this apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is nowadays.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Seifa):</span> "Es Damam Tizrok Al ha'Mizbe'ach" - there is no Mizbe'ach nowadays!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be when the Mikdash stands!</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It discusses a Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Seifa):</span> "Es Damam Tizrok... " - a Ba'al Mum cannot be offered!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It discusses a Tam.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The Beraisa permits selling a Tam when the Mikdash stands!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. (We assumed (3:ii) that the entire Beraisa discusses the same animal. This was wrong.) The Reisha discusses a Ba'al Mum, and the Seifa discusses a Tam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mesharshiya - Mishnah):</span> If the baby of a Kohen (Reuven) became mixed with the baby of his slave, when the children grow up, each gives a document of freedom to the other (after Reuven dies);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Before freeing each other,) both may eat Terumah. Together they receive one portion of Terumah at the granaries;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a (Tahor) Bechor is born to one of them, it is left to graze. He eats it after it gets a Mum.</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is nowadays.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Nowadays, there is no difference between their Bechoros and anyone else's. All are eaten after they get a Mum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be when the Mikdash stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand this if a Kohen acquires a (live) Tam Bechor. (He may keep it until it gets a Mum);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, if a Kohen does not acquire it (until it is slaughtered), the Gizbar should take it from him to offer it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, the Mishnah applies nowadays;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Yisrael must give his Bechor to a Kohen. Here, each of them can keep it, for he is a Safek Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> At what time does the Mishnah apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is nowadays.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Nowadays, there is no difference between their Bechoros and anyone else's. All are eaten after they get a Mum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be when the Mikdash stands!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Mishnah cannot discuss a Ba'al Mum, for it says that he keeps it until it gets a Mum. Rather, it discusses a Tam.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They cannot sell it, because each is a Safek Kohen, but a definite Kohen could sell it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, the Mishnah applies nowadays;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Yisrael must give his Bechor to a Kohen. Each Safek can keep it, for he tells the Kohen, you have no claim to it, (perhaps) I am a Kohen. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> "Behemtah" (of an Ir ha'Nidachas is killed) excludes Bechor and Ma'aser. "Shelalah" (its spoils) excludes money of Ma'aser Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When does this apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is nowadays.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> Ir ha'Nidachas applies only when there is a Great Sanhedrin of 71!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be when the Mikdash stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of animal is discussed?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It discusses a Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Ba'al Mum should be killed. It is "Behemtah" like any other animal of a resident of the city!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It discusses a Tam.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, if a Kohen acquires a Tam Bechor, we need a verse to teach that it is not killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>if a Kohen does not acquire it, we already know that it is not killed. We destroy only "Shelalah", but not Hash-m's belongings!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it discusses a Ba'al Mum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Behemtah" teaches only about animals that one may eat however he wants, but not a Ba'al Mum Bechor or Ma'aser:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Pesulei ha'Mukdashim may be slaughtered and sold in the meat market and weighed normally, except for Bechor and Ma'aser, for the money received for them belongs to the owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> "U'Ma'alah Ma'al ba'Shem" includes Kodshim Kalim, which are the property of the owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ben Azai says this includes Shelamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Aba Yosi ben Dostai says, Ben Azai did not say so. He includes only Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When does this apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is nowadays.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Beraisa discusses Shelamim. We are not Makdish Shelamim nowadays!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be when the Mikdash stands!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of Bechor is discussed?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It discusses a Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely, it is like Shelamim, i.e. (even) Tam! (Regarding Bechor, we could distinguish between Tam and Ba'al Mum. Kohanim receive a Tam from Hash-m's table only after offering the Eimurim, but they acquire a Ba'al Mum immediately. We cannot distinguish like this regarding Shelamim. Yisre'elim do not eat from Hash-m's table!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It discusses a Tam.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> This teaches that a Kohen acquires a Tam nowadays!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It discusses a Tam in Chutz la'Aretz (when the Mikdash stands). It is like R. Shimon, who says that (b'Di'eved) if a Tam was brought from Chutz la'Aretz, it is offered. (L'Chatchilah, he should not offer it. Rather, he should wait for it to get a Mum, and eat it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> We cannot learn from Chatas and Asham. Kohanim cannot make Temurah from them, because they acquire them only after Hakravah, but they acquire Bechor while it is alive!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of Bechor is discussed?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It discusses a Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely, it is like Chatas and Asham! (They are Tamim, for it says that they are acquired only after Hakravah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It discusses a Tam.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> It says that a Kohen acquires it while it is alive!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> It discusses a Tam in Chutz la'Aretz. It is like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about Rav Nachman's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Beraisa):</span> A Bechor can make Temurah in the owner's Reshus, but not in the Kohen's Reshus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, once the Kohen receives it, it does not make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is just like the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The first Tana means that in the Kohen's Reshus only the Kohen can make Temurah, but not the (original) owner. (R. Shimon holds that even the Kohen cannot make Temurah. They argue about whether or not the Kohen acquires it!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa):</span> A Bechor in the Kohen's Reshus cannot make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It cannot make Temurah, but the Kohen can sell it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, once the Kohen receives it, neither can make Temurah. (I.e. the Kohen cannot even sell it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about Rav Nachman's law. R. Shimon holds like Rav Nachman, and the first Tana does not. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they argue like R. Yochanan ben Nuri and R. Akiva in our Mishnah (like we established above, about a Tam in Chutz la'Aretz. All agree that it should not be offered, for it is the Kohen's property. The first Tana holds like R. Yochanan, who says that the Kohen can make Temurah. R. Shimon ben Elazar holds like R. Akiva, who says that he cannot.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SELLING A <i>BECHOR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A Kohen may sell a Tam Bechor to a Kohen, but not to a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We are concerned lest the Yisrael blemish it and tell the Chacham (who inspects the Mum) that he received it blemished from a Kohen. (This concern does not apply when selling to a Kohen. If a Kohen says that a Mum (that could be inflicted by man) happened by itself, he must bring witnesses.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Chacham would not permit this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We do not permit a Bechor to a Yisrael unless a Kohen is with him (lest the Yisrael keep the Bechor for himself)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> This is forbidden because it resembles a Kohen helping in the granary (in order to receive Terumah. Here also, it looks like the Kohen sells it cheaply to encourage the Yisrael to give future Bechoros to him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Mar Zutra visited Rav Ashi's house. They offered a Bechor to him, for it is healthy to eat it. They said that they had bought it from a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Mar Zutra:</span> Rav Huna forbids this, because it resembles a Kohen helping in the granary!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi's household:</span> We disagree with Rav Huna.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra - Mishnah) Question:</span> How long must a Yisrael take care of a Bechor before giving it to a Kohen?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He must take care of a Seh for 30 days, and a calf for 50 days...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Kohen asked for the Bechor within this time, the Yisrael may not give it (until the proper time).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> This is because it looks like a Kohen helping in the granary. (He saves the Yisrael the exertion of caring for the animal (for the proper amount of time), in order to receive it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav Ashi's household):</span> There, the Kohen clearly helps the Yisrael. Here, we bought the Bechor. (It does not look like he helps us.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rav Ashi's household):</span> There, the Yisrael did not pay money. Here, we paid money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Kohen sells it cheaply to encourage the Yisrael to give future Bechoros to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Kohen would rather receive the full value (of this Bechor) now, rather than to sell for less in hope of receiving future Bechoros.</p>
