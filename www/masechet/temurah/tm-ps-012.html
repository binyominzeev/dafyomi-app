<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(If one slaughters a pregnant animal, the fetus is permitted as if it itself was slaughtered.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If one said "this animal is a Shelamim and its fetus is Chulin" and he slaughtered it inside (the Mikdash), is he liable for (slaughtering) Chulin in the Azarah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The question (Rashi, according to R. Rensburg - is according to everyone if the mother was pregnant when he was Makdish it; additionally, if it became pregnant later, it) is according to the opinion that Vlados Kodshim become Kodesh when they are born.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> No. "Ki Yirchak Mimcha ha'Makom", which forbids Chulin b'Azarah, does not apply (since one may not slaughter it outside the Mikdash).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If one said "This animal is Chulin and its fetus is a Shelamim" and he slaughtered it outside, is he liable for Shechutei Chutz?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> No - "ve'Hevi'um la'Shem", which forbids Shechutei Chutz, does not apply (since one may not slaughter it inside).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> No. One is liable for Shechutei Chutz only for something that may be slaughtered in the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS THAT ARE ACCORDING TO THE PROPORTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Dimu'a (a mixture of Terumah and Chulin) became mixed with Chulin, it is Medame'a (forbids the mixture to Zarim or Teme'im, as if it was Terumah) according to the amount of Terumah it contains (i.e. only if there is less than 100 times as much Chulin as Terumah. We assume that the Terumah and Chulin mixed uniformly.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a dough fermented with Se'or (sourdough) of Terumah (Rashi; Tosfos - if Se'or of Chulin and Se'or of Terumah) fell into a Chulin dough and fermented it, it forbids the Chulin, according to the amount of Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Mayim She'uvim (water that was in a Kli) fell into an (incomplete) Mikveh, it forbids it according to the amount (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Mei Chatas cannot be Metaher until the ashes are put (on it);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A Beis ha'Pras (a field in which a Mes was plowed; mid'Rabanan it is Tamei, lest the plow dragged bones) does not make a Beis ha'Pras (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>(More) Terumah cannot be taken (from the remaining Chulin) after Terumah was taken;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>(An animal that became Kodesh through) Temurah or Vlados Kodshim cannot make Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yehudah says, Vlados Kodshim make Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> (Initial) Hekdesh makes Temurah. Vlados Kodshim do not make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It is unlike R. Eliezer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If one Se'ah of Terumah fell into less than 100 Se'ah of Chulin, and some of the Dimu'a fell into other Chulin, it forbids it as if it was pure Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, it forbids only according to the amount of Terumah it contains.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a dough fermented by (Tosfos - if Se'or of Chulin and) Se'or of Terumah fell into Chulin and fermented it, it forbids the Chulin, according to the amount of Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Eliezer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If Se'or of Chulin and of Terumah fell into a (Chulin) dough, and there was not enough of either one to ferment the dough, and together they fermented it, the dough is like the last one that fell in. (If it was Terumah, only Kohanim may eat it, in Taharah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, no matter which fell in last, it is forbidden (like Terumah) only if there was enough (Se'or of) Terumah to ferment it without the Chulin. (There, Abaye explains that (even when the Chulin fell in last,) R. Eliezer permits only if the Terumah was removed before the Chulin fell in. If not, it is forbidden. R. Eliezer forbids Zeh v'Zeh Gorem, and Chachamim permit.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN <i>MAYIM SHE'UVIM</i> INVALIDATE A <i>MIKVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mayim She'uvim forbid according to the amount...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It is R. Eliezer ben Yakov:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> If there are 21 Sa'im of rainwater in a Mikveh, one may pour 19 Se'ah into a furrow so they will fall in, and the Mikveh is Kosher;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is because Mayim She'uvim can become Kosher for a Mikveh through [being mixed with] a majority [of Kosher water] and Hamshachah (flowing on the ground).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Chachamim hold that a majority and Hamshachah do not help!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Ravin taught that if a Mikveh was made entirely from Mayim She'uvim through Hamshachah, it is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not like Chachamim, nor like R. Eliezer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> The Mishnah means that Mayim She'uvim forbid according to the number of Kelim. It is like Yosef ben Choni:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Yosef ben Choni):</span> If three Lugim were poured into a Mikveh from at most three Kelim, they disqualify the Mikveh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they came from four or more Kelim, they do not disqualify it (for less than one Log fell from each Kli).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MAKING <i>MEI CHATAS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mei Chatas are not Metaher until the ashes are put.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It is unlike R. Shimon. (Rashi explains that the following Beraisa refers to Mei Sotah. Sefas Emes brings evidence that it refers to Mei Chatas.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If earth (or ashes) was (were) put in the Kli before the water, it is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon is Machshir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Shimon) Question:</span> Why does it say "v'Lakchu la'Tamei me'<i>Afar</i> Serefas ha'Chatas"? We put <i>ashes</i> of the Parah Adumah in the water, and not earth!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Afar" instead of "Efer" in order to make a Gezeirah Shavah to Sotah. There it says "Afar";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Just like there, the earth should be put on the water, also here;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Just like here, if the earth was put before the water, it is Kosher, also there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that (here) if the ashes were put before the water, it is Kosher?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer - contradiction:</span> It says "v'Nasan Alav" (implying that the water is last), and it says "Mayim Chayim El Kli" (implying the water precedes the ashes)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Either of them may be first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does our Tana disqualify if the ashes were put first?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa (end of the verse), "Mayim Chayim El Kli", must be fulfilled (literally);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Reisha, "v'Nasan Alav," teaches that the ashes must be mixed with the water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should fulfill the Reisha (literally)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We always find that the Machshir is on top (e.g. regarding Sotah, the earth. Here, the ashes are Machshir.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>BEIS HA'PRAS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Beis ha'Pras does not make a Beis ha'Pras.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Our Mishnah is unlike R. Eliezer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> A Beis ha'Pras makes a Beis ha'Pras (Rashi - in all four directions; Tosfos - in whichever direction it was plowed, without limit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to Chachamim,) how far does Beis ha'Pras extend? (In the text of Shitah Mekubetzes, Chachamim explicitly said that Beis ha'Pras does not make Beis ha'Pras. The question is according to R. Eliezer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> Three fields become Beis ha'Pras (the field in which the Mes was lost, and the adjacent fields in the two directions in which the field is normally plowed, north-south or east-west). The adjacent fields become Beis ha'Pras, until the (standard) length of a furrow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A furrow is 100 Amos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a grave was plowed, it makes a Beis ha'Pras up to the length of a furrow, 100 Amos.</p>
