<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH <i>TEMUROS</i> AND <i>VLADOS</i> ARE OFFERED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa needs "Rak" to teach that we do not offer Vlados of all Korbanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Vlados of which Korban are not offered?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It need not teach about Olah. It is male!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It need not teach about Chatas. A tradition teaches that Vlados must die! <span class="note">(<span class="notewd">Note:</span> the tradition teaches only about four of the five that must die. However, we were unsure about for which there was a tradition. I.e. we cannot derive from the Beraisa that there is no tradition about Vlad Chatas! R. Noson holds that the tradition teaches only about one of them. In any case, the Gemara must answer for Reish Lakish, who holds that the tradition is for four of them.)</span></p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it teaches about (Shitah - Vlados of Temuras) Asham!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Tradition teaches that in every case that a Chatas must die, the corresponding case of Asham is Ro'eh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Really, it teaches about Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The tradition teaches that it must die. The verse teaches that it may not be offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously, if it must die it may not be offered!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It teaches that Temuras Asham may not be offered;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Tradition teaches that it must Ro'eh, i.e. it itself cannot be offered!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Defense of both answers:</span> The verse teaches that if one offers it, he transgresses an Aseh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> We need not learn from there. "Asham Hu" teaches that it is offered, but its Temurah is not offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he need a verse? Tradition teaches that in every case that a Chatas must die, the corresponding case of Asham is Ro'eh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the verse really teaches Rav Huna's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If an Asham (that cannot be offered, e.g. she'Kipru Ba'aleha) was Nitak (given to a shepherd) to be Ro'eh, and was slaughtered Stam (without special intention), it is (an Olah, it is) valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Before Nituk, it may not be slaughtered! (R. Tam deletes this from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> "Hu" - it is in its original status (Asham, until Nituk. An unneeded Asham is Pasul).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Tam):</span> Answer: "Hu" - it is (immediately) in its (ultimate) status (an Olah, mid'Oraisa. Mid'Rabanan, we do not offer it itself. Rather it is Ro'eh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yishmael learns about Temuros and Vlados from "Rak Kodoshecha... " What does he learn from "Im Zachar Im Nekevah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns about Temuros and Vlados of Ba'alei Mumim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he expounds it (like Beraisa #1, 17b), he should learn from it Temuros and Vlados of Tamim and Ba'alei Mumim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does not expound "Im," rather only "Zachar" and "Nekevah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the Tana of Beraisa #1 expound "Tisa u'Vasa"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> It teaches that one must bring them even mi'Mir'aihu. (Rashi - they are in the pasture and it is an exertion to get them. Tosfos - they are in Chutz la'Aretz, where one may graze them, but Chachamim decreed not to raise animals in Eretz Yisrael.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer:</span> It teaches that one must bring them even mi'Mor'gaihu. (R. Gershom - on its own, the Korban was threshing; Rashi - it was a Chulin animal that you planned to be Makdish and bring for a Korban, and it is threshing when you are about to go to the Mikdash for the festival; Tosfos - it is thin now.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OFFERING VLADOS SHELAMIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> Vlad Shelamim may not be offered for Shelamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, it is offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> They do not argue about Vladei Vlados Shelamim or (Vladei - Shitah deletes this from the text) Vlados Temurah, that they are not offered;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about Vlad Shelamim. R. Eliezer says that it is not offered, and Chachamim say that it is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehoshua and R. Papeyas testified that a Vlad Shelamim is offered for a Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Papeyas testified '(in my family) we offered a Shelamim on Pesach, and offered its Vlad for a Shelamim on Chag (Sukos).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Ami) Question:</span> What is R. Eliezer's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ami):</span> We read "<i>v'Im</i> Zevach Shelamim Korbano" like "v'Em" (the mother is offered), but not the Vlad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If so, he should expound similarly "Im Al Todah" - "Em," and not the Vlad!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he does!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that Vlad, Temuras and Chalifas (an animal brought to replace a) Todah may be offered?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Im Al Todah." (R. Eliezer does not argue with this!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Rather, he decrees to forbid offering the Vlad, lest people delay bringing Shelamim in order to raise flocks of Shelamim. (Todah is not common, so he does not decree about it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> They do not argue...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Shimon mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he mean "they do not argue (about Vladei Vlados, that anyone holds) that they are not offered. Rather, all agree that they are offered";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or does he mean "they do not argue (i.e. no one holds) that they are offered. Rather, all agree that they are not offered"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> Presumably, he means that all agree that they are offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about the Vlad, for it is common. It is rare that Vladei Vlados would be born. (normally, the Vlad is offered before it is old enough to bear offspring), so no one decrees about them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> He holds that all agree that they are not offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim permit the Vlad only because it is not clear that he intended to raise flocks of Shelamim. If a second generation is born, it becomes clear that he intended to raise flocks.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yehoshua ben Levi - Rav Chananya - Beraisa):</span> "Im Kesev <i>Hu</i> Makriv" teaches that the first Vlad is offered, but not the second (generation) Vlad;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Hu" (Vlad Shelamim) is offered, but not Vlados of all Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Vlados of which Korban are not offered?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It need not teach about Olah or Asham. They are males!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It need not teach about Chatas. A tradition teaches that Vlados must die!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> It teaches about Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need a verse for Ma'aser? We should learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Avarah-Avarah" from Bechor (we never find Vlados Bechor offered, for it is male. Likewise, Vlados Ma'aser are not offered!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need the verse, for one might have thought we do not learn Efshar (possible, i.e. Vlad Ma'aser) from Iy Efshar (Vlad Bechor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Papeyas):</span> (We offered a Shelamim on Pesach, and its Vlad on Chag.).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rava, who says that one who does not bring a Korban on the first possible festival transgresses every day, they should have brought it on Shavu'os!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zevid citing Rava):</span> The case is, it was sick on Shavu'os. (Therefore it was permitted to delay until Sukos);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> (Indeed, they offered it on Shavu'os.) Here, "Chag" refers to Shavu'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Zevid disagrees. If the Tana called Pesach "Pesach," he would call Shavu'os "Atzeres," and not "Chag."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so (Rashi - according to both of them), what do we learn from his testimony?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is unlike R. Eliezer, who forbids offering Vlad Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>VLAD TODAH AND TEMURAS TODAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Vlad or Temurah of Todah, and their Vlados, and their Vlados for all generations are like Todah, except that they are offered without bread (Lachmei Todah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this? (Vayikra 7:12 says "Im Al Todah Yakrivenu v'Hikriv Al Zevach Todah.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Yakrivenu"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> If one was Makdish a Todah, and it was lost, and another was Hukdash in its place, and the first was found, what is the source that one may offer either?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Todah Yakriv". (This is not an exact quote. "Yakrivenu" is unnecessary, we first expound the root, and later the suffix).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps when we offer the second, women bring bread with it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yakrivenu" (singular) alludes to one, and not two.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include (offering) Vlad and Temuras Todah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Its "Im Al Todah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps all of them require bread!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Al Zevach Todah" teaches that only Todah requires bread, but not its Vlad, Temurah or Chalifah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Temuras Olah, and its Vlados and Vladei Vlados for all generations are like Olah. They require Hefshet and Nitu'ach, and they are Kalil (entirely burned on the Mizbe'ach);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If one was Makdish a female for an Olah and it gave birth to a male, the Vlad is Ro'eh. We offer an Olah with its Damim (redemption money. Every mention of a female or Vlad Olah (or Asham or Pesach) refers to such a case. We adopt the text of Shitah Mekubetzes, who changes many occurrences of "R. Eliezer" to "R. Elazar" - see Background to the Daf.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Elazar says, it itself is offered for an Olah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why do Chachamim argue in the Seifa, but not in the Reisha?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Indeed, Chachamim argue also in the Reisha. (The Mishnah gives only R. Elazar's opinion);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Chachamim agree in the Reisha;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue only in the Seifa, regarding the Vlad Olah, because its "Em" (the initial Hekdesh from which it comes) was unable to be offered;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They agree that Temurah and its Vlados are offered, because their "Em," a (male) Olah, could have been offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Elazar really hold that we offer Temuras Olah and its Vlados?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> Temuras Asham, and its Vlados and Vladei Vlados for all generations are Ro'eh. We bring Nedavah (Olos Tzibur) with the Damim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer says, they must die;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar says, the owner brings Olos with their Damim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> R. Elazar does not permit offering the Temurah and Vlados themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> R. Elazar addresses Chachamim according to their reasoning:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I hold that even Vlad Asham is offered for an Olah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>You hold that it is Ro'eh. You should say that the owner (and not the Tzibur) brings an Olah with the Damim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No, Mosar Asham is for Nidvos Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> R. Elazar says that Vlad Olah is itself offered for an Olah, because Shem Olah Al Imo (it is the same Kedushah as its "Em"; Rashi - alternatively, because Kedushas Olah applies to female birds);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Vlad Asham is not offered for an Olah, for Ein Shem Olah Al Imo (its Em was an Asham. Alternatively, Kedushas Asham never applies to females), so it is Ro'eh.</p>
