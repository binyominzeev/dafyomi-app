<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Presumably, then, R. Yehudah is not lenient regarding salt in the dough.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we learned that R. Yehudah groups water and salt together as being Beteilim both in a dough and in a cooked dish!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa refers to (the very fine) Sedomis salt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find that R. Yehudah differentiates between a dough (where water and salt are Batel) and a cooked dish (where water is <i>not</i> Batel)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The latter Beraisa speaks of a more liquid dish, whereas the former Beraisa speaks of a dish where the liquid is not noticeable.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: FLAMES AND COALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A coal is restricted by the Techum of its owner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A flame is not restricted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A coal of Hekdesh carries the penalties of Me'ilah, while a flame (though one may not derive benefit from it) would not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>One would be Chayav for transporting a coal, but not a flame.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A LENIENCY REGARDING AVODAH ZARAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Five distinctions are taught between a coal and a flame.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the flame of Avodah Zarah permitted, while Chazal forbade the flame of Hekdesh!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There was no need to intervene and prohibit that which is disgusting.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TRANSPORTING A FLAME IS PATUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But a Beraisa states that one is Chayav!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Sheshes):</span> One is Chayav if he transports the flame on a splinter of wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the <i>splinter</i> should be the cause of his Chiyuv!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The splinter is too small for Chiyuv on its own (as established in the cited Mishnah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He is Chayav when he rubs oil on a Kli and carries it aflame.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the Kli should cause his Chiyuv!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are speaking of a pottery-shard.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should be Chayav for the shard!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is less than the Shiyur (as taught).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How, practically, could one transport a flame without it being attached to anything!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He cast an unattached flame into the street.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH: WATER IN ITS CISTERNS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Water in a private well is restricted by the Techum of its owner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Water in a communal well has the restrictions of the residents of that city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Water in a well of Olei Bavel has the restriction of whomever draws it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>WATER HAS THE SHEVISAH OF ITS OWNER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava of R. Nachman):</span> But we find that water does not acquire Shevisah at all!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> That speaks of moving water (no Shevisah) while our Mishnah speaks of collected, standing water (has Shevisah) as cited in the name of Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>WATER DRAWN ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman):</span> Such water has the Techum of the intended beneficiary.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Sheshes):</span> It is restricted by the Techum on the one who drew it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the basis of their argument?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Whether we view the water as Hefker, and may not be claimed by one on behalf of another (R. Sheshes) or is it jointly owned and may be drawn for another using Bereirah (R. Nachman).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava of R. Nachman):</span> We see that these cisterns could not be viewed as jointly owned, or those who had taken oaths not to benefit from one another could not draw from the wells of Olei Bavel (yet we are taught that they would be so permitted while the Mishnah teaches that they could not bathe in one- another's well)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, they would be prohibited to bathe in the wells of Olei Bavel, and the permission to draw water from them is because of Bereirah (each is drawing that which turns out to have been his own).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Nachman holds <i>Ein Bereirah</i>!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is evidenced by his ruling that even if the brothers divided the inheritance sheep for sheep (not one type of animal against another) they are viewed as buyers and not as inheritors.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they later rejoin they would be obligated for the Kalbon and exempt from Ma'aser Beheimah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they are arguing whether one acquires for himself a Metziah which he attempted to (but cannot) acquire on behalf of another (R. Sheshes) or whether he cannot since he never intended himself as an owner (R. Nachman).</p></div>
