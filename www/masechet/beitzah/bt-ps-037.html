<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>RATIONALE FOR THE PROHIBITIONS (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chalitzah and Yibum should be categorized as a Mitzvah, not a Reshus!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are speaking where there is an older brother.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why, indeed, are all of the above not permitted?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Lest one come to write.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Making something Hekdesh is prohibited owing to its similarity to a business transaction.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE PROHIBITION OF SEPARATING TERUMOS AND MA'ASEROS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this prohibition not obvious?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have permitted it when one intends to give them to the Kohen that day (which is indeed the case when the produce became Tevel on Shabbos or Yom Tov, not the day before).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SEPARATE CATEGORIES OF SHEVUS, RESHUS AND MITZVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reshus activities (once prohibited) are Shevus prohibitions, as are the Mitzvah activities!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana is building the statement of prohibition from the obvious (Shevus) to even Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE PROHIBITIONS OF SHABBOS ARE IDENTICAL TO YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah (speaking of lowering fruit via a skylight) permits on Yom Tov but not on Shabbos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> The Mishnah of Mashilin is the view of R. Yehoshua (who permits, on Yom Tov, bringing up both animals with a Ha'aramah) whereas our Mishnah is the view of R. Eliezer (who does not permit bringing up the second animal, which may not be slaughtered on that day)) [see explanations for the relationship between this Machlokes and the distinction between Shabbos and Yom Tov].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Perhaps even R. Eliezer would permit the Ha'aramah if there were no way to sustain the other animal in the pit, or R. Yehoshua would prohibit if there were no reasonable Ha'aramah (as in our Mishnah where all would prohibit)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> Our Mishnah (prohibiting lowering through the skylight even on Yom Tov) is actually the view of Beis Shamai (who prohibit carrying items not needed for Ochel Nefesh on Yom Tov) while the previous Mishnah is Beis Hillel (who permits such carrying, and the associated Muktzah, making Yom Tov more lenient than Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Beis Shamai are only strict when it comes to carrying on Yom Tov (but not by Mashilin, which is only a matter of Tiltul)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tiltul itself is prohibited because one may come to carry (so that the stringency of carrying will always be associated with an Isur Tiltul).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH: TECHUM SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Animals and vessels share the same Techum as their owners and handing them to another (on Yom Tov) will not alter their Techum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Articles associated with one (inheriting) brother bear his Techum while those not specifically associated with one brother are restricted to the common Techum of all the brothers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If someone borrows a vessel before Yom Tov, its Techum is that of the borrower; whereas if he borrowed it on Yom Tov, then its Techum remains that of the lender.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If one woman borrows spices, water or salt from another on Yom Tov the cooked dish will be restricted to the common Techum of both women.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> We discount the water since it is not noticeable in the cooked dish.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE EFFECT OF ONE'S INTENT ON TECHUM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah appears to disagree with R. Dosa (or Aba Shaul) who allows the Techum of an article to follow the recipient even if received on Yom Tov!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah speaks in a town where there are two shepherds (and thus his intent is not obvious before Yom Tov), as indicated by the options 'shepherd or son' mentioned in the Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows R. Dosa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yochanan ruled that the Halachah follows a Stam Mishnah (which states that the Techum follows the owner unless it was transferred before Yom Tov)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This has already been addressed above (by differentiating between one shepherd and two).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>COMMON TECHUM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A coat which two people borrowed on Erev Yom Tov is restricted to the Techum which is common to both of them (with the given illustrations).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If two people jointly purchased a barrel of wine on Erev Yom Tov each one may take his share of the wine to his Techum (Yesh Bereirah) while a jointly purchased animal would be restricted to the common Techum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The barrel is also restricted to their common Techum (Ein Bereirah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav seems inconsistent to either position regarding Bereirah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds Yesh Bereirah but the animal is one unit (each portion in the animal is nourished by the other) and is thus restricted to the common Techum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Question (R. Kahana and R. Asi) If this 'oneness' does not create an Isur Muktzah then it should not either create the Isur of Techumin!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> No answer (see Rif and Meiri for various interpretations of Rav's silence).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What, in the end, is the decision?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Hoshaya holds Yesh Bereirah; R. Yochanan holds Ein Bereirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find that R. Hoshaya holds <i>Ein</i> Bereirah (since he explains Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai in Ohalos as speaking from this point forward, but one's thoughts will not retroactively select the opening)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Switch the opinions of R. Hoshaya and R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we can show that R. Yochanan does <i>not</i> hold of Bereirah (the divided properties are not viewed as retroactively divided)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan would allow Bereirah in a d'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we see (from his position regarding conditional Eruvei Techumin) that R. Yochanan does not hold of Bereirah even in a d'Rabanan!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, do not switch their positions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then what of R. Hoshaya?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does not hold of Bereirah for a d'Oraisa, but he allows Bereirah in a d'Rabanan (e.g. Techumin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> The Halachah follows R. Hoshaya.</p></div>
