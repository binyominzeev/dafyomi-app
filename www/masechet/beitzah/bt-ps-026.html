<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: CHECKING THE BLEMISH OF A BECHOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(R. Yehudah) An expert may descend to the pit to check the Mum of a Bechor and, only if its Mum is permanent, the animal may be raised up and slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>(R. Shimon) If a Mum was not evident before Yom Tov the animal is not Muchan, and should not be permitted by an expert.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE NATURE OF THIS MACHLOKES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is their Machlokes?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Whether (R. Yehudah) or not (R. Shimon) one may check Mumin on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then why does the Mishnah introduce the fact that the Bechor had fallen into a pit?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have permitted a Ha'aramah (akin to that used by R. Yehoshua for raising up an animal and its young) given the Tza'ar of the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the Mishnah should have taught that the animal may not be <i>raised up</i> and slaughtered (not simply that it may not be slaughtered, as we have it)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need this wording to prohibit slaughtering the animal in the case where the person (without permission) has already raised it from the pit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who would have thought to permit slaughtering an unblemished Bechor!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are speaking (and prohibiting slaughtering) in the case where the Bechor, after being raised up, developed a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But such an animal would be Muktzah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it had a passing Mum from before Yom Tov and contracted a permanent Mum on Yom Tov (which we might have permitted since he has some Da'as on this animal).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ANOTHER BERAISA REGARDING BECHOR ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(Rebbi) An expert may descend and permit the animal to be raised and slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the owner raised the animal without permission it may not be slaughtered on Yom Tov (even with a Mum).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>(R. Shimon b. Menasia) We must be stringent (and not permit the expert to check the animal) given the disputes of the early Tanaim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may not check Mumin on Yom Tov (that is, the expert should not go to see a Mum which was present from before Yom Tov, but he may permit the animal if he should pass it and see its Mum).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> If the Mum appears on Yom Tov, then no steps to permit it may be taken, since it is not Muchan (and such a ruling would constitute Mesaken).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah and R. Shimon (who argue regarding Muktzah) would agree that if the animal was born with its Mum (the experts were present at its birth) that it is Muchan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE AMORA'IM DISCUSS THE BECHOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar R. Huna):</span> A Bechor born with its Mum may be purposely checked on Yom Tov (L'chatchilah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman):</span> My father taught that it may only be ruled upon if the expert happens to see the animal (b'Di'eved).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The manner in which the teaching of R. Shimon b. Menasia was divided into three parts (in the Beraisa above) indicates, like Rabah bar R. Huna, that the permission is even L'chatchilah (since if it were only b'Di'eved, part three [it was born with its Mum] could have been taught together with the first part [a Mum was present from before Yom Tov]).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Oshia came with a rendition of that Beraisa which does not separate between the first and second parts [it prohibits, even b'Di'eved, whether the Mum preceded Yom Tov or was developed on Yom Tov] and the third part only permits b'Di'eved!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should you rely moreso on the Beraisa brought by R. Oshia than the one which Abaye cited in support of Rabah bar R. Huna!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because the Beraisa cited by Abaye is unreliable, given its source.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman b. Yitzchak):</span> Our Mishnah further supports the Beraisa as brought by R. Oshia.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon made reference to its Mum not being recognizable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This could not mean that it was entirely unrecognizable, since that would be obvious.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It must mean that it was present before Yom Tov but not yet shown to an expert.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Still, R. Shimon asserts (to R. Yehudah) that it is not Muchan (hence he must prohibit even b'Di'eved).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MUKTZAH FOR A PART OF SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May something be Muktzah for part of Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The deciding time is Bein ha'shemashos, and there should be no question about a part of Shabbos, either it was available during that time (and not Muktzah for Shabbos) or it was not)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The question looks at a case where it was Muchan, lost its status and then regained it during Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Muktzah from that part of Shabbos onward.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that it is not Muktzah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An animal born with a Mum is Muchan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It should be viewed having gone through a period of unavailability (after its birth but prior to having been ruled upon by the expert).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The expert saw it as it was born, so that it never had the prohibited status of a Bechor Tam.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Alternate rendition of the above three steps:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not Muktzah for the part of Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the Beraisa a support for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Not necessarily, since the expert was there at the time of birth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa which prohibits one from eating the fruits which he placed on his roof to dry, unless there was Hazmanah, proves that there is no Muktzah for a part of Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they were edible with the entrance of Shabbos, why does he require Hazmanah (and if it were inedible then, how would Hazmanah help)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not know whether they were edible.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we were taught that such fruit, if they were dry, even if the owner was unaware, is not Muktzah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must speak where they were dry, became moist (and inedible) and re-dried (and only with prior Hazmanah would they be Mutar).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there were no Muktzah for a part of Shabbos, of what need would there be for Hazmanah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That question is not made any easier if you hold that there <i>is</i> Muktzah for a part of Shabbos, since Hazmanah should be meaningless!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa (has no bearing on Muktzah l'Chatzi Shabbos and it) requires Hazmanah to declare their readiness since the raisins were edible for some and not for others.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> We may demonstrate that there is no Muktzah for a part of Shabbos from the case of lentils (which become inedible at the start of the cooking process, even though they could be eaten prior to, and after, the cooking on Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> That reasoning should hold true for every cooked pot since it is too hot to be eaten when Shabbos begins (and the deciding factor must be that which becomes unusable beyond the person's control)!?</p></div>
