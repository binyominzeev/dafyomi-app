<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>BURIALS ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who died on the first day of Yom Tov should be buried by gentiles but if he died on the second day of Yom Tov he should be buried by Jews.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>These rules apply also the two days of Rosh Hashanah, but the rules regarding an egg laid are different (on the second day of Yom Tov it is permitted but on second day Rosh Hashanah, it is prohibited).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Neharda'ei):</span> The rules for eggs are the same (an egg laid on the first day of Rosh Hashanah is permitted on the second day).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would you have thought that it is prohibited?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because perhaps Elul was made a full month (with 30 days, thus making the two days of Rosh Hashanah as Kedushah Achas).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This need not be a concern since from the time of Ezra, Elul was never made a full month, and therefore the two days of Rosh Hashanah are two separate Kedushos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> Rava's permission for Jews to do the burial on the second day applies only to a corpse lying from the first day, but if the person had died on the second day we postpone the burial (until after Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> Rava's permission applies even to a death on the second day (see Rosh and Rashi for the application of the Machlokes).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the leniency exist?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because with respect to a corpse, Chazal made the second day of Yom Tov like a weekday (it is even permitted to prepare and tear garments for the corpse and to cut a myrtle branch for it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Now that there are "Chavri," we do not do burials on the second day of Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MAKING AN ERUV TAVSHILIN ON THE FIRST DAY OF ROSH HASHANAH FOR THE SECOND DAY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Ravina saw that R. Ashi was sad on the first day of Rosh Hashanah, and he asked him about it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Ashi responded that he had not made an Eruv Tavshilin before Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Then make it now, on the first day of Rosh Hashanah (given Rava's ruling that one may make an Eruv Tavshilin on the first day of Yom Tov for use on the second day [Chutz la'Aretz-Ma Nafshach])!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> That applies only to two days of Yom Tov Shel Galus; it does not apply to the two days of Rosh Hashanah (Kedushah Achas).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> But Neharda'ei said that an egg laid on first day of Rosh Hashanah is permitted on the second day (which proves that they are two Kedushos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Mordechai):</span> R. Ashi does not agree with Neharda'ei.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A CHICK THAT EMERGED FROM ITS EGG ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A chick born on Yom Tov is prohibited.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel, or R. Yochanan):</span> It is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rav prohibits it because it is Muktzah while Shmuel (or R. Yochanan) permits it because of "Ho'il" (since the chick, by being born, becomes permitted to eat through Shechitah, it also becomes permitted with regard to Muktzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav, why does a chick differ from a calf born on Yom Tov (which is permitted)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> A calf was Muchan because of its mother which can be slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does a chick differ from a calf born from a Tereifah on Yom Tov (which is permitted)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Rav was silent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rav not answer that a calf born from a Tereifah is Muchan because of its mother which can be fed to dogs?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> If something which is Muchan for man is not considered Muchan for dogs (as Abaye proves from a Mishnah), then something which is Muchan for dogs cannot be considered Muchan for man.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav still should have given this answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Something which is Muchan for dogs is also Muchan for man, because man has his mind on everything which may be fit for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Something which is Muchan for man is not Muchan for dogs, because man does not give to dogs what is fit for use for himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Hence, Rav should have given this answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>A Beraisa supports each, Rav and Shmuel (or R. Yochanan).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Beraisa supports Rav, saying that a calf born on Yom Tov is permitted, while a chick born on Yom Tov is prohibited, the difference being that the calf was Muchan because of its mother which can be slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Beraisa supports Shmuel (or R. Yochanan), saying that both a calf and a chick born on Yom Tov are permitted, the reasons being that the calf is Muchan because of its mother, and the chick permits itself to be eaten by Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ANOTHER ARGUMENT CONCERNING A CHICK BORN ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> A chick born on Yom Tov is prohibited.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer b. Yakov):</span> Even when it is born on a weekday, it is prohibited, because it has not yet opened its eyes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A Beraisa was taught in accordance with R. Eliezer b. Yakov's opinion.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>A CRYPTIC STATEMENT ABOUT AN EGG</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna citing Rav):</span> An egg is completed upon its exit from the chicken.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that the egg may be eaten with milk upon its exit, but while it is inside the chicken it may not be eaten with milk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But a Beraisa states that whole eggs found within a slaughtered chicken may be eaten with milk!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that the egg may be eaten on Yom Tov if it exited before Yom Tov, but if it is inside the chicken at the onset of Yom Tov it may not be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But a Beraisa states that eggs found within a slaughtered chicken on Yom Tov may be eaten!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the Beraisa is teaching something that the Mishnah did not teach (Rashi: and thus the Beraisa is in error).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This was also taught in a Mishnah:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Beis Shamai says that an egg laid on Yom Tov may be eaten; Beis Hillel says that the egg may not be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The argument between Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel concerns only an egg that was laid; they both agree that an egg inside of the chicken is permitted (like the Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps Beis Hillel also prohibits an egg inside of the chicken, and the Mishnah expresses the argument with regard to an egg that was laid to teach us the extent of the Kula of Beis Shamai (and the Halachah of the Beraisa is not in the Mishnah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, then the Beraisa is in accordance with neither Beis Shamai nor Beis Hillel!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be that the argument concerns only an egg that was laid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the Beraisa is in accordance with Beis Hillel, and is not in error, and thus the Beraisa contradicts this interpretation of Rav Huna's statement!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, "an egg is completed upon its exit" and it will bear chicks, whereas an egg inside of the chicken cannot bear chicks.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Halachic difference does this make?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding a legal transaction, as in the following incident:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The buyer asked for eggs from a living chicken and the seller gave him eggs from a slaughtered chick.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Ami invalidated the sale.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But such a sale is obviously invalid!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have considered it only Ona'ah (which requires that the difference in price be returned) if we assume that the buyer wanted the eggs for eating and was only stating his preference, not making a condition of sale.</p></div>
