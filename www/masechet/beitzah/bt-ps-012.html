<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HOTZA'AH ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> One may not carry out to Reshus ha'Rabim that which is not needed for Ochel Nefesh on Yom Tov (e.g. a child, a Lulav, a Sefer Torah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> It is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MITOCH SHE'HUTRAH L'TZORECH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It was taught before R. Yitzchak b. Avdimi that one who slaughters an Olas Nedavah on Yom Tov incurs Malkos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak b. Avdimi):</span> The source of that teaching is Beis Shamai (who do not apply Mitoch to permit Melachah for non Ochel Nefesh purposes) and could not be Beis Hillel (who do make that extension).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> Perhaps our Mishnah deals with the issue of whether Eruv and Hotza'ah are relevant to Yom Tov (Beis Shamai) or not (Beis Hillel, inferring from the Pasuk which speaks only of Shabbos), while both would agree not to apply Mitoch!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> If Beis Hillel indeed hold that there is no Hotza'ah on Yom Tov, then they should have taught this regarding permitting stones (thus we may demonstrate that the argument is not over Hotza'ah itself, but over Hotza'ah she'Lo l'Tzorech)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>We may demonstrate that R. Yochanan also holds that the Machlokes is over Mitoch (and that all agree to the existence of Isur Hotz'ah on Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It was taught before R. Yochanan that one who cooks Gid ha'Nasheh in Milk and eats it on Yom Tov incurs five sets of Malkos (as listed).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yochanan rejected the inclusion of Hav'arah (which Mitoch should permit) unless the Mishnah were Beis Shamai (thus demonstrating his view that Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argue over Mitoch).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: TRANSPORTING THE PERMITTED HAFRASHOS TO THE KOHEN ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> One may not (give or) transport Chalah and Matanos (from an animal) to the Kohen on Yom Tov, regardless of whether the Hafrashah took place on or before Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> It is permitted to give and transport the Chalah and Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Beis Shamai adduces support from a Gezeirah Shavah (comparing Dinim d'Rabanan) linking Chalah and Matanos to Terumah (which, while taken before Yom Tov, may not be brought to the Kohen on Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Beis Hillel differentiate between Chalah and Matanos (which one is permitted to be Mafrish on Yom Tov and, by extension, to give and transport) and Terumah (which one is not permitted to be Mafrish on Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>UNDERSTANDING THE MACHLOKES BETWEEN BEIS HILLEL AND BEIS SHAMAI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We initially assume that the Machlokes holds regardless of when the Hafrashos took place (before or on Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so (that Beis Shamai forbids giving even Matanos which were Mufrash on Yom Tov) then our Mishnah follows the view of Acherim (and does not follow the opinions of R. Yosi nor R. Yehudah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Even Beis Shamai agree that Hafrashos from Yom Tov may be given.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Chalah and Matanos may be given regardless of when the Hafrashah took place (and the argument is only over Terumah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Acherim):</span> All agree that Terumah may not be given and the argument is only over the Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah could be R. Yehudah, and the Mishnah speaks only of Matanos whose <i>Hafrashah</i> was on Yom Tov (but which were slaughtered before Yom Tov)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Under that assumption, then the Mishnah is the view of R. Yehudah, and not Acherim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It may be the view of Acherim and Beis Shamai only prohibit giving the Matanos of animals slaughtered before Yom Tov (but Matanos of animals slaughtered on Yom Tov would be permitted to be brought to the Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the position of Acherim is identical with that of R. Yehudah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They would differ on whether it is permitted to add Matanos from an animal slaughtered before Yom Tov to the Matanos being brought from an animal slaughtered on Yom Tov (R. Yehudah) or not (Acherim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi (that even Terumah may be given on Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>When the question was brought before R. Yosef, he ruled in accordance with R. Yehudah citing Shmuel, like R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>CRACKING OPEN SHELLS OF SEEDS ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (the landlord):</span> Is it permitted to crack open mustard seeds and eat them on Yom Tov?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava bar R. Chanan):</span> He did not know the answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The question was brought to Rava, who ruled that one may roll ears of wheat, and crack kernels on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa contradicts this!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who rolls ears of wheat on Erev Shabbos, on Shabbos may blow them (to remove the chaff) from hand to hand and eat the kernels, but not in a Kinun nor in a Tamchuy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One who rolls ears of wheat before Yom Tov, may blow them on Yom Tov one by one and eat the kernels, even in a Kinun and a Tamchuy, but not in sifter or a sieve.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>On Erev Yom Tov one may roll ears of wheat, but not on Yom Tov itself!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is also permitted on Yom Tov (Erev Yom Tov is mentioned only to parallel the Reisha of the Beraisa which says Erev Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rava (who permits opening the chaff on Yom Tov in order to eat the kernel inside), the statement of our Mishnah is inaccurate.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Our Mishnah teaches that Terumah cannot be separated on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to Rava, Terumah can be separated on Yom Tov, for otherwise one would not be permitted to eat the kernel from which he removes the chaff (which Rava permits)!</p></div>
