<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>EXCEPTIONS FROM <i>SHATNEZ</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> Shoe soles are exempt from Shatnez (due to their hardness they do not warm the wearer).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Pouches for storing coins are exempt (they are stiffened by the friction with the coins) while pouches for storing seeds are liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> Both types of pouches are exempt since they do not warm the person in the normal manner.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SPIKED SANDAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this gift prohibited?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Owing to the tragic incident (Shabbos 60a).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> While they may not be worn on Yom Tov, they are not Muktzah (since otherwise the Mishnah would not need to teach that they cannot be sent).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE UNSTITCHED SHOE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this prohibition not obvious!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have permitted if the parts had been pinned together.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>AN UNPOLISHED SHOE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> A black shoe (even though it requires polishing to smooth it) is permitted while a white (yet undyed shoe) is prohibited.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> The black shoe is also prohibited owing to its need to be polished.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Each Tana is speaking with reference to the practice in his locale.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In R. Yehudah's locale the flesh-side of the hide is placed on the inside of the shoe (which then does not need to be polished).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In R. Yosi's locale the flesh-side was out and thus needed to be smoothed by polishing.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>TEFILIN AS AN APPLICATION OF THE GENERAL RULE FOR SENDING GIFTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Sheshes):</span> It is permitted to send Tefilin on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> But no benefit may be derived from them on Yom Tov (and thus they fail the general rule of the Mishnah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Sheshes):</span> The rule permits anything from which benefit may be derived, even on a weekday.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>WHILE ON THE SUBJECT OF TEFILIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One who is wearing Tefilin on his travels when the sun sets (on Erev Shabbos - Rashi, but see Tosfos) covers the Tefilin until he reaches his home.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Similarly, one who is in the Beis Medrash learning when Shabbos enters places his hand on his Tefilin until he gets to his home.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Huna brei d'Rav Ika):</span> But we were taught that in both cases he walks only to the nearest home!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa is speaking where the nearest home provides safety for the Tefilin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But if the Tefilin would not be safe then even if he were not wearing them he would be permitted to don them in order to bring them to safety on Shabbos (as in the Mishnah in Eruvin)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah permits donning them where their present location does not provide protection even from dogs, while Abaye is speaking where his present place is safe from dogs but not from thieves.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Whereas we might have assumed that Jewish thieves would not tamper with Tefilin (and thus they should be left in their place even if he is wearing them);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Abaye has taught that if he is wearing them, the concern for the abuse of thieves is sufficient to permit wearing them to safety (but not to put them on if he is not wearing them).</p></div>

<div class="perekline">PEREK YOM TOV</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>MISHNAH: ERUV TAVSHILIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may not cook on Yom Tov for Shabbos, but one may cook for Yom Tov and eat the leftovers on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>To cook expressly for Shabbos one must cook a food (as Eruv Tavshilin) before Yom Tov and rely on it to cook further on Yom Tov for Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> The Eruv requires two cooked foods.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> One food is sufficient.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A fish fried with egg qualifies as two foods.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One must not (continue to) cook if the Eruv were eaten or lost, unless a bit of the Eruv remains.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>THE BASIS FOR ERUV TAVSHILIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> On what basis did Chazal institute Eruv Tavshilin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> They used the word Zachor as a hint to remember that which we might forget (Shabbos, when Yom Tov precedes it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they institute Eruv Tavshilin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> To insure that a proper portion of food be readied for Shabbos (and not all used for Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> To remind the person that it is not permitted to cook on Yom Tov for a weekday (since even to cook for Shabbos requires an Eruv).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why, according to Rava's reasoning, must the Eruv be prepared before Yom Tov (it should be made whenever the Yom Tov meal is being prepared in order to protect the honor of Shabbos)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could be so, but we are afraid that one might be negligent and not make an Eruv.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa, offering a different basis for the institution of Eruv Tavshilin):</span> They used the Pasuk Es Asher Tofu Eifu...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> These words indicate that one must bake on the basis of that which was already baked, and cook based on that which was previously cooked.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This then, is the allusion in the Pasuk to Eruv Tavshilin.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>TORAH STUDY AND SIMCHAS YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Eliezer identified each group of those who left his Derashah as being drawn by successively smaller quantities of wine until he looked disparagingly at those who simply left the Beis Medrash looking empty.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Eliezer assured the remaining students that he was not angry with them, but at those who had left (abandoning eternal matters to engage in temporal ones), and he sent the remaining students home to enjoy their meals, invoking the Pasuk in Nechemiah (8:10).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Simchas Yom Tov is a Mitzvah (an eternal matter)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer was of the view that this Mitzvah is optional (as he taught in the Beraisa that one may fulfil Simchas Yom Tov with a day filled with feasting or with Torah study).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> The Yom Tov day should be divided between the two forms of Simchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They each resolve the Pesukim differently (Atzeres LaShem in Devarim and Atzeres LaChem in Bamidbar).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>THE VERSE IN NECHEMYAH (8:10)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is meant by sending portions l'Ein Nachon Lo?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chisda):</span> Send to he who did not make an Eruv Tavshilin (and thus cannot prepare for Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> To he who could not have prepared an Eruv (but not to the negligent one who did not do so).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is meant by Chedvas Hash-m Hi Ma'uzchem?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan citing R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> One may rely on Hash-m to cover the debts incurred by performing Simchas Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">11)</span><p>ANOTHER TEACHING FROM THE SAME SOURCE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan citing R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> One who wishes to preserve his property should plant an Adar (as alluded to in the Pasuk in Tehilim 93 or in the name Adar itself) as supported by the Beraisa (that a field with an Adar is not stolen and its fruits are preserved)</p></div>
