<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DESIGNATING A CHAYAH WHICH IS 'NESTING' IN ONE'S FIELD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(Rabah bar R. Huna citing Rav) One may close off a pool of water before Yom Tov and take the fish found within it in the morning (they are considered designated).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> From this teaching of Rav we may infer that the young of a Chayah which has made her home in one's Pardes may be taken with no specific Zimun.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman):</span> Our Chaver, R. Chisda (or, the son of our Chaver, if it was Rabah bar R. Huna), by comparing the young of a Chayah to the fish in a pool, has stepped into a great Machlokes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may readily differentiate between the two cases since he did designate the fish by the act of closing the pool, whereas he did nothing to designate the Chayah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Furthermore, we were taught that a Chayah <i>does</i> require Zimun!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refutes those who learn that a Chayah does not require Zimun.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But a Beraisa establishes that (both Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that) the Chayah (as opposed to a bird) does <i>not</i> require Zimun!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman):</span> One Beraisa refers to the young (which does not require Zimun) and one refers to the mother (which does).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the mother should require more than Zimun, she needs to be trapped!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, one Beraisa speaks where the young is in a field close to residence (more Da'as) and one where the field is further (less Da'as).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: SLAUGHTERING A DYING ANIMAL ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may not slaughter an animal unless there is time left on Yom Tov to eat a roasted k'Zayis of it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> Even if the time remaining is sufficient to eat a Kezayis from the place of Shechitah (without flaying the animal).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>An animal slaughtered in the field may not be carried by two people but may be carried, by hand, limb by limb.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FLAYING AN ANIMAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rami b. Aba):</span> From the requirement of flaying and cutting an Olah we learn the Derech Eretz for butchers, as well, that one should not eat prior to flaying and cutting the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rami b. Aba teaching us?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is coming to differ with R. Huna (and to require Hefshet and Nituach to check the animal for Kashrus and not to rely on Chazakah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah <i>supports</i> R. Huna (as R. Akiva allows a k'Zayis from the place of Shechitah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to the place of digestion (and hence it is after Nituach, not before), not the actual place of Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Chiya taught that it means the actual place of Shechitah!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Rami b. Aba taught us proper conduct (not Halachos of Tereifos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Similarly, the Beraisa teaches how to eat and drink.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Rami b. Aba also taught the moral lesson of certain vegetation (especially the Turmus).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>RELATED AGADIC TEACHINGS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Cited in R. Meir's name):</span> Torah was given (as antidote) to the fierce People, Israel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'vei R. Yishmael):</span> It is fitting to give this People the Aish Das, alternately, the Torah is needed to counter the fiery nature of Israel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> There are three fierce things...</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>PROHIBITIONS DUE TO DERECH CHOL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A blind person may not go out with his staff nor a shepherd with his cloak.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One may not be carried on a chair.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we have a report that R. Yehoshua b. Levi permitted this if the community needs the person (and we rely on the reports of those who carried R. Huna and Mar Shmuel on their chairs)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Those were permitted, as stated, only because the community needed them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Chama b. Ada asked this question of R. Zerika (having arrived in Tzur after the passing of R. Yakov b. Idi) who responded (citing R. Ami) that it is permitted, provided that the person is not borne on shoulders.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is meant by that?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Alonki.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Nachman permitted Alonki?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was due to Yalsa's fear (as we find a similar dispensation by Ameimar and Mar Zutra due to fear or, due to the pressure of the crowd).</p></div>
