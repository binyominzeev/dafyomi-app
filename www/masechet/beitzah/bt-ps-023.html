<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MOLID (CONTINUATION OF SMOKING FRUIT)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah and R. Yosef):</span> It is prohibited to place a cup of perfume on a silk garment on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this so?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because it creates (Molid) a fragrance in the garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should this be any different from creating an aroma by rolling the branch of an aromatic tree (which we know is permitted)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> By rolling the branch he is only adding to existing fragrance, whereas here he is creating the fragrance where none was there before.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is even permitted to smoke fruit on coals, as it is no different than roasting meat (a Shaveh l'chol Nefesh where both Kibuy and Hav'ara are permitted).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>KETURA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav Geviha announced enigmatically that Ketura is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ameimar):</span> If I understand its meaning correctly, Ketura should <i>not</i> be permitted (whether it is the skilled work associated with pressing the sleeve of a garment, or it is smoking fruit which causes Kibuy, it is not permitted)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> It refers to smoking fruit (which I hold is permitted, like Rava above).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>An alternate rendition of the above:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> Ketura should not be permitted (it is either skilled work or it is <i>Molid</i> a fragrance)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> I was told that Ketura is smoking fruit and is permitted, as above.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>GEDI MEKULAS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Chachamim censured Todus (who allowed Gedi Mekulas) for causing Jews to eat Kodeshim outside the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Gedi Mekulas really Kodeshim outside the Azarah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the censure was that it is too similar, and may lead others to err and eat Kodeshim baChutz.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE HETERIM OF R. ELAZAR B. AZARYAH ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>His Parah was allowed to go out with its strap between its horns (seeing it as an adornment not a burden).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>His animals were combed (scratched) with a metal comb.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Pepper may be ground in his mill.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> A metal comb may not be used (Mekardin) as it causes a Chaburah but a wooden comb may be used (Mekartzefin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> Neither is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE REFERENCE TO THE ONE COW OF R. ELAZAR B. AZARYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could we speak of his (one) cow when we know that his Ma'aser alone amounted to 13,000 head!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was his neighbor's, but his silent acquiescence causes it to be referred to as his.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>KIRUD VS. KIRTZUF AND DAVAR SH'EINO MISKAVEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The former employs a comb with small teeth which cause Chaburos, while the latter has thick teeth which do not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The three opinions regarding these combs are:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Davar sh'Eino Miskaven is Asur, hence Kirud is Asur and Kirtzuf is Mutar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> As above, but we forbid Kirud lest it be confused with Kirtzuf.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar b. Azaryah):</span> Davar sh'Eino Miskaven is Mutar (like R. Shimon) and he does not intend to cause Chaburos, hence both are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava citing R. Nachman citing Shmuel, or, R. Nachman alone):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon, as evidenced by the position of R. Elazar b. Azaryah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why not say the Halachah is like R. Yehudah, given the position of Chachamim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman):</span> I hold like R. Shimon and I find, in addition, that R. Elazar b. Azaryah supports this.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE PEPPER MILL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The pepper mill is made of three component parts, each bearing its own name, which implies separate Tum'ah for each.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>These are the Kli Kibul (which receives the pepper at the bottom), the Kli Mateches (the metal of the mill) and the Kli Kevarah (the sifter).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>THE BERAISA ANALYSES THE MILL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The lower Kli is wood and receives Tum'ah because it has a Beis Kibul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The middle (sifter) is also wood and receives Tum'ah because of a Gezeirah (given its similarity to a weaver).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The upper receives Tum'ah because, though it is largely wood without a Beis Kibul, it has a metal grinding base.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>MISHNAH: A CHILD'S TOY WAGON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A toy wagon (in which the child may ride) may receive Tumas Midras (were the child to be a Zav), it may be handled on Shabbos and it may not be dragged on the ground unless it is on a carpet of cloth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> No Kli may be dragged except the wagon which does not dig a channel, but it only pushes down the earth under its wheels.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>ANALYZING THE HALACHOS OF THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>It receives Tumas Midras because the child is supported by it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>It may be handled since it is considered a Kli.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>It may only be dragged on cloth, and, presumably, not on the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this so?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because it makes a Charitz, even though this is unintended.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This follows R. Yehudah (Davar sh'Eino Miskaven is Asur) and not R. Shimon (as he taught in the Beraisa, that it is permitted to drag even a chair or bed, provided he does not intend to make a Charitz thereby).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then how are we to understand R. Yehudah's position at the end of the Mishnah where he teaches that the wagon impresses the ground and <i>does not</i> dig a Charitz?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Machlokes regarding the position of R. Yehudah (the first Tana being concerned that, at times, the wheels of the wagon will be stuck and instead of pressing the ground it will dig a Charitz while the second Tana assumes that the wheels turn freely).</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">11)</span><p>MISHNAH: TRAPPING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One must not catch fish in a Bibar on Yom Tov, nor may one feed such fish.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One may, however, catch animals and fowl in a Bibar and give them food there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Gamliel):</span> It depends on whether the Bibar is small enough to consider the animal already trapped.</p></div>
