<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Beitzah she'Noldah</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> An egg laid on Yom Tov may be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> The egg may not be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Isur Chametz</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> One violates the Isur Chametz only once one has ka'Koseves.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> Like Se'or, Chametz is be'Kezayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Yachpor b'Deker</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> One may dig in order to perform Kisuy ha'Dam.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> The dirt must be prepared before Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Both agree that b'Di'eved, one may dig out the dirt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The ashes of a Kirah are Muchan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MUKTZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What type of chicken laid the egg in (1:a)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A chicken which was designated to be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then why would Beis Hillel forbid its egg (Uchla d'Ifras)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is rather a chicken designated to lay eggs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then it is Muktzah, and how could Beis Shamai permit it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps Beis Shamai do not hold of Muktzah (like R. Shimon).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe Nolad is worse than Muktzah!?</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE ANSWER OF R. NACHMAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman):</span> The chicken was designated to lay eggs, and permitting Muktzah implies permitting Nolad as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Nachman then seems to contradict himself regarding the views of Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Here he aligns Beis Hillel with R. Yehudah (stringent opinion regarding Muktzah) and Beis Shamai with R. Shimon (lenient view).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In the Mishnah dealing with bones and skins on Shabbos we read that Beis Hillel prohibits and Beis Shamai permits (consistent with our Mishnah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Yet, R. Nachman there switches the positions to align Beis Hillel with R. Shimon and Beis Shamai with R. Yehudah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Nachman was only following the cues left by R. Yehudah ha'Nasi when he dictated the anonymous Mishnayos and kept Beis Hillel aligned with the Halachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>By Shabbos the anonymous Mishnah (cited) follows R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>By Yom Tov the anonymous Mishnah (cited) follows R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Yehudah switch the positions?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is less concern that people will abuse a leniency by Shabbos than by Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Mishnah speaks of a chicken designated for laying eggs, then the Mishnah should teach the Isur regarding the chicken and we would know the Isur regarding the egg!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach us the extent of the Kula of Beis Shamai (even Nolad is permitted).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But teaching the Isur would inform us of the extent of the Chumra of Beis Hillel!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When left with a choice, we teach the strength of a Kula.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then satisfy both needs by combining the chicken and the egg in the Mishnah!?</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE ANSWER OF RABAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Rather, the chicken was designated for eating.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then why is it Asur?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because of Hachanah (Yom Tov after Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> An egg laid today was prepared yesterday.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> From the Pasuk we learn that one may not prepare on Yom Tov for Shabbos, nor the reverse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Then an egg laid on a mid-week Yom Tov should be permitted!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Gezeirah lest we permit an egg laid on Yom Tov after Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then an egg laid on a regular Shabbos (not Motzei Yom Tov) should be permitted!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Gezeirah lest we permit an egg laid on Shabbos after Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we learned that eggs found within a slaughtered chicken on Yom Tov may be eaten, and are not subject to a Gezeirah lest we permit eggs born on that day!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabanan do not apply Gezeiros to improbable cases such as finding a completed egg in a chicken.</p></div>
