<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TEFILAH ON SHABBOS AND YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> We recite eight Berachos (Shabbos and Yom Tov each getting its own Berachah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> We recite seven Berachos (inserting Yom Tov into the middle of the Shabbos Berachah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> We close the middle Berachah with a reference to Yom Tov, - Mekadesh ha'Shabbos, Yisrael v'haZemanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The wording taught before Ravina was Mekadesh Yisrael v'haShabbos v'haZemanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Ravina corrected it back to Mekadesh ha'Shabbos on the grounds that Yisrael is not Mekadesh Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> The Halachah follows Rebbi, as qualified by Ravina.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TEFILAH ON SHABBOS ROSH CHODESH OR CHOL HAMOED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> One must add Ya'aleh v'Yavo in Avodah of each regular Tefilah (repeating the Amidah if forgotten).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> It is said in Hoda'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> During Musaf, the Shabbos Amidah is said and Yom Tov is inserted into the middle Berachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Gamliel and R. Yishmael ben R. Yochanan b. Beroka):</span> Whenever we recited the shorter Amidah (seven Berachos instead of 18) we insert Kedushas ha'Yom into the middle of the Shabbos Berachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> The Halachah does not follow that pair.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ERUV TAVSHILIN WHEN TWO DAYS OF YOM TOV PRECEDE SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya b. Ashi citing Rav):</span> A conditional Eruv Techumin may be made on two days of Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The same can be said of Eruv Tavshilin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rav, who permits Eruv Techumin (which involves Kinyan Shevisa), would certainly permit Eruv Tavshilin (which is only a Siman Heter).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rava, who permits Eruv Tavshilin, would not permit Eruv Techumin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would one be more stringent?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because Techumin involves Kinyan Shevisa on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>BAKING FROM ONE DAY OF YOM TOV FOR THE NEXT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may not bake from one day of Yom Tov to the next.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We may state with confidence that one may cook a large quantity or draw a large quantity of water, even if one only needs a small part of that amount (the Tirchah is the same).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Baking, however (which requires dealing with each loaf individually) one may only bake that which he needs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Elazar):</span> One may fill the oven with bread even if he needs only one loaf because that loaf is enhanced by a full oven.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon b. Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT MAKING AN ERUV TAVSHILIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the consequence of not making an Eruv Tavshilin?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Is he forbidden to cook for Shabbos, and his flour may also not be prepared for Shabbos; or,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Is he forbidden but his flour is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Of what consequence is this question?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Whether or not his flour must be given as a gift to another person in order to be prepared (if his flour is prohibited then it must belong to someone else in order to be prepared).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa taught that his flour must be given as a gift to someone else, thus proving that his flour is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one eat, on Shabbos, that which was baked in spite of the absence of an Eruv Tavshilin?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If this food were permitted, then the previous Beraisa would have listed this as another way in which he may eat despite the absence of an Eruv!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is no proof, since the Beraisa is only discussing permitted ways of allowing him to eat, not the outcomes of violations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa (by ruling that one who is Ma'arim may not eat the prepared food on Shabbos) teaches that it is not permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Ashi):</span> But we may not extend the Halachah of Ha'aramah (where Chazal were likely to be more stringent since he is less likely to repent his action) to that of Mezid (where he knows he transgressed)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman b. Yitzchak):</span> The Beraisa which forbids in the case of Ha'aramah is the opinion of Chananiah (citing Beis Shamai who is Machmir regarding Eruv).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This view may not be applied l'Halachah to forbid the food of one who did not make an Eruv.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Beraisa (which prohibits the fruit which was tithed b'Mezid on Shabbos) provides proof that food prepared against an Isur d'Rabanan may not be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is no proof as that Beraisa speaks where he has other fruit to eat (whereas in the case of Eruv he has no other food to eat).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Another Beraisa forbids the use of Kelim which were intentionally immersed on Shabbos (again, in violation of an Isur d'Rabanan, presumably the same as Eruv).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Again, that speaks where he has, or can borrow, other utensils (presumably not applicable to food).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We were taught that one who intentionally cooks on Shabbos may not eat therefrom (proving that Mezid results in Isur).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is an Isur Torah, and does not extend to Eruv!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>ONE TAVSHIL (BEIS HILLEL) OR TWO (BEIS SHAMAI)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Our Mishnah is not in accordance with the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Elazar):</span> There is agreement that two Tavshilin are required, and the argument is over how to reckon fish fried with an egg.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai sees it as one dish and Beis Hillel reckons it as two.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They would agree that if the egg (or a vegetable) were prepared separately and placed into the fish that it would be considered two dishes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows our Tana (where Beis Hillel holds we need one Tavshil).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>IF THE ERUV WAS EATEN OR LOST</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Halachah is that if he has already begun kneading the dough when the Eruv was eaten he may complete the preparation of the bread.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>MISHNAH: TEVILAH ON SHABBOS IN PREPARATION FOR YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> All Tevilos must be done before Shabbos (since Tevilah is considered a Tikun).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> Kelim must be immersed before Shabbos but a person may immerse on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>They agree that water which was Tamei may be made Tahor through Hashakah (Zri'ah) in the Mikvah if placed in a stone Kli (but not through Tevilah in a wooden Kli).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>One is permitted to immerse in order to switch from one Gav to another and from one Chaburah to another.</p></div>
