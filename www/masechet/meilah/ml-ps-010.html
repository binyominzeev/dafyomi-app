<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THINGS THAT CANNOT BE OFFERED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Yes! The Reisha is R. Shimon, and the Seifa is Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All (Rav and R. Yochanan) agree that if one benefited from Tamei meat of Kodshei Kodashim before Zerikah, or Eimurim of Kodshim Kalim after they were offered, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. There is no loss (to Kohanim or Hekdesh)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since there are Mitzvos to do with them, to burn the meat and flip over the Eimurim on the fire (to burn well), Me'ilah applies. Rava teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Beraisa says that after Hakravah of a Chatas, the money goes to Yam ha'Melach. This is only if he realized his Me'ilah before Kaparah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he realized after Kaparah, it goes to Nedavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not separate money l'Chatchilah to be Hekdesh to go to waste (to be thrown into Yam ha'Melach).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KORBANOS WITHOUT MATIRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Me'ilah applies to the following from the time of Hekdesh: Kometz, Levonah, Ketores, Minchas Kohanim, Minchas (Chavitim) of a Mashi'ach Kohen Gadol, Minchas Nesachim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>After Kidush in a Kli Shares, they can become Pasul through a Tevul Yom, Mechusar Kipurim, or Linah. Nosar and Tamei apply, but Pigul does not apply;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The general rule is, if something has Matirim (something else is offered to permit it), Pigul, Nosar and Tamei do not apply until the Matirim are offered;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If something has no Matirim, Nosar and Tamei apply after Kidush in a Kli Shares, but Pigul does not apply.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is liable for eating b'Tum'ah only something that has Matirim to people or the Mizbe'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> A Kal va'Chomer supports this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Pigul is stringent.) One must bring a Chatas for eating Pigul (b'Shogeg) even if there was only one Yedi'ah (he found out only afterwards. He never knew that it was Pigul before he ate it), the Chatas is Kavu'a (an animal, even if he is poor), and Pigul is never permitted, yet it applies only to something that has Matirim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(Tum'ah is more lenient.) One brings a Korban only if there were two Yedi'os (he knew that he was Tamei and later forgot, ate the Kodshim, and later found out that he was Tamei), the Korban is Oleh v'Yored (a poor person brings birds), it is sometimes permitted (e.g. a Korban Tzibur that cannot be brought b'Taharah). All the more so it should apply only to something with Matirim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "... Kol Ish Asher Yikrav... (Asher Yakdishu Bnei Yisrael)... " (teaches that the Isur of Tum'ah applies to every Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is liable from the moment of Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection - Question (R. Elazar):</span> It says "Asher <i>Yikrav</i>" (this" connotes touching). Surely, one is not Chayav Kares just for touching Kodshim (b'Tum'ah, only for eating)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the verse teaches about Kodshim with Matirim. One is not liable until <i>Hakravah</i> of the Matirim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it has no Matirim, one is liable after Kidush in a Kli. (We learn Nosar from a Gezeirah Shavah from Tum'ah.)</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK VLAD CHATAS</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>CHATA'OS</i> THAT MUST DIE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following Chata'os must die -- Vlad Chatas, Temuras Chatas and she'Mesu Ba'aleha (its owner died);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>She'Avrah Shenasah (it was not offered within its first year), or (even a yearling) that was lost and was found with a Mum (after another animal was Hukdash to replace it):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(If it was found) after Kaparah, it must die. It does not make Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One may not benefit from it, and Me'ilah does not apply to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Before Kaparah, it (she'Avrah Shenasah; alternatively, a lost Chatas found with a temporary Mum) grazes until it gets a (permanent) Mum. He brings a replacement with its redemption money;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It makes Temurah, and Me'ilah applies to it.</p>
