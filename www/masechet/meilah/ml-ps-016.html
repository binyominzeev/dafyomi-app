<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH <i>NEVEILOS</i> JOIN WITH EACH OTHER?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Nevelos join with each other, all Sheratzim (Tosfos - the eight mentioned in the Torah) join with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> They join only for Tum'ah. Regarding eating, (Nevelos of) Tahor animals join with each other, and Teme'im join with each other (but Tahor and Tamei do not join);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Levi):</span> All join even for eating;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> Tehorim join with each other. Teme'im join with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> R. Asi argues with Rav. (Rav Asi holds that Tahor and Tamei do not join even regarding Tum'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> R. Asi agrees with Rav. (He refers only to eating.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Asi - Beraisa #1):</span> A dead cow and a live camel do not join. (Tosfos - the question is also against Rav. Surely they do not join regarding Tum'ah, rather, regarding eating!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If both of them are dead, they join!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No. Rather, we infer that if both are alive, they join (to be liable for eating Ever Min ha'Chai);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa is like R. Yehudah, who says that Ever Min ha'Chai applies to Tamei species.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> You want to say that if both are dead, they do not join. Inf so, the Tana should have taught this (it is a bigger Chidush), instead of when only one is dead!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Beraisa #2):</span> A half-k'Zayis of a live cow and a half-k'Zayis of a dead camel do not join;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, a half-k'Zayis of a cow and a half-k'Zayis of a camel, whether both are dead or both are alive, join.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Seifa contradicts the Reisha! (It connotes that they always join, even if the cow is alive and the camel is dead; alternatively, it says that if both are dead they join. The Gemara knows that this Beraisa (#2) is the Seifa of Beraisa #1.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This Tana holds that Isur Chal Al Isur. Rav Asi holds like Tana'im who say that Ein Isur Chal Al Isur.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One who eats a k'Zayis of Sheratzim is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah forbids "Achilas" Sheratzim. This refers to a k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina recited a Beraisa that opposes this, and R. Yochanan praised it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina - Beraisa) Question:</span> Why does the verse "v'Hivdaltem Bein ha'Behemah ha'Tehorah la'Teme'ah... v'Lo Seshaktzu Es Nafshoseichem ba'Behemah... uv'Chol Asher Hivdalti Lachem Letamei" begin with eating ("v'Lo Seshaktzu") and end with Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that just like k'Adashah (the volume of a lentil) is the Shi'ur for Tum'ah of Sheratzim, it is the Shi'ur (to be liable) for eating. (Tosfos - this challenges Rav, for a verse supports R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina, and no one argues with him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi's teaching applies to a dead Sheretz. (It is Tamei; we equate eating to Tum'ah). Rav discusses a live Sheretz (which is Tahor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Rav discusses our Mishnah, which discusses dead Sheratzim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> <i>You</i> think that he discusses our Mishnah. You are wrong. It is an independent teaching.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>SHI'URIM</i> FOR EATING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Yochanan had praised R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina's Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He contradicts what he said elsewhere!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A limb of any size is Tamei, even a limb less than a k'Zayis of a (person or) Nevelah, or a limb less than k'Adashah of a Sheretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is not lashed unless he ate a k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The verse ("v'Hivdaltem... ") discusses Muvdalim (things that are different, i.e. the eight Sheratzim mentioned in the Torah that are Metamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> We should also distinguish among Behemos between Muvdalim and others! (Rashi - Tehorim are different (permitted to eat). The Shi'ur Tum'ah for Teme'im should be more, e.g. k'Beitzah (the volume of an egg). Tosfos - Teme'im are different, for they are forbidden. One should be liable for a limb of any size.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They are equated regarding "v'Lo Seshaktzu" (the Lav applies to Sheratzim and Nevelos of Tahor and Tamei Behemos alike), but not regarding Shi'urim.</p>
