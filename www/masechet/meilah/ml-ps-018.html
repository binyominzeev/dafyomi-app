<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FOODS AND MATERIALS THAT JOIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Orlah (fruits of a tree in the first three years) and Kil'ai ha'Kerem (crossbreeds in a vineyard) join with each other (to be lashed for eating a k'Zayis);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon says, they do not join.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> R. Shimon does not need them to join. He holds that one is lashed for any amount of Isurim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he means that they do not need to join.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (The Shi'urim to receive (regular) Tum'ah for fabric, sackcloth, leather and matting are, respectively, three fingers (by three fingers), four Tefachim (by four Tefachim), five Tefachim and six Tefachim. Something fitting to lie or sit on receives Tum'as Mishkav u'Moshav. It can become an Av ha'Tum'ah if a Zav or Nidah sits on it.) The following join (for the Shi'ur) -- fabric and sackcloth, sackcloth and leather, leather and matting. (Here, the Bartenura says that all the materials join to comprise the largest Shi'ur among them. In Kelim (27:4) he says (regarding garments) that only the pairs listed join, i.e. each with the material with the next largest Shi'ur.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Shimon says, they join because a common Shi'ur of Moshav applies to all of them:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If one cut from all (Rambam - from any one) of them and made a garment for Mishkav, it must be three Tefachim (to be Mekabel Tum'ah. The garment was cut smoothly, therefore a smaller Shi'ur applies);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was for a Moshav (a seat), it must be one Tefach. If it was for a handle, any size (Rambam - at least three fingers) is Mekabel Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of handle is discussed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> It is a protection (from the threads that are tightened around the fingers) put on the fingers of weavers;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> It is put over the hands of those who harvest figs (to keep their hands clean; Pirush Kadmon (A) - alternatively, so their hands will not get cut).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES <i>ME'ILAH</i> DEPEND ON <i>PEGAM</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> One who benefits a Shavah Perutah from Hekdesh is Mo'el, even if he is not Pogem the item (decrease its value);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, if the Hekdesh item is subject to be Nifgam, he is not Mo'el unless he is Pogem. If it is not normally Nifgam, he is Mo'el once he benefits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One is Mo'el in the following cases of benefit from Hekdesh (if one would pay a Perutah to rent such an object of Chulin);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One wore a choker (tight necklace) on her neck, or a ring on her finger, or drank from a gold cup.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>In the following cases, one is not Mo'el unless he is Pogem --</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He wore or covered himself with a garment, he chopped with an axe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If one benefits from a live Chatas, he is not Mo'el unless he is Pogem;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If he benefits from a dead Chatas, he is Mo'el for benefit in any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> R. Akiva agrees regarding something that is prone to be Nifgam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They argue about (things that are not perceivably Nifgam for a long time, e.g.) an intermediate garment (it is not external, nor next to the skin) or a fine linen garment (one wears it only rarely. Most Rishonim - R. Akiva considers such things as if they are not prone to Pegam. R. Gershom - they are considered prone to Pegam. It is if he benefited and was Pogem.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Nefesh" (in the verse discussing Me'ilah) refers to a commoner, Nasi (king) or Mashu'ach (anointed Kohen Gadol);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>"Ki Sim'ol Ma'al" refers to Shinuy (change, from Hekdesh to Chulin);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from "Ish Ish Ki Sisteh Ishto u'Ma'alah Vo Ma'al" and "va'Yim'alu b'Elokei Avoseihem va'Yiznu Acharei Elohei Amei ha'Aretz." (These are written regarding Sotah and idolatry.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE GEZEIRAH SHAVAH FROM TERUMAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Me'ilah applies in the following cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One was Pogem without deriving benefit, or benefited without Pegam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Hekdesh was attached to the ground;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text):</span> A Shali'ach fulfilled his mission. (Perhaps the Shali'ach was Mo'el.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2  (Bach):</span> A Shali'ach did not fulfill his mission. (Perhaps the sender was Mo'el.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah. It says "Chet" regarding Me'ilah, just like regarding Terumah. (It says "Chet" regarding a Tamei who eats Terumah (Vayikra 22:9) and regarding separating Terumah (Bamidbar 18:32). The Rishonim say that we learn from a Zar who ate Terumah b'Shogeg, which following the former verse.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding (eating) Terumah there is Pegam and benefit, the one who was Pogem benefited from what was Nifgam, the Pegam and benefit came at the same time, the benefit was from something detached, and Shelichus (to separate Terumah) works only if the Shali'ach fulfilled his mission. Likewise, Me'ilah applies only when all of these are fulfilled. (Regarding Shelichus, the sender was Mo'el if the Shali'ach fulfilled his mission. If he deviated, the Shali'ach was Mo'el.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Gershom's text) Question #1:</span> We know that one is Mo'el only if he ate. What is the source that one who benefited from Hekdesh not prone to Pegam was Mo'el?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> What is the source that what Reuven ate or benefited from joins with what (he gave to Shimon and) Shimon ate or benefited from to make Reuven liable for Me'ilah, even over a long period of time? (Tosfos - we must say that Reuven put the food in Shimon's mouth, or commanded Shimon to take the food, causing Shimon to acquire it before eating it. Keren Orah - really, Question #2 concerns only joining Shimon's benefit (benefit over a long period is mentioned only by the way). Question (g) addresses benefit over a long period, and Question (j) concerns joining benefit in different years, i.e. Yom Kipur does not atone for a partial Shi'ur of Me'ilah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> "Sim'ol Ma'al" includes these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Achilos (acts of eating) of Terumah at different times (not within Kedei Achilas Pras) do not join (to comprise a Shi'ur) -- perhaps the Gezeirah Shavah teaches that the same applies to Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Achilos join for Me'ilah, even on different days or after a long time?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Sim'ol Ma'al" includes this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One is liable for (eating) Terumah only if Pegam and benefit came together. Perhaps the Gezeirah Shavah teaches that the same applies to Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to join what Reuven ate (with what Shimon ate; some delete this. It is not in the text in Toras Kohanim), even over a period of three years (or more)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Sim'ol Ma'al" includes this.</p>
