<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yishmael):</span> She is a full Shifchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov (some texts - R. Elazar ben Azaryah) says, all the other Arayos are explicit. The only one left is a half-Shifchah, half-free woman.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak):</span> It means that she will be punished amidst Krai (recital of verses);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The most important judge reads ("Im Lo Sishmor... v'Hifla Hash-m Es Makosecha"). The next most important counts, and the third says "lash him!"</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He brings a Korban only when she is lashed.</p>

Why does it mention her lashes ("Bikores Tihyeh") before his Korban?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that he brings a Korban only when she is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Torah exempts him from lashes ("Bikores Tihyeh"), but she should be lashed <i>and</i> bring a Korban!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "va'Tishtach Alav <i>ha'Rifos</i>." (Th wheat is crushed.

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> She was freed, but not fully. She is half-slave and half-free, <i>Me'ureses</i> to an Eved Ivri (who is permitted to a Shifchah. Usually, "Erusin" means Kidushin. Amora'im (Gitin 43a) argue about whether it does here.

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Ki Lo Chupasah" already teaches that she was not freed. Surely, we must expound "v'Hefdeh Lo Nifdasah"!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not need "Ki Lo Chupasah" to teach that she was not freed, so we use it to teach that he was not freed.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Tana (a reciter of Beraisos) - Beraisa):</span> One who is Gomer (does a complete act of relations) is considered like one who did Ha'arah.

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Questions (Rav Sheshes):</span> If this refers to Shifchah Charufah, it should not consider Gomer like Ha'arah. Regarding Shifchah, only Gomer is liable!</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Shichvas Zera" (R. Gershom - she is Mazra'as only k'Darkah).</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If the Beraisa discusses other Arayos, it should not say that Gomer is like Ha'arah. Just the contrary, the Chidush is that Ha'arah is like Gomer!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Tana:</span> I will cease to teach the Beraisa. (It is mistaken.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> It is proper. It refers to Shifchah. It means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who is Gomer Lo k'Darkah is exempt, like one who did Ha'arah k'Darkah, for it says "Shichvas Zera";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who had intent (and had relations) Lo k'Darkah is exempt, like one who did not intend, k'Darkah, for it says "Shichvas Zera";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who was awake (and had relations) Lo k'Darkah is exempt, like one who was sleeping, k'Darkah, for it says "Shichvas Zera". (This suffices to explain the Beraisa. R. Gershom - the Gemara now gives another explanation, that the Beraisa contrasts Shifchah with other Arayos. Shitah - the continuation shows that Shifchah differs only regarding Ha'arah and Lo k'Darkah, but not regarding intent.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One who did Ha'arah with intent on a Shifchah is exempt, like one who did not intend regarding other Arayos;</p>
