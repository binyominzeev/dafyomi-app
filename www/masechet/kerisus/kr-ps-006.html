<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Oshaya):</span> The Mishnah refers to Ketores given to a worker for wages;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl>(Mishnah #2) Question:</span> What do we do with excess Ketores? (One Maneh of Ketores is burned every day, and an additional double handful (which is less than a Maneh) on Yom Kipur. The total for a regular year (354 days) is less than the 368 Manos of Ketores prepared in one batch. In a leap year (384 days) there will be (enough and) excess if there were at least 16 or 17 Manos of leftover Ketores from last year (we add these to the 368). The excess cannot simply be used the next year, for it was bought with Shekalim of last year, and Korbanos Tzibur must be bought from Shekalim given for the current year.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We separate money (of Bedek ha'Bayis) to give to workers (for Bedek ha'Bayis) for their wages (R.

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We then buy back the Ketores with money from the new Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> Regarding all leftovers, we learned (Shitah Mekubetzes - Rav Yehudah taught) that they would buy them back from the new Terumah. Regarding Ketores, it does not say this! (This shows that Mishnah #1 does not discuss Ketores. Shitah Mekubetzes (36) - even though in the Seifa of Mishnah #1, Ben Azai says that it is bought back from the new Terumah, the first Tana (R. Akiva) does not say so. Alternatively, the text reads "it is bought back from Terumas ha'Lishkah" (it does not say "new"), i.e. it is bought back right away, unlike Ketores which is bought back only at the end of the year, from the <i>new</i> Terumah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> The Makdish had one of the ingredients for the Ketores.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A batch of 368 Manos of Ketores was made at once. This is one Maneh for every day (on the average, there are 365 days in a year) and three Manos from which the Kohen Gadol would take a double handful on Yom Kipur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The leftover was given to workers for wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What do we do with excess Ketores?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Money was separated to be given to workers for their wages, they would be Mechalel the extra Ketores on the money and pay the workers with Ketores, and buy it back from (the new) Terumas ha'Lishkah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> The extra Ketores every year would accumulate. Every 60 or 70 years (about 184 Manos would be leftover,) they would make just half a batch. (Rosh (in Shitah) rejects this text, for the excess in 60 years cannot suffice (an average year is really 365 <i>and a quarter</i> days, the average annual excess is two and three quarter Manos less the double handful.) Some say that it is possible, if the last two years were not leap years. Many prefer the text "every 72 years." Calculations of the double handful range from a fifth of a Maneh to a half-Maneh. Our text implies that the average was between 60 and 70 years. If we ignore the double handfuls, a half-batch would suffice about every 67 years. If we account for them, the double handfuls would have to be miniscule to average significantly less than every 70 years. However, if we say that the weight of a batch was really more than 368 due to ingredients whose weight the Gemara ignored (e.g. wine absorbed by the Tziporen, salt... ) and/or Hachra'os (perhaps we learn from Shemen ha'Mishchah), the average frequency could be anywhere between 60 and 70 years, even if the double handful was bigger.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Therefore, if an individual made a half-batch of Ketores, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We never heard that a third or quarter batch was made.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Chachamim say, one may prepare even just one Maneh, the amount offered each day, and offer it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>This supports Rava;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one makes a half-batch of Ketores, he is liable. "Veha'Ketores Asher Ta'aseh" forbids whatever one makes (that is valid for Haktarah). The Tzibur offers half a Maneh in the morning and a half in the afternoon. (Rashi according to Shitah Mekubetzes - Rava means that he is liable if he makes a full day's worth, i.e. a Maneh. Rosh (in Shitah 4) - one is liable for making a k'Zayis, for b'Di'eved, Haktarah of even a k'Zayis is valid.)</p>
