<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DID R. YEHOSHUA AGREE WITH R. AKIVA?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> The Seifa shows that he did not agree to the challenge!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If he ate from five Korbanos in one He'elem, he brings a Chatas for each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #1:</span> Tana'im argue about whether he agreed to it. (The Tana of the Reisha says that he did. The Tana of the Seifa says that he did not.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> The whole Beraisa is like R. Akiva (regarding Chiluk Chata'os). The Tana holds like R. Akiva that only Ha'alamos are Mechalek Chata'os, but he argues with him about Safek Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In which case is he liable five times for Me'ilah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> (He ate from five different things offered from or with an Olah,) like a Mishnah teaches:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Five parts of an Olah join to be liable for Me'ilah -- the meat, Chelev, wine, Soles and oil (of its Nesachim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chizkiyah):</span> (Even if he ate only meat, he is liable five times if) he ate from five different limbs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Reish Lakish):</span> (He can be liable even from only one limb, e.g.) he ate from (five different bones that comprise) the shoulder.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> (He can be liable even from only one bone, e.g.) he ate from five different Tavshilim (e.g. meat with onions, meat with gourds... ).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (R. Yochanan):</span> (He can be liable even for plain meat from one bone, e.g.) he ate meat in five different ways (e.g. cooked in water, roasted... ).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MULTIPLE <i>MELACHOS</i> ON MANY <i>SHABBOSOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva) Question:</span> If one did many Melachos (i.e. Vlados) derived form one (Av) Melachah on many Shabbosos in one He'elem, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is he liable once, or for each?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Eliezer):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that he is liable for each:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nidah is just one prohibition (Bi'ah), there is only one Kares, yet one (who has relations with many Nidos) is liable for each. There are many prohibitions (Melachos) of Shabbos, all are Mechayev Misah and Kares, all the more so one is liable for each!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> You cannot learn from Nidah, for it is a two-way Isur. She is forbidden just like he is. Shabbos is a one-way Isur. Only the person is commanded, but not Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> I learn from relations with Nidos who are minors. Only he is forbidden, and he is liable for each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Granted, minors are exempt now, but when they mature they will be commanded. Regarding Shabbos, only he is commanded!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> I learn from relations with animals. Only he is forbidden, and he is liable for each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> (Relations with) animals are like Shabbos (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What did R. Akiva ask about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he asked whether or not different Shabbosos are like Gufim Muchlakim (to obligate for each Shabbos, even though it was all one He'elem), he should have asked about doing one Melachah on many Shabbosos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He asked whether or not one is liable for different Vlados Melachos (of one Av) like one is liable for different Avos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, he should have asked about this on one Shabbos. Why did he discuss many Shabbosos?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah (text of Shitah)):</span> He asked about both of these:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He asked whether or not different Shabbosos are like Gufim Muchlakim, and whether or not one is liable for different Vlados of one Av.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What case of Melachos on many Shabbosos did he ask about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Was it clear to him that for Shigegas Shabbos and Zadon Melachos (he forgot that it was Shabbos and remembered the Melachos) the days between Shabbosos are considered Yedi'ah Lechalek (as if he realized his mistake in between, i.e. separate Ha'alamos), and he asked only about Zadon Shabbos and Shigegas Melachos, whether or not the Shabbosos are like Gufim (Muchlakim, as if he did different Melachos? In this discussion, for brevity, we will mention only which was Shogeg (Shabbos or Melachos), and the other was Mezid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, was it clear to him that for Shigegas Melachos, the Shabbosos are like Gufim. He asked only about Shigegas Shabbos, whether or not the Shabbosos are like Yedi'ah Lechalek?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> (A Mishnah teaches that) he knew about Shigegas Shabbos. He asked about Shigegas Melachos;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer answered that the Shabbosos are like Gufim, and that Vlados of one Av are like different Avos. R. Akiva did not accept either answer. ("Animals are like Shabbos" means, I am unsure whether or not he is liable for each animal, just like I am unsure about Shabbos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A great, general rule of Shabbos -- if one forgot the entire Mitzvah of Shabbos and did many Melachos on many Shabbosos, he is liable only once;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he knew the Mitzvah of Shabbos, but (on many Shabbosos forgot that it is Shabbos) and did many Melachos on many Shabbosos, he is liable once for each Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he knew that it is Shabbos but forgot many Melachos and did them on many Shabbosos, he is liable once for each Av Melachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Observation:</span> It does not say that he is liable for each Av for each Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Seifa):</span> If one did many Vlados derived from one Av, he is liable only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Eliezer is Mechayev for each!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Mishnah is like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> It is clear to him that for Shigegas Shabbos, the days between Shabbosos are considered Yedi'ah. He asked only about Shigegas Melachos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Eliezer answered that the Shabbosos are like Gufim, and that Vlados are like Avos. R. Akiva did not accept either answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 - Abaye):</span> Perhaps it was clear to him that for Shigegas Melachos, Shabbosos are <i>not</i> Gufim, and he asked about Shigegas Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer answered that the Shabbosos are like Yedi'ah. R. Akiva accepted this. ("Animals are like Shabbos" means 'I agree that just like different animals are Mechalek as if there was Yedi'ah in between. The same applies to Shabbos.')</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer also said that Vlados are like Avos. R. Akiva did not accept this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Chisda):</span> R. Akiva agrees that for Shigegas Melachos, the Shabbosos are like Gufim - he asked about Shigegas Shabbos, whether or not Shabbosos are like Yedi'os;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer answered that they are. R. Akiva accepted this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer said that Vlados are like Avos. R. Akiva did not accept this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Chisda, for himself, and question against Rabah - Beraisa #1):</span> If one wrote two letters in one He'elem, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Gamliel obligates even if he wrote them in two Ha'alamos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Gamliel agrees that if he wrote them on different Shabbosos, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Gamliel):</span> If one wrote one letter on each of two Shabbosos, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>We are thinking that R. Gamliel holds like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>This is not difficult for me (Rav Chisda). R. Akiva agrees that for Shigegas Melachos, Shabbosos are like Gufim. This is the case in Beraisa #1 (he is exempt, like one who did a half-Shi'ur of each of two different Melachos);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Beraisa #2 discusses Shigegas Shabbos. R. Gamliel obligates because he holds that Ein Yedi'ah l'Chetzi Shi'ur. (What he eats later joins to complete the Shi'ur.)</p>
