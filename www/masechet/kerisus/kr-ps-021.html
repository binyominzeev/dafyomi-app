<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LIABILITY FOR EATING BLOOD (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Torah write both "Ohf" and "Behemah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it written only "Ohf," one might have thought that the Isur of Dam applies only to things like birds, i.e. that Kil'ayim (the Isur of wool and linen) does not apply to them. (Sheep would be excluded.) Therefore, it must write "Behemah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it written only "Behemah," one might have thought that the Isur of Dam applies only to things like Behemos, i.e. that Em Al ha'Banim (the Isur to take a mother from its eggs or young) does not apply to them. (This would exclude Tamei (R. Gershom - and domestic) birds.) Therefore, it must write "Ohf."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should say that "Kol Dam" is a Klal, and Ohf and Behemah are Peratim. From a Klal u'Ferat we only learn the Peratim, i.e. birds and Behemos, but nothing else!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Nefesh Asher Tochal Kol Dam" is another Klal, so we have a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal, from which we learn everything similar to the Peratim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The opening and closing Kelalim are dissimilar! The opening Klal is only a Lav, but the closing Klal is Kares!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana is Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael, who expounds such a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>We have a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal. We learn everything similar to the Peratim, i.e. things with light and severe Tum'ah, they are forbidden but can become permitted, and they are meat. Whatever has all these qualities, its blood is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Avin):</span> It includes blood of a Koy (a Kosher animal of doubtful classification).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SIMILARITIES OF A <i>KOY</i> TO <i>BEHEMOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Tana's opinion about a Koy?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is unsure whether it is a Behemah or a Chayah, the Torah would not need to (make a Klal, Prat and Klal to) teach about it! (In any case its blood is forbidden.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that it is a creation unto itself. (It is not a Behemah nor Chayah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Klal, Prat and Klal forbids its blood. What is the source to forbid its Chelev?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Kol Chelev."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to forbid its Nevelah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Chol Nevelah" (Devarim 14:21).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to forbid its Gid ha'Nasheh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah forbids the sinew on "Kaf ha'Yarech." Since it has a (round) cover on its leg bone, the Isur applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Tum'ah (of its Nevelah) and the need to slaughter it (to prevent it from becoming Nevelah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reasoning teaches this. Since it is like a Behemah in all the above ways, surely it is like a Behemah regarding Tum'ah and Shechitah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHICH FLESH IS <i>TAMEI</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We exclude human blood, for people have only severe Tum'ah, but not light Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If one cut flesh off a person, it is not Mekabel Tum'ah until there is intent (to use it for food) and Hechsher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is intent needed? Cutting it off (shows that he cares about it, it) is like intent!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> It was cut off to feed it to a dog. It is not Mekabel Tum'ah until there is intent to feed it to a person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Intent to feed to a dog suffices for Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The general rule of Tum'ah is, anything normally eaten only by people is Tamei as long as a dog could eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once food was Mekabel Tum'ah, it does not cease to be Mekabel Tum'ah until it is improper for a dog;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A food is not initially Mekabel Tum'ah unless it is fit for people.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Crux of contradiction:</span> The Mishnah discusses intent for human flesh. This is relevant only to light Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Flesh from a live person has light Tum'ah. Flesh from a Mes has only severe Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also regarding animals, flesh and blood from a Nevelah have (only) severe Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Blood of a Nevelah is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel is Metamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Flesh from a Nevelah has light Tum'ah in the following case:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following require intent, but they do not require Hechsher: the Nevelah of a Tamei animal in any place; and Nivlas Ohf Tahor in villages.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav):</span> Why is intent needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> It is needed for light Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav):</span> It itself is Metamei (severe Tum'ah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> The case is, there is less than a k'Zayis of Nevelah. It joins with less than a k'Beitzah.(the volume of an egg) of food to complete the Shi'ur of k'Beitzah for Tum'as Ochlim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should require Hechsher!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Kol Zera Zeru'a (is not Mekabel Tum'ah unless it was Huchshar)" teaches that Hechsher is needed only for things such as seeds, which will never have severe Tum'ah (but not Nevelah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> That applies to normal food. Here, there is less than a k'Zayis of Nevelah. If we would have a full k'Zayis, it would be Tamei without Hechsher. (Therefore, even now it does not need Hechsher.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding a Mes, even if there would be a full k'Zayis, it would not have Tum'as Ochlim. Even if one would intent to eat it, his intent is ignored, since normal people would not eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chananyah):</span> There can even be a full k'Zayis of Nevelah. T.he case is, dough covers it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> If so (the Nevelah is covered), it is as if it does not have severe Tum'ah (it is not Metamei one who touches it). It should require Hechsher!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hechsher is needed for something that does not have severe Tum'ah through Maga (touching) nor Masa (moving or supporting);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Here, granted it does not have Tum'as Maga, but it has Tum'as Masa, for if one moves or bears a covered Nevelah, he moves or bears the Nevelah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of Answer #2:</span> In a similar case of a Mes, a k'Zayis of a Mes covered by dough, since Tum'as Mes breaks through the cover, there is still severe Tum'ah. (There is no "room" for light Tum'ah!)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH BLOODS ARE FORBIDDEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (Blood of) Sheratzim is excluded, for they lack severe Tum'ah. (Rashi deletes this citation, and the coming question and answer from the text, for also Ohf lacks Tum'as Masa. Shitah does not delete it. Perhaps it is understood as we explain.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Sheratzim have Tum'as Maga!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They have Tum'as Maga, but not Tum'as Masa. (The latter is more severe. It is Metamei the garments that the person was weasring at the time.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We exclude (blood of) fish and grasshoppers, for <i>they are wholly permitted</i>.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Their Chelev is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Chelev of Chayos is permitted, yet their blood is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Isur of Gid ha'Nasheh does not apply to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Isur of Gid ha'Nasheh does not apply to birds, yet their blood is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It means that they are permitted without Shechitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (Had the Torah written only 'Ohf," one might have thought that) the Isur of Dam applies only to things like birds, i.e. that Kil'ayim does not apply to them. Therefore, it must write "Behemah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Kil'ayim does this refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to the Isur to cause diverse species to mate or work together.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> The Isur (to cause diverse species to mate or work together) applies to birds and Chayos, just like to Behemos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It refers to Kil'ai Begadim. It does not apply to the wool (feathers) of birds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One is lashed for eating a k'Zayis of Dam Sheratzim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A Lav forbids the following bloods -- of the spleen, heart, kidneys, and limbs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The following are forbidden, but one is not liable for them -- blood of people, Sheratzim and Remashim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that one is not Chayav Kares for them, but he transgresses a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> If so, they would be included in the Reisha!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> The Tana (of the Beraisa on 20b) explicitly exempts Dam Sheratzim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (Blood of) Sheratzim is excluded, for they lack severe Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (R. Zeira):</span> If he was warned not to eat Sheratzim (and ate Dam Sheratzim), he is lashed. If he was warned not to eat Dam, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHICH BLOODS ARE FORBIDDEN? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one gathered fish blood, it is forbidden (it can be confused with animal blood, people might come to permit the latter).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> Blood of fish and grasshoppers is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is l'Chatchilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is permitted if it was not gathered (e.g. it is still in the fish).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beraisa #1 forbids human blood. We cannot say that this is even if it was not gathered!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If blood is on a loaf, one scrapes it off and the loaf is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may swallow blood between one's teeth without concern. (Rashi - blood on the loaf, even though it is not gathered, is basically permitted. It is a mere stringency not to eat it. Tosfos - if you would say that Beraisa #1 permits even gathered fish blood, you could say that it forbids gathered human blood. However, since you say that it permits fish blood only if it never separated, if any case of human blood is permitted, it should teach it!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #1 permits gathered fish blood in which there are scales. (It is evident that it is fish blood). Rav forbids when there are no scales inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> There is no Mitzvah to refrain from eating human blood, not even a mere stringency.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A Lav forbids the following bloods - of the spleen, heart, kidneys, and limbs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The following are forbidden, but one is not liable for them - blood of people, Sheratzim and Remashim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa forbids it when it separated. Rav Sheshes permits it when it did not separate:</p>
