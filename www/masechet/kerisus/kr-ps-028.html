<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CAN BA'ALEI CHAYIM BECOME NIDACHIM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar citing R. Oshaya):</span> If an Ashir transgressed Tum'as Mikdash, and was Makdish a Kan (he wanted to bring a Korban Oni), since it is Nidcheh (disqualified, he cannot bring it now), it is (permanently) Nidcheh (even if he will become an Oni).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We learn three laws from this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Dichuy applies to Kedushas Damim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ba'alei Chayim (living creatures) can be Nidachim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Dichuy from the start is considered Dichuy. (Rashi - normally, a bird cannot have Kedushas Damim, for it cannot be redeemed! Here, since it was never fit for the Korban, it has Pidyon. Rosh (in Shitah) - it cannot be redeemed. Since it does not have Kedushas ha'Guf, it is called Kedushas Damim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ukva bar Chama - Beraisa):</span> If one was Makdish a female for (Korban) Pesach, it grazes until it gets a Mum. Its (redemption) money is used to buy (a valid) Pesach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it gave birth to a male, the child grazes until it gets a Mum. Its money is for Pesach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, the child itself is offered for Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> (From R. Shimon) we learn that Ba'alei Chayim are not Nidachim, (If the mother were Nidcheh, her child would be Nidcheh. Rosh - we are thinking that in this case, Chachamim say that Migo (since) the female gets Kedushas Damim, it gets Kedushas ha'Guf, and R. Shimon does not say this Migo. Birds have no Kedushas Damim, Chachamim agree that they do not get Kedushas ha'Guf. We have no source to say that they argue and say that Ba'alei Chayim are Nidachim in such a case.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Bei R. Oshaya):</span> We know that R. Shimon holds that Ba'alei Chayim Ein Nidachim (even when they have Kedushas ha'Guf) and the lottery (of the goats of Yom Kipur) is not Me'akev. Our law is like Chachamim (of the above Beraisa, or in many Mishnayos, who say that Ba'alei Chayim (with Kedushas ha'Guf) are Nidachim):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If one of the goats died, we take a replacement for it. We do not need a new lottery.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SPECIFYING A <i>KAN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A Kan becomes Mefurash (specified, which bird is the Chatas and which is the Olah) only at the time the owner bought it, or (if he did not specify at the time) when the Kohen offers it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Simi Bar Ashi):</span> He learns from "v'Lokchah Shtei Sorim... " and "v'Osah ha'Kohen... " (Both verses say that one is for Chatas, and one is for Olah.) The owner decides which is for which at the time of purchase, or the Kohen decides at the time of Hakravah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "V'Asahu Chatas" - the Goral (lottery) fixes one of the two goats of Yom Kipur to be a Chatas, but Shem (calling it a Chatas) does not (and the Kohen does not. The Kal va'Chomer does not address the Kohen making it a Chatas, e.g. through Avodah. There is no mention of the Kohen in this Beraisa in Kidushin and in Chulin, nor in the Meforshim, apparently this should be deleted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have made a Kal va'Chomer. Shem causes a bird to be a Chatas, but Goral does not. Goral causes a goat to be a Chatas, all the more so Shem should work!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Presumably, the case of Shem is like that of Goral. It is not at the time of purchase, nor at the time of Hakravah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It means that Goral does not work for birds even at the time of purchase or Hakravah, but Shem works at these times. Goral works for goats not at the time of purchase or Hakravah, all the more so Shem should work at these times!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If an Oni transgressed Tum'as Mikdash, and was Makdish money for a Kan, and became rich, and (later - Shitah deletes this) said "these coins are for my Chatas (ha'Of), and these are for my Olah," he adds to the Chatas money to buy an animal. He may not use the Olah money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, his Perush was not at the time of Hekdesh or Hakravah, and he may use only the Chatas money! (This shows that his Perush took effect.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Beraisa is mistaken. It says (or implies) that he was Mefaresh after he became rich, but R. Elazar taught in the name of R. Oshaya that if an Ashir brought a Korban Oni for Tum'as Mikdash, he was not Yotzei. (Therefore, surely, an Ashir cannot be Mefaresh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Beraisa should say that he was Mefaresh while he was still poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> (Since in any case we must fix the Beraisa,) we fix it to say that he was Mefaresh at the time of Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chana said that R. Oshaya taught that if an Ashir brought a Korban Oni for Tum'as Mikdash, he was Yotzei (just like our text of the Beraisa). How can he answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (text of Bach):</span> Instead of "(he was Makdish, became rich,) and then said... ," it should say "(he became rich,) and later was Makdish and said... ."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Metzora Oni brought a Korban Ashir, he was Yotzei. If a Metzora Ashir brought a Korban Oni, he was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Presumably, the same applies to every Oleh v'Yored,) This refutes R. Chana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Metzora is different, for it says "Zos". (An Ashir must bring this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also a Metzora Oni who brought a Korban Ashir should not be Yotzei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Toras" includes this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Toras" teaches that if a Metzora Oni brought Korban Ashir, he is Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if a Metzora Ashir brought Korban Oni, he was Yotzei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Zos" excludes this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn from Metzora (that if an Ashir brought Korban Oni for any Oleh v'Yored, he was not Yotzei)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Im Dal <i>Hu</i> v'Ein Yado Maseges" teaches that a Metzora Ashir is not Yotzei with Korban Oni, but an Ashir who transgressed Tum'as Mikdash is Yotzei with Korban Oni.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PAIRS THAT ARE REALLY EQUAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon) Suggestion:</span> The Torah (almost) always mentions lambs before. Perhaps this is because lambs are preferable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "(V'Hevi Korbano Se'iras Izim... ;) v'Im Keves Yavi Korbano l'Chatas" (in one place the Torah mentions goats first. This) teaches that they are equal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Torah (almost) always mentions Torim (Turim) before Yonim (doves). Perhaps this is because Torim are preferable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yonah Oh Sor l'Chatas" teaches that they are equal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Torah (almost) always mentions the father before the mother. Perhaps the Mitzvah to honor a father is greater than the Mitzvah to honor a mother!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ish Imo v'Aviv Tira'u" teaches that these Mitzvos are equal (regarding their reward);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, Chachamim taught that the Mitzvah to honor a father takes precedence (if she is still married to him), because also she is obligated to honor him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The same applies to learning Torah. If a son succeeded to learn from a Rebbi (Rambam - most of his Chachmah is from the Rebbi), his Rebbi has precedence (to return his lost object, to redeem him, to help him unload) over the father, because also the father must honor the Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> The Azarah cried out four times:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It screamed to expel Chofni and Pinchus, the sons of Eli, for they polluted the Heichal (through their sins);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It screamed for the gates to rise to allow Yochanan ben Nadvoi to enter and eat Kodshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He used to eat four Sa'im (almost 50 liters) of birds for dessert. (In Pesachim, the text reads 40 Sa'im. Rashi explains that he and his huge household consumed them);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>All his days, there was never Nosar (leftover Kodshim) in the Azarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It screamed for the gates to rise to allow Elishama ben Pikai, a Talmid of Pinchas, to enter and serve as Kohen Gadol. (He was a Tzadik in a family of strongarms);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>It screamed for the gates to rise to expel Yissachar of Kefar Barkai, who honored himself and disgraced Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did Yissachar do?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He would wrap his hands in silk during the Avodah (so they will not get dirty. This is a disgrace to the Avodah, and is a Chatzitzah that invalidates the Avodah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was his punishment?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The king Yanai and the queen were debating which are better, sheep or goats. They called Yissachar. Since he offers them every day, he should be an expert!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Yisachar:</span> If goats were better, they would be brought for the Tamid! He condescendingly waved his hand while saying this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yanai:</span> Since he waved his hand, his right hand will be cut off!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Yissachar bribed the officer (commanded to cut off his hand) to cut off the left hand instead. When Yanai found out, he ordered to cut off also his right hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Blessed is Hash-m, who gave Yisachar proper recompense (in this world)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Didn't Yisachar know our Mishnah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps lambs are (almost) always mentioned before goats because they are preferable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> .".. V'Im Keves Yavi" teaches that they are equal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> He did not know even Chumash! It says "Im Kesev... ; Im Ez" (our text - regarding Shelamim, the Torah shows no preference for either; Rashi's text - "v'Im Keves Yavi... ")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Chachamim increase Shalom in the world - "v'Chol Banayich Limudei Hash-m v'Rav Shelom Banayich";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We read Banayich (your children) like 'Bonyaich' (your builders, i.e. Chachamim).</p>
