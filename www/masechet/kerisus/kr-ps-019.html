<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES A <i>SAFEK YEDI'AH</i> SUFFICE TO BE <i>MECHALEK</i>? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish both contradict themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are two paths. One is Tamei (somewhere along it, a Mes is underground spanning the width of the path, so anyone who walks on the path becomes Tamei), and one is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a man walked on one path, and later on the other, and then entered the Mikdash, he is liable. (He is surely Tamei);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he walked on one path, entered the Mikdash, was sprinkled (with Mei Chatas, to become Vadai Tahor), walked on the other path, and entered the Mikdash, he is liable. (One of the times that he entered the Mikdash, he was Tamei);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Shimon exempts in this case;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>R. Shimon ben Yehudah says, R. Shimon exempts in every case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Shimon ben Yehudah exempt even in the first case? No matter which path is Tamei, he was Tamei when he entered the Mikdash!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, when he walked on the second path he forgot that he had walked on the first path, so he never knew that he was Vadai Tamei. (The two versions of R. Shimon's opinion argue as follows);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The first Tana (says that R. Shimon) holds that partial Yedi'ah is like Yedi'ah. R. Shimon ben Yehudah (says that R. Shimon) holds that partial Yedi'ah is not like Yedi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he walked on one path, entered the Mikdash, was sprinkled, walked on the other path and entered the Mikdash, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he liable? Each time he entered the Mikdash, he only knew (initially and forgot) that he was <i>Safek</i> Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> The Beraisa is R. Yishmael, who does not require Yedi'ah at the beginning. (If Rebbi says that Safek Yedi'ah is Mechalek for Chatas, there is no need to establish the Beraisa like the more extreme opinion of R. Yishmael!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is even like Chachamim. They consider Safek Yedi'ah to be like Yedi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We are thinking that R. Yochanan means that Chachamim always consider Safek Yedi'ah like Yedi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish both contradict themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> R. Yochanan does not contradict himself. Here, Chachamim consider Safek Yedi'ah like Yedi'ah, but not elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Tum'ah it says "v'Ne'elam Mimenu v'Hu Tamei" - one is liable for Yedi'ah that also has Safek;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding everything else, it says "Oh Hoda Elav Chataso." He is liable only for (Vadai) Yedi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We still have not answered why Reish Lakish establishes the Beraisa like R. Yishmael, and not like Rebbi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> He establishes it like R. Yishmael to teach that also R. Yishmael does not require Yedi'ah at the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learn this from a Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> It says twice "v'Ne'elam" to obligate one who (knew that he was Tamei but) forgot (that he was entering) the Mikdash, and one who (remembered the Mikdash but) forgot that he was Tamei. (He does not expound "v'Ne'elam" to require Yedi'ah at the beginning, so surely he does not require it!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Mishnah teaches that he does not expound a verse to require Yedi'ah at the beginning, but one might have thought that he has a tradition to require it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reish Lakish teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHICH SIN HE DID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> In the following cases, one brings a Chatas:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chelev and Nosar were in front of him. (He thought that both were permitted Shuman, and ate one,) and he does not know which he ate;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He thought that his wife was Tehorah and that he had relations with her. He found out that she was Nidah, and his sister was also in the house, he does not know with whom he had relations;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Yom Kipur was the day before or after Shabbos. He does not know on which day he did Melachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehoshua exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, they did not argue about one who did Melachah Bein ha'Shemashos. All agree that he is exempt, for perhaps half the Melachah was done during the day, and half at night;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about one who did Melachah during the day, but he does not know if it was Yom Kipur or Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They also argue about one who did Melachah but does not know which Melachah. R. Eliezer is Mechayev Chatas, and R. Yehoshua exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, R. Yehoshua exempts even from Asham Taluy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon and R. Shimon Shezuri say, all agree that if he is unsure about which action he did, but not about which Shem Melachah (e.g. he reaped oranges, but he is unsure from which tree), he brings a Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about when he is unsure which Shem Melachah he did (e.g. if he diced or reaped; alternatively, if he reaped oranges or dates). R. Eliezer is Mechayev Chatas, and R. Yehoshua exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah says, even if he intended to pick dates and picked grapes, or vice-versa, or even if he intended to pick black (dates) and picked white, or vice-versa, R. Eliezer is Mechayev Chatas, and R. Yehoshua exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) R. Shimon:</span> I cannot fathom how R. Yehoshua can exempt (one who does a different Isur than intended)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he is liable, what do we learn from "Asher Chata Bah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This exempts Mis'asek. (He intended for Heter, and did an Isur.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Gershom) R. Yehudah:</span> I cannot fathom how R. Yehoshua can exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon Shezuri:</span> If he is liable, what do we learn from "Asher Chata Bah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> This exempts Mis'asek (one who did not intend for this action).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> He is Chayav a Chatas either way, whether he ate Chelev or Nosar, whether he had relations with a Nidah or his sister, and whether he did Melachah on Yom Kipur or Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> "Asher Chata Bah" teaches that he must know which Aveirah he did.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Eliezer exclude from "Asher Chata Bah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes Mis'asek.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MIS'ASEK IS EXEMPT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of Mis'asek does "Asher Chata Bah" exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot say that he was Mis'asek in Chalavim or Arayos, for if so, he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> One who was Mis'asek in Chalavim (or other food) or Arayos is liable, for he got pleasure.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Tosfos):</span> We cannot say that he was Mis'asek (and did Melachah) on Shabbos, for a different source exempts this. The Torah forbids only "Meleches Machsheves" (one who accomplished his intention - Shemos 35:33)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> According to Rava, we can say that he intended to cut something detached (from the ground, and cut it), but really, it was attached.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> According to Abaye, we can say that he mistakenly thought that it is detached, and he intended to <i>lift</i> it, and detached it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi) Answer:</span> He was Mis'asek (and did Melachah) on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah forbids only Meleches Machsheves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava exempts if he intended to cut something detached, and mistakenly cut something else that was attached;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Abaye exempts if he intended to lift something detached, and he mistakenly lifted something attached. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If one intended to lift something detached and mistakenly detached (it; Rashi - something else), he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not intend to cut at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If he intended to cut something detached and accidentally detached, he is liable, for he intended to cut;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He is exempt, for he did not intend to cut something that is forbidden to cut.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN DOES R. ELIEZER EXEMPT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> They did not argue...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> You were meticulous to disprove me.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In response to what did he say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They said 'you exempt any Melachah Bein ha'Shemashos. If he (was in Reshus ha'Rabim, and) picked up an object (from Reshus ha'Yachid) Bein ha'Shemashos, he should be liable!' (The Melachah happens in a moment. We cannot say that half was during the day, and half at night. R. Gershom - they hold that Akirah is not part of the Melachah, only Hanachah. Alternatively, they discuss Makeh b'Patish, the final hammer blow.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi said, you were meticulous to disprove me.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he began during the day, and finished after nightfall! (Akirah is part of the Melachah. Really, he is exempt)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi means 'you were meticulous to disprove me. You failed.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi says that R. Eliezer exempts for the end of a Melachah (if the beginning was not on Shabbos). This is wrong!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If one weaves three stitches at the beginning, or adds one onto a (partially woven) garment, he is liable. (One is not liable for only one stitch. R. Eliezer is Mechayav because the last stitch complete the Shi'ur of what he began before Shabbos!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> R. Yosi's text of the Mishnah says that R. Eliezer obligates one who weaves three stitches at the beginning, or adds <i>two</i> onto a garment. (The Shi'ur to be liable is two stitches. R. Eliezer exempts for two at the beginning because they will not last, i.e. they will become undone.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>EXEMPTIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> R. Yehoshua exempts even from Asham Taluy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> R. Yehoshua exempts even from Asham Taluy. "Ki Secheta... v'Lo Yada" excludes one who knows that he sinned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> The verse explicitly obligates Asham Taluy for this! "V'Asah v'Lo Yada" means that he did (sin), but he does not know which sin he did!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is unsure whether he sinned at all, it is not clear whether he brings an Asham Taluy!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did he conclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If someone sinned, but does not know which sin he did; or, if he is unsure whether or not he sinned, he brings an Asham Taluy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana, who obligates one who does not know which sin he did?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Shimon, and he obligates also one who is unsure whether or not he sinned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon and R. Shimon Shezuri):</span> All agree... ("Asher Chata Bah" exempts Mis'asek).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> One who was Mis'asek in Chalavim and Arayos is liable, for he got pleasure;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who was Mis'asek on Shabbos is exempt, for this is not Meleches Machsheves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> The case of circumcision is like Mis'asek (and one is liable)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If Reuven had two babies to circumcise, one on Shabbos and one the next day, and he mistakenly circumcised the latter on Shabbos, he brings a Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehoshua exempts only because he erred when trying to do a Mitzvah, even though he did not do a Mitzvah. (Milah before eight days is not a Mitzvah.) He obligates one who is Mis'asek in Reshus (not a Mitzvah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Milah is different. Since Mekalkel (ruining) b'Chaburah (through wounding) is liable, also Mis'asek b'Chaburah is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah - Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Even if he intended to pick figs and (mistakenly) picked grapes, or to pick black and he picked white, or vice-versa, R. Eliezer is Mechayev Chatas, and R. Yehoshua exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though he is Mis'asek, R. Yehoshua exempts only because they are different Minim. If he picked the same kind that he intended, he would be Mechayev!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The case is, Ibed Melaket mi'Libo (he forgot what he originally intended to pick). He originally intended to pick grapes, then forgot and thought that he wanted to pick figs, and when he tried to pick figs, he accidentally picked grapes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer is Mechayev, for this was his original intent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua exempts. His original intent was fulfilled, but not what he tried to do (at the time).</p>
