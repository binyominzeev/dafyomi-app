<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE SHECHITAH OF A MUMAR (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yehoshafat did not separate himself from Achav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "I am like you. My nation is like your nation."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says also "my horses are like your horses." Clearly, he spoke only about war!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we learn from "(Achav) and Yehoshafat... sat... in the Goren of the entrance to the gate of Shomron."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Goren mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot simply mean a threshing floor. The gate of Shomron is not a threshing floor!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they sat like a Goren.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Sanhedrin sat as a semi-circle, so they could see each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> From Eliyahu we can support Rav Anan's law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "The Orvim (ravens) brought (Eliyahu) bread and meat" - the meat was from Achav's slaughterers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Shechitas Mumar is forbidden, but Hash-m gave special permission to Eliyahu.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What were the Orvim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> They were ravens.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rav Ada bar Minyomi):</span> Perhaps they were two men named Orev!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We find that this is a name -"they killed Orev at the rock of Orev"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Ravina):</span> It is unreasonable to say that both men had this name.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they are called Orvim because they come from Orev (like we find elsewhere)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "They captured from Yisrael a Na'arah, a minor" - if she is a Na'arah, she is not a minor!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Pedas):</span> She was a minor from Ne'uran.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, they would be called 'Orviyim'.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SHECHITAH OF A MUMAR IDOLATER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Beraisa supports Rav Anan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Anyone may slaughter, even a Kusi, Arel, even a Mumar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of the Arel?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If his brothers died through circumcision, he is a fully Kosher Yisrael!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he rejects the Mitzvah of circumcision.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa says 'even a Yisrael Mumar.' What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he is a Mumar to one (regular) Mitzvah, this is the same as a Mumar to circumcision, which was already taught!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he is a Mumar to idolatry. We learn that he may slaughter, like Rav Anan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Really, a Mumar to idolatry may not slaughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Anyone who admits to idolatry is like one that denies the whole Torah. Anyone who denies idolatry is like one that admits to the whole Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, the Seifa discusses a Mumar to eat Neveilah (for pleasure), like Rava taught (4a. One checks a knife, and the Mumar slaughters with it.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>KORBANOS OF A MUMAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "(One who will offer an Olah) from you" connotes only some of you. This excludes a Mumar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"From you" teaches that we distinguish only among you (Yisraelim), but not among other nations. (Any Nochri may volunteer an Olah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"From an animal" includes people who resemble animals'</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is the source that sinners of Yisrael may bring Korbanos, so that they will repent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We do not accept Korbanos from a Mumar, one who is Menasech (offers wine libations to idolatry), or one who publicly desecrates Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha uses "from you" to exclude a Mumar; and the middle clause permits sinners of Yisrael to bring Korbanos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Mumar to the whole Torah may not bring Korbanos. A Mumar to one Mitzvah may.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> A Mumar, a Menasech, or one who publicly desecrates Shabbos (may not bring Korbanos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of Mumar is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he is a Mumar to the whole Torah, the Reisha taught this!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If he is a Mumar to one Mitzvah, this is unlike the middle clause!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Seifa says that a Mumar who is Menasech or publicly desecrates Shabbos (may not bring Korbanos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A Mumar to idolatry is like a Mumar to the whole Torah. This refutes Rav Anan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A different source teaches that a Mumar may not bring Korbanos!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "From commoners" excludes a Mumar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Yosi says "(or became known to him his sin)" - one who sinned b'Shogeg (by mistake), and would not have sinned knowingly, he brings a Korban. One who would have sinned anyway does not bring a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Hamnuna):</span> They argue about one who wantonly eats Chelev (forbidden fats), and mistakenly consumed blood. (The first Tana exempts him from a Korban. R. Shimon obligates him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verses quoted in this Beraisa exempt a Mumar from a Chatas. "From you" disqualifies a Mumar from a voluntary Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We need both sources.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had we learned only that a Mumar is exempt from a Chatas, we would say that this is because he is not Kosher for atonement, but he may bring an Olah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Had we learned only that a Mumar may not bring Olos, we would say that this is because it is voluntary, but he may bring a Chatas, which is obligatory!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (On Amud Aleph, we said that "animal" refers to sinners.) Sometimes 'animal' alludes to people in a positive way!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Hash-m will save man and animals" refers to men who make themselves (humble) like animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, it says "man and animals", so the connotation is favorable. When it only says 'animal', it is derogatory.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Sometimes it says "man and animals", the connotation is derogatory!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"I will seed Beis Yisrael, the seed of man and the seed of animals".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the words are separated - "the seed of man" and "the seed of animals".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SHECHITAH OF A KUSI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Idi):</span> R. Gamliel and his Beis Din voted, and prohibited the Shechitah of Kusim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Perhaps that is only when a Yisrael did not supervise?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yakov bar Idi:</span> Such a question befits one who has not learned!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not necessary to teach that if he slaughtered unsupervised, it is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Zeira accept R. Yakov's answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer: (We learn from the following episode.):</span> R. Yochanan and R. Asi ate from the Shechitah of a Kusi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Zeira was astonished. Did they not hear of R. Gamliel's decree, or did they not accept it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He concluded that it cannot be that they did not hear it, for if so, they accidentally sinned by eating.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Hash-m does not allow a pitfall to come even through animals of Tzadikim, and all the more so through Tzadikim themselves!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rather, they heard the decree and disagreed.</p></div>
