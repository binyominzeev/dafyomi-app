<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN MIXTURES BECOME FORBIDDEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Dimi):</span> May one put a flask of salt near a flask of Kutach (a dip containing milk)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> No. (We will explain why.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Dimi):</span> May one put a flask of vinegar near a flask of Kutach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Yes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Kutach falls in vinegar, it will be Batel in the vinegar. If it falls in salt, it will be intact.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>A (slaughtered) bird fell into a jar of Kutach. R. Chinena brei d'Rava of Pashrunya permitted it (and the Kutach).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> He holds that Shmuel's law that salted foods transfer Ta'am like hot foods applies only to food too salty to be eaten. Kutach is not that salty.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The bird is permitted only if it was raw. If it was roasted, the outer later would have to be peeled off.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It there were cracks in the bird, or if it was seasoned, if would be forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>FORBIDDEN ABSORPTIONS OF BLOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one cut meat over bread (and juice fell onto the bread), the bread is forbidden (since it absorbed blood).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is only if the meat was red (i.e. not sufficiently roasted), and the juice penetrated to the other end of the bread, and the juice was thick. (If the juice was thin, it was not blood.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Two cases occurred. In one, Shmuel fed the bread to a dog. In another, Rav Huna gave it to his servant.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Rav Huna permits it, he could eat it himself. If not, he may not feed it to his servant!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He permits it. He could not eat it himself because he was very particular.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rava ate it. He considered the juice to be the best part of the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> One may not put a Kli under roasting meat (to collect the juice) as long as there is redness in the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know when the redness is gone?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra):</span> When smoke comes up (from the meat; others explain, from the coals), it is gone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> Perhaps only the bottom of the meat facing the coals is roasted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Rather, one puts a clump of salt on the meat and a clump in the Kli (this causes the blood to collect at the bottom);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">112b----------------------------------------112b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may then pour off the fat at the top (without the blood).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> Shmuel forbids bread over which (even fully roasted) meat was cut. Even meat without any redness emits juice. Why does he permit it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The pressure of the knife causes blood to exude that would not exude through roasting.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SALTING THINGS TOGETHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If fish and fowl were salted together, they (the fish) are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they were salted in a Kli without holes, even if only birds were salted, they would be forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they were salted in a Kli with holes, even fish and birds should be permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, the Kli has holes. Since fish have soft skin, they emit all their brine before the birds emit their blood, and the fish absorb the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mari bar Rachel):</span> If Kosher and Terefah meat were salted together, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Beraisa):</span> "Ha'Teme'im" forbids the brine (of Sheratzim), their soup (the water in which they were cooked), and their Kipah (spices and shredded meat that accumulate at the bottom of the pot. The Kosher meat absorbed forbidden brine and soup.)</p></div>
