<p class="dedicationbox">CHULIN 101 (1 Adar II) - dedicated in memory of Mordecai (Marcus) ben Elimelech Shmuel Kornfeld, who perished in the Holocaust along with most of his family. His Yahrzeit is observed on 1 Adar. May his death and the deaths of the other Kedoshim of the Holocaust atone for us like Korbanos. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DOUBLE LIABILITY FOR EATING THE GID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> One who eats the Gid ha'Nasheh of a Tamei animal is lashed twice (two sets of lashes);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon says, he is not lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> No matter how R. Shimon holds, he should obligate at least once!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he holds that Isur Chal Al Isur, he should obligate lashes for eating from a Tamei animal, and for eating a Gid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he holds Ein Isur Chal Al Isur, he should obligate lashes for the first Isur, i.e. a Tamei animal!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he holds that the Gid has no taste (so the Isur Tamei does not apply), he should obligate for eating a Gid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Indeed, he holds that the Gid has no taste;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Isur Gid does not apply, since it says "therefore Bnei Yisrael do not eat Gid ha'Nasheh." The Isur applies only when the rest of the meat is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one eats Gid ha'Nasheh of a Nevelah, R. Meir obligates him twice, and Chachamim obligate him once.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim agree that for eating the Gid of an Olah or of Shor ha'Niskal (an ox sentenced to be stoned), he is lashed twice. (The Gemara will explain why.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>KOLEL ISURIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim hold Ein Isur Chal Al Isur, even if the new Isur is Kolel (it also forbids things that were otherwise permitted, e.g. when an animal becomes Nevelah, all the meat (not just the Gid) becomes forbidden);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, if the Kolel Isur is Chamur (more severe than the first Isur, e.g. one may not benefit from an Olah or Shor ha'Niskal), it takes effect;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Like whom is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is like R. Yosi ha'Gelili;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Tamei (person) ate Kodshim, whether the Kodshim were Tahor or Tamei, he is Chayav (Kares if he was Mezid, and Chatas if he was Shogeg);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Gelili says, he is liable only if he ate Tahor Kodshim, but not if they were Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Even when he eats Tahor Kodshim, he makes them Tamei once he touches them! (How can you distinguish the cases?!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Seemingly, R. Yosi ha'Gelili is refuted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If the person became Tamei before the Kodshim became Tamei, all agree that he is liable, for the Isur Kares (for a Tamei to eat Kodshim) came first;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue when the Kodshim became Tamei before the person.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim hold that since a Kolel Isur forbids things that were otherwise permitted (when he becomes Tamei, he becomes forbidden to Tahor Kodshim), it also takes effect on what was already forbidden (Tamei Kodshim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Gelili disagrees, for Ein Isur Chal Al Isur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, R. Yosi ha'Gelili holds that Ein Isur Kolel Chal Al Isur if the old Isur is more severe. Would he say so if the new Isur is Chamur?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>For a Tamei to eat Kodshim is Chamur, since he is Chayav Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He can say that the Isur to eat Tamei Kodshim is Chamur, since this can never be permitted through immersion. (A Tamei person can become Tahor, but Tamei food cannot.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">101b----------------------------------------101b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yosi ha'Gelili really hold that Ein Isur Kolel Chal Al Isur?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> "It is Shabbos", "it is Yom Kipur" teach that if Yom Kipur falls on Shabbos and one did Melachah (b'Shogeg), he brings a Chatas for each;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva says, he brings only one Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ravin sent a message to Bavel that the opinions must be switched.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yitzchak bar Yakov):</span> According to R. Yosi ha'Gelili (after the opinions are switched), if one did Melachah, unaware that it was Shabbos but knowing that it was Yom Kipur, he is liable. If he knew that it was Shabbos but forgot that it was Yom Kipur, he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Shabbos is fixed. Yom Kipur is determined by Beis Din (when they declare the new month), so it is considered to come later.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Even so, the Isurim take effect at the same moment!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rav Yitzchak bar Yakov's teaching was not said about Yom Kipur that (truly) falls on Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it refers to an episode in which Nochrim forbade keeping Yom Kipur;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since Yisre'elim could not observe Yom Kipur, Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael enacted that people conduct on a Shabbos with the restrictions of Yom Kipur (so Yom Kipur would not be forgotten. Rav Yitzchak exempts one who did Melachah, forgetting that the day should be treated like Yom Kipur.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ramban) Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rav Yitzchak's teaching was mistaken.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Ravin's message to switch the opinions was only a ruse.) Nochrim had decreed against Mitzvos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(In Eretz Yisrael, they made Thursday Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kipur would be on Shabbos.) To secretly inform the community in Bavel, Ravin sent the (altered) Beraisa in which R. Akiva discusses Yom Kipur falling on Shabbos (the Halachah usually follows R. Akiva. Rav Yitzchak (and Abaye) did not understand this, so he explained the Beraisa.) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Ravin, and everyone who came from Eretz Yisrael to Bavel agreed with Rava.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OTHER ISURIM THAT APPLY TO TAMEI ANIMALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> The Gid was forbidden to Yakov's children...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> The Torah does not forbid Bnei Yakov to eat the Gid, rather, "Bnei Yisrael." They are not called Bnei Yisrael until the Torah was given at Sinai!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, the Mitzvah was given at Sinai. The Torah wrote it in the appropriate place, to teach why we don't eat it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> It says "Bnei Yisrael carried their father Yakov." (They are called Bnei Yisrael before Sinai!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After Hash-m called Yakov by the name Yisrael, his children are called Bnei Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Chachamim should admit that after that (when they are called Bnei Yisrael), the Gid was forbidden to them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The Torah was not given piecemeal!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since this was not the time that the Torah was given, nor was it the time when Yakov's Gid was wounded (the source of the Mitzvah), the Mitzvah did not begin to apply then (when they were first called Bnei Yisrael).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>EVER MIN HA'CHAI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah and R. Elazar):</span> The Isur of Ever Min ha'Chai (a limb of a living animal) applies to Behemos, Chayos and birds, both Tehorim and Teme'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, it applies only to Tehorim.</p></div>
