<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah, against Reish Lakish - Mishnah #1):</span> To break a Tamei oven to be Metaher it, one cuts it into three parts, scrapes off the plaster and puts it on the ground (i.e. not on its supports);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Meir says, he need not scrape off the plaster, nor put it on the ground;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It suffices to break off (part of the oven itself) until it is less than four Tefachim tall.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> After making it less than four, why is it Tahor? The plaster keeps it strong!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Rather than ask from R. Meir, you should support Reish Lakish from Chachamim, who say that he scrapes off the plaster and puts it on the ground!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Rather, to be Metaher a Tamei oven, all agree that one cuts it into three parts, scrapes off the plaster and puts it on ground;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The same must be done to prevent an oven from receiving Tum'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir says, he need not scrape off the plaster, nor put it on the ground - it suffices to make it less than four Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> He cuts it into three parts...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #2 - R. Meir):</span> A complete oven of four Tefachim is Mekabel Tum'ah, or a broken oven is Mekabel Tum'ah if four Tefachim remain;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim say, this applies to a big oven. A small oven of any size receives Tum'ah once it is finished;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A broken oven receives Tum'ah if the majority remains.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim say "a small oven of any size." How big must it be?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> It must be one Tefach, for people make such ovens.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of contradiction:</span> Chachamim agree that a broken big oven receives Tum'ah only if four Tefachim remain;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>In Mishnah #1, they require cutting it into three parts. If it were cut into two, the majority would be Tamei even if it is less than 4 Tefachim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When it is cut widthwise (i.e. perpendicular to the ground, it does not rest so well) it is Tamei only if four Tefachim remain. When it is cut lengthwise (parallel to the ground, the top piece rests on the bottom piece) it is Tamei if the majority remains (even if it is less than four).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2):</span> A broken oven receives Tum'ah if the majority remains.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The majority of a one Tefach oven is useless!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> This clause of the Mishnah applies only to big ovens.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim agreed to R. Meir that for a big oven, four Tefachim must remain!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That (the Mishnah) refers to an oven of nine (i.e. more than eight; the majority must remain). That (Chachamim say that four must remain) refers to an oven of seven (i.e. less than eight).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TEARING SKIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Huna):</span> Tearing the majority of a cloak is Metaher it even if a resulting piece is large enough to make a turban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Skin is more important. If a piece this size remains, it is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Skin has the same law as a cloak.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If skin is Tamei Midras:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the owner planned to cut it into straps or shoes, once he starts cutting it, it is Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, it is Tahor only when he cuts it into pieces less than five (by five) Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> When he makes it this small, it is Tahor (even though this is enough to make a turban)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he needs it for a seat cover. (Five by five suffices.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MEAT LEFT ON SKIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there is a k'Zayis of (Nevelah) meat on skin, one who touches a strand coming out of the skin or a hair opposite the meat becomes Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yishmael says, if two half k'Zeisim of meat are on it, it has Tum'ah Masa, but not Maga. (It is Metamei one who carries or moves it, but not one who touches it);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Akiva says, it does not have Tum'ah Masa nor Maga.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva admits that if two half k'Zeisim of Nevelah are stuck on a chip of wood, it has Tum'ah Masa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He argues when the pieces of meat are on skin, for they are Batel to the skin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara - Ula citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Tana'im hold that a k'Zayis of meat on skin is Tamei only if it is there due to a Chayah's bite;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it came off a flayer's knife, it is Batel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> Would R. Yochanan say that even a quarter Kav (some say - balance pan's) worth of meat is Batel? Is even a sifter's worth Batel?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> Yes, he would.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> If R. Yochanan himself would tell me so, I would not heed him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Oshaya repeated this dialogue in front of R. Ami.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> Rav Nachman should not take R. Yochanan's teachings so lightly!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> This is only if the meat is on the skin due to a Chayah's bite. If it came off a flayer's knife, it is Batel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Oshaya:</span> Ula said that R. Yochanan taught this concerning the Reisha!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> I would not believe anyone to say that R. Yochanan taught this concerning the Reisha!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Ravin and all Chachamim who came from Eretz Yisrael (to Bavel) said that R. Yochanan taught this concerning the Reisha.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We never answered the question! (Does R. Yochanan hold that there is no limit to how much meat can be Batel?!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We answer like Rav Papa taught (elsewhere). The case is, the meat is spread out very thinly. (No one would bother to gather it.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This is like R. Yochanan taught elsewhere;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yishmael (above) teaches the same principle as R. Dosa ben Hurkanus:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Dosa):</span> If something that is Metamei b'Ohel was divided into two parts (neither has a Shi'ur for Tum'as Ohel by itself) and they were brought into a house, the house is Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim say, the house is Tamei.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva said this only regarding skin, for the meat is Batel. Otherwise, he holds like Chachamim;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> R. Akiva means that only what has Tum'as Maga from every side (i.e. even if one touches the skin opposite them) has Tum'as Masa.</p></div>
