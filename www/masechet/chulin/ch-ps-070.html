<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> When an animal gives birth for the first time, one may cut off the limbs of the child and cast them to the dogs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One may pile up the limbs before casting them to the dogs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to Rav Huna, the child is Mekudash retroactively once the majority is in front of us. We should need to bury the limbs!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Mishnah permits only casting each limb to the dogs after it is cut, so there is never a majority in front of us. (He may not cut much faster than the dogs eat.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If the majority of the fetus comes out, it must be buried. The next child of the mother is not a Bechor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana should have distinguished between more similar cases! He should require casting each limb to the dogs after it is cut, and require burying them if they are stored up and there is a majority in front of us!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this is what the Tana means!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may cast each limb to the dogs after it is cut, but if they are stored up (and there is a majority in front of us), it is as if the majority came out at once, and they must be buried.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Is a limb judged based on its majority?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rava ask about?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If a minority of a limb came out, and this helps comprise a majority of the child, do we view it as if this limb did not leave at all (so a majority has not been born), or does the part that left join to make a majority that was born?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That would be obvious. The fact that the majority of this limb is inside does not prevail over the fact that the majority was born.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asked about the majority of a limb that came out, and this helps comprise exactly half of the child. Do we view it as if the entire limb came out (so a majority has been born)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If the majority came out, it must be buried.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If indeed the majority came out, this is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it discusses Rava's case. (The Mishnah considers this a majority.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The case is, a minority of a limb came out, and this helps comprise a majority of the child;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that the fact that the majority of this limb is inside does not prevail over the fact that the majority was born.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (Rava):</span> Is the child Kodesh if it left the womb wrapped (by people) in moss, or in a garment, or in its fetal sac?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It is normal to leave in its fetal sac. Clearly this does not inhibit the Kedushah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, it was wrapped in a fetal sac of another fetus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it was wrapped in someone's hands (Rashi; Tosfos - in a female fetus) when it came out, is it Kodesh?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did it come out?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If the head left first, it became Kodesh once the head left, before the person held it!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> If the female's head left first, the male is surely not a Bechor!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the feet left first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Sheretz (stuck its mouth in the womb and) swallowed the fetus and removed it from the womb, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is precisely like if it was wrapped when it left. We already asked this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if a Sheretz swallowed the fetus, took it from the womb, returned it, spit it out, and then the fetus left the womb, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The wombs of two animals (A and B) that had not yet given birth were stuck together. A male fetus left A's womb and entered B's womb. (Later, the animals were separated, and the child came out of B.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Clearly, the child is a Bechor, and the next child of A is not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Does the child also exempt B's first child from being considered a Bechor (since A's child was the first to leave B's womb)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>These questions are unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha):</span> If the walls of the womb opened wide and the child was born without touching them, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the airspace of the womb is Mekadesh, it is a Bechor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it must touch the womb to become Mekudash, it is Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> If the walls of the womb were uprooted (and the child was born), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If they are not there, the child is not Peter Rechem (the first to leave the womb)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the womb recessed inside the mother;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Is the womb Mekadesh only when in it is in its proper place, or even when not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If the inner walls of the womb fell off, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> You can derive the answer to your question from my question.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If most of the walls of the womb are intact, and the fetus left through an area where they had fallen; or, if most of the walls of the womb had fallen, and the fetus left through an area where they were intact, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The question is only when part of the wall remains. If the entire inner wall is gone, the child is Chulin.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TUM'AH OF A DEAD FETUS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a shepherd touched a dead fetus inside an animal, his hand is Tahor, whether the animal is Tahor or Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Gelili says, if the animal is Tamei, his hand is Tamei. If the animal is Tahor, his hand is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> What is the first Tana's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> He learns from a Kal va'Chomer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the mother can permit a fetus (even if it is dead) to be eaten (if it was inside when she was slaughtered), all the more she is Metaher it (from Tum'as Nevelah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This Kal va'Chomer does not apply to a Tamei animal! (It may not be eaten.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "When an animal will die" refers to a Tamei animal. "That you may eat" refers to a Tahor animal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah equates the laws of Tahor and Tamei animals. Just like a fetus in a Tahor animal is not Tamei, also in a Tamei animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yosi ha'Gelili's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak):</span> "Anything that walks on the soles of its feet in every Chayah that walks... " - things that walk on their soles (have uncloven hooves) inside [the womb of] an animal are Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, a fetus with uncloven hooves inside a cow should be Tamei, for it walks on its soles!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> What walks on its soles "in every Chayah that walks on four" is Tamei. A cow walks on eight (since each hoof is split).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, a calf (fetus) inside a camel should not be Tamei, for it walks on eight and is inside something that walks on four!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "That walks... and all that walks" includes a calf in a camel. (It is Tamei.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A fetus (of a Tahor animal) with uncloven hooves inside a Tahor mother with uncloven hooves should be Tamei, for it walks on four and it is inside something that walks on four!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Chisda's Kal va'Chomer is Metaher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Achdevoy bar R. Ami):</span> A pig inside a pig should not be Tamei, for it walks on eight! (Its hooves are split.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak) Question:</span> "If one will touch anything Tamei, or the Nevelah of a Tamei Chayah (or Tamei Behemah or Tamei Sheretz)" - are Nevelos only of Tamei animals Tamei, but not of Tahor animals?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the verse teaches that a (dead) fetus in a Tamei animal is Tamei, but one inside a Tahor animal it is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rav Nachman learn from R. Yitzchak's verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Without R. Yitzchak's verse, one might have thought that Rav Nachman's verse teaches only Rebbi's law (that one who became Tamei brings a Korban only if he entered the Mikdash or ate Kodshim), but fetuses of Tamei animals are Tahor, since they are equated to Tahor animals;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yitzchak's verse teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CARCASSES OF CHAYOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yonason):</span> The Torah teaches that Nevelos of (Tahor or Tamei species of) Behemos are Tamei, and also of Tamei Chayos;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Nevelos of Tahor Chayos are Tamei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ben Azai):</span> We learn from "anything that goes on its soles, in every Chayah that goes."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yonason):</span> It says "in every Chayah", not 'every Chayah'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Ben Azai:</span> How did R. Yishmael explain?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yonason:</span> "When an animal will die" refers to a Tamei animal. "That you may eat" refers to a Tahor animal;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We learned that Tahor and Tamei Chayos are included in 'Behemah', and that Tahor and Tamei Behemos are included in 'Chayah'.</p></div>
