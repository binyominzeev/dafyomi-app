<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ACQUIRING THE YIELD OF A DOVECOTE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this necessary?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not needed to acquire them. He can acquire through Chalipin!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is to permit them on Yom Tov (so they will not be Muktzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It suffices to say (before Yom Tov) "I will take this one and this one"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The mother had never left the eggs from the moment she laid them until Levi sold them, so his Chatzer never acquired for him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel instructed Levi to hit the nest, so the mother will jump up, allowing Levi to acquire, so he can transfer ownership of them to Rav Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE REWARD OF THE MITZVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not take a mother on her young even to be Metaher a Metzora.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Regarding Shilu'ach ha'Kan, an easy Mitzvah that entails a loss of about an Isar (the value of the mother), it says "Lema'an Yitav Lach v'Ha'arachta Yamim." All the more so this applies to difficult Mitzvos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Yakov):</span> Every Mitzvah for which the Torah writes its reward, it is (also) rewarded by Techiyas ha'Mesim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says about honoring parents "Lema'an Ya'arichun Yamecha u'Lema'an Yitav Lach";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It says about Shilu'ach ha'Kan "Lema'an Yitav Lach v'Ha'arachta Yamim."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a man asked his son to bring to him eggs from the top of a building, and the son (sent the mother and) took the eggs and died on his way down, where is the length of days and goodness that the Torah promises for these two Mitzvos?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lema'an Ya'arichun Yamecha" must refer to the world (to come) that is eternal;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"U'Lema'an Yitav Lach" refers to the world (to come) that is all good.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps (the reward is in this world, therefore) such an event would never occur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yakov saw such an event.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the son had sinful thoughts at the time (and was punished for them)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m does not punish (Yisrael) for thoughts, only for sinful actions.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the son had idolatrous thoughts at the time! (Yisrael are punished for thoughts of idolatry.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> "Lema'an Tefos Es Beis Yisrael b'Libam" refers to thoughts of idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yakov reasons that if the reward for Mitzvos were in this world, it should have saved him from having these thoughts that caused his death;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rather, the reward for Mitzvos must be in the world to come.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar taught that harm will not befall someone on the way to do a Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He can be harmed on the way back.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Elazar taught that harm will not befall someone on the way to do a Mitzvah or on the way back!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He went down a rickety ladder. The above law does not apply to dangerous situations;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Shmuel said "Eich Elech v'Shama Sha'ul va'Haragani" (he was concerned for danger, even though Hash-m told him to anoint David, which is a Mitzvah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Had Acher (the Tana Elisha ben Avuya) expounded these verses like his grandson R. Yakov, he would not have become a heretic.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did he see that broke his faith?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He saw an incident like R. Yakov saw.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He saw the tongue of R. Chutzpis the translator (who was among the ten great Chachamim killed by Rome) in a wasteheap;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Acher was appalled that the tongue that spoke Torah so wondrously was not protected from such an end;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He did not know that "Lema'an Ya'arichun Yomecha" refers to the world that is eternal, and "u'Lma'an Yitav Lach" refers the world that is all good.</p></div>
