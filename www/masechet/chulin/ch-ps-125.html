<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MEAT INSIDE BONES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who touches a femur of a Mes or Kodshim, whether or not there is a hole in it, becomes Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who touches a femur of a Nevelah or Sheretz becomes Tamei only if there is a hole of in it, even arbitrarily small.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that it is even Metamei b'Masa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "One who touches... and one who carries" teaches that whatever has Tum'as Maga has Tum'as Masa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> A femur of a Mes has only Tum'as Maga, but not Tum'as Ohel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there is a k'Zayis of flesh on the bone, it should also be Metamei b'Ohel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is not a k'Zayis of flesh on the bone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there is a k'Zayis of marrow inside, the Tum'ah should exude and be Metamei b'Ohel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is not a k'Zayis of marrow inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we say that marrow inside nourishes meat outside, even if there is less than a k'Zayis of marrow inside (Tosfos; Rashi - there is no marrow inside, since marrow could grow again, and then it could help meat grow outside), we should consider the bone like a proper limb (which is Metamei b'Ohel)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah brei d'R. Chiya):</span> Our Mishnah teaches that marrow inside does not nourish meat outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there is not a k'Zayis of meat (or marrow), why is it Tamei regarding Kodshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Reisha (Tum'as Mes) discusses when there is not a k'Zayis of marrow. The Seifa (Kodshim) discusses when there is a k'Zayis. Each teaches a Chidush;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Reisha teaches that marrow inside does not nourish meat outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Seifa teaches that bones that held Nosar are Tamei (mid'Rabanan).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Mari):</span> Bones of Kodshim that once held Nosar are Tamei, because they once held something forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Regarding Nevelah, even if there is a k'Zayis of marrow, a bone is Tamei only if it has a hole.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1A (Abaye):</span> (The cases in the Mishnah are like above, but) marrow inside does nourish meat outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The intention is that the bone was scraped or planed, not cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If a femur was cut lengthwise, it is Tamei (for the marrow still nourishes meat outside). If it was cut widthwise, it is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A way to remember this is a date tree. (If one cuts it lengthwise (from the ground up), it will live. If it is cut widthwise, it will die.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> The entire Mishnah discusses when there is a k'Zayis of marrow inside. Marrow inside does nourish meat outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Tum'as Mes, the Mishnah says that it has Tum'as Maga, i.e. Tum'as Ohel. (Below (2:a), we show that a Tana equates these.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If marrow nourishes meat outside, regarding Nevelah and Sheratzim, the bone should be Tamei like a limb, even if there is no hole!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Binyamin bar Gidal):</span> The case is, the marrow is dry (it cannot nourish meat outside).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Tum'as Mes, the Tum'ah pierces (goes straight through) the bone;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding Nevelah, since dry marrow cannot nourish meat outside, it is not Tamei like a limb;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is only Tamei if there is a hole.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IS TOWERING LIKE TOUCHING?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (R. Avin - Mishnah):</span> If one touches a half-k'Zayis (of Tum'as Mes) and towers over (or is towered over by) another half-k'Zayis, he is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We understand this if Tum'as Ohel is just like Tum'as Maga.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Tum'as Ohel is not like Tum'as Maga, why do the half-k'Zeisim join?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Tum'os of the same name (type) join up. Tum'os of different names do not join.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> If Tum'as Ohel is like Tum'as Maga, the half-k'Zeisim should join also in the Seifa (but they do not)!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">125b----------------------------------------125b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If one touches a half-k'Zayis (of Tum'as Mes) and is under a common roof with a half-k'Zayis, he is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution (R. Zeira):</span> The Mishnah discusses Tum'ah between two chests. (There is not a Tefach in between. Only) in such a case, Tum'as Ohel is like touching. (This refutes the support for R. Yochanan, who said that normal towering is like touching.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana considers towering like touching?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Yosi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> A spoon full of Rekev (dust of a decayed Mes) has Tum'as Maga, Masa and Ohel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, it has Tum'as Masa and Ohel. One moves or towers over the entire amount.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>However, how can it be Metamei through Maga? One cannot touch the full amount! (It is not connected.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that Maga refers to Ohel. The Tana calls it Maga.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It lists Tum'as Maga and Ohel!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Towering less than a Tefach above the Tum'ah is like Maga. Towering more than a Tefach above the Tum'ah is not like Maga.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Also towering more than a Tefach above the Tum'ah is like Maga.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What type of Ohel is not like Maga?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Being under a common roof with Tum'ah is unlike Maga.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>COVERED TUM'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I learn from a Mishnah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> If (interwoven) bed ropes or poles separate between a house and the second story, they block Tum'as Mes from passing from one to the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the ropes (or poles) were stretched in the air over a Mes, one who touches (puts his hand) over a rope is Tahor. One who touches (over the Mes) in the airspace between the ropes is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the ropes are less than a Tefach over the Mes, even over the ropes should be Tamei, just like Tum'ah pierces through the clothing on a Mes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the ropes are more than a Tefach over the Mes, and the Tana calls this Maga.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> Really, the ropes are less than a Tefach over the Mes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is unlike clothing on a Mes. One is Mevatel clothing on a Mes to the Mes (he decides to leave it on permanently), but one is not Mevatel the ropes!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, it should be like covered Tum'ah (of Mes, with less than a Tefach between the Tum'ah and the covering), which pierces through the covering!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi holds that covered Tum'ah does not pierce the covering.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to say this? (The answer finishes on 126a.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If a cupboard is a Tefach deep, but the opening is less than a Tefach:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Tum'ah is in the cupboard, (everything in) the house is Tamei. If Tum'ah is in the house, (everything in) the cupboard is Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is because it is the nature of Tum'ah to leave, but it is not the nature of Tum'ah to enter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yosi says, the house is Tahor, because the Tum'ah might leave less than a k'Zayis at a time, or it might be burned before it leaves.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If the cupboard is in the doorway, facing out:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If Tum'ah is in the cupboard, the house is Tahor. If Tum'ah is in the house, the cupboard is Tahor.</p></div>
