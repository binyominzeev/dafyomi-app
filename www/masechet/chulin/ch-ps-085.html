<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHO HAS THE MITZVAH OF SHOFAR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> Teki'as Shofar in the Gevulim disproves this. We do not blow on Shabbos even for a Vadai (definite) Mitzvah, but we do blow on Yom Tov for a Safek!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of a Safek Mitzvah of Shofar?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We are not sure which day is (mid'Oraisa) Rosh Hashanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Teki'as Shofar overrides Vadai Yom Tov. All the more so, it overrides Safek Yom Tov!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Safek is a Tumtum (Safek male. Perhaps (s)he is a female, and she is exempt.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This is not difficult for R. Yosi, for he permits women to perform Teki'as Shofar (and all other Mitzvos that apply only at certain times);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Bnei Yisrael do Semichah (lean full weight on the neck of the Korban). Benos Yisrael do not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi and R. Shimon say, Benos Yisrael may do Semichah if they want.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Even though Chachamim forbid women to sound a Shofar on Yom Tov, their question is invalid!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Teki'as Shofar overrides Shabbos in the Mikdash (therefore, a Safek overrides Yom Tov). We cannot learn to Kisuy ha'Dam, for this never overrides Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Beraisa (R. Elazar Hakapar Beribi):</span> Milah does not apply on Yom Tov night...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that Milah applies on other nights!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Elazar asks that Milah applies only during the day, but Kisuy is also at night, so one cannot learn from Milah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> R. Chiya said that he one cannot challenge R. Yosi's Kal va'Chomer. R. Elazar Hakapar challenged it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHECHITAH THAT DOES NOT PERMIT THE MEAT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> The Mitzvah to cover the blood applies even in the following cases:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The animal was found to be Terefah; it was slaughtered for idolatry; Chulin b'Azarah (Chulin slaughtered in the Mikdash); Shechutei Chutz; the animal had been sentenced to be stoned (e.g. for killing a person);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, there is no Mitzvah in these cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Kisuy does not apply if the animal became a Nevelah, or if Nechirah or Akirah was done (the Simanim were cut lengthwise or uprooted, and not slaughtered).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Regarding Oso v'Es Beno, Rebbi holds like R. Meir (that Shechitah that does not permit the meat is considered Shechitah), therefore the Mishnah attributes this opinion to 'Chachamim';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Kisuy ha'Dam, Rebbi holds like R. Shimon (that invalid Shechitah is not considered Shechitah), therefore the Mishnah attributes this opinion to 'Chachamim'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason regarding Oso v'Es Beno?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> He learns a Gezerah Shavah "Shechitah-Shechitah" from Shechutei Chutz. Just like there, it is considered Shechitah (even though the animal is forbidden), also regarding Oso v'Es Beno.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's reason regarding Oso v'Es Beno?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Mani bar Patish):</span> He learns a Gezerah Shavah from "Tavo'ach Tevach" (written concerning the meal prepared for Yosef's brothers). Kisuy applies only for such a Shechitah, i.e. one that permits the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Meir argue?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Regarding Oso v'Es Beno it says "Sishchatu".) It is better to learn from (another form of) the same word, and not from a different word (Tevichah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We can learn a Gezerah Shavah from a different word!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> A Gezeirah Shavah "v'Shav ha'Kohen u'Va ha'Kohen" teaches that the law (of a house with Tzara'as) when the Kohen (first) returns is the same like when he comes (another week later.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can learn a Gezerah Shavah from a different word only if it cannot be learned from the same word. Here, it can be learned from the same word.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Shimon learn like R. Meir, from Shechutei Chutz?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to learn Chulin from Chulin than from Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir argues, because Oso v'Es Beno applies also to Kodshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is why Rebbi holds like R. Meir regarding Oso v'Es Beno.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is R. Meir's reason regarding Kisuy ha'Dam?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> He learns a Gezerah Shavah "Shefichah-Shefichah" from Shechutei Chutz. Just like there, it is considered Shechitah (even though the animal is forbidden), also regarding Kisuy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon argues, because it says "that will be eaten".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir says that this teaches that Kisuy does not apply to Tamei birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon counters that just like "that will be eaten" excludes Tamei birds, it also excludes Terefah birds (and all other invalid slaughters)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>This is why Rebbi holds like R. Shimon regarding Kisuy ha'Dam.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHERE R. MEIR AND R. SHIMON AGREE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> R. Meir agrees that an invalid Shechitah does not permit the meat. R. Shimon agrees that an invalid Shechitah is Metaher (from Tum'as Nevelah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, Shechitah of a Terefah does not permit the meat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Aba must teach that Shechitah of a Terefah does not permit a living nine-month (i.e. viable) fetus inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since R. Meir considers Pasul Shechitah to be Shechitah, it permits the fetus. R. Aba teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir requires Shechitah even for a Ben Peku'ah (found inside a Kosher slaughtered mother)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the law is obvious according to R. Meir. R. Aba teaches that Rebbi admits in this case.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi considers Pasul Shechitah to be Shechitah, like R. Meir. He holds like Chachamim, that Kosher Shechitah is Metaher (and permits) a Ben Peku'ah inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One might have thought that Shechitah of the mother permits the child, even if the mother is Terefah. R. Aba teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> R. Shimon admits that Pasul Shechitah is Metaher from Tum'as Nevelah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "When will die from an animal" teaches that some animals are Metamei (like a Nevelah), and others do not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A slaughtered Terefah is not Metamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Aba must teach about a Chulin Terefah slaughtered in the Mikdash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If a Chulin Terefah was slaughtered in the Mikdash, one may benefit from the carcass;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim forbid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One might have thought that since Chachamim permit benefit from the carcass, it is as if it was not slaughtered at all. R. Aba teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> May we infer that R. Shimon forbids Chulin b'Azarah mid'Oraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Chulin Behemos slaughtered in the Azarah must be burned. The same applies to Chayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If a Behemah becomes forbidden mid'Oraisa, it is reasonable to decree the same for a Chayah. (Rashi - really, also a Chayah also becomes forbidden mid'Oraisa.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>However, if a Chulin Behemah is forbidden only mid'Rabanan, this would be a decree, lest people will eat Kodshim outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>It is unreasonable to forbid a Chayah (due to a Behemah). That is a decree due to a decree!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SHECHITAH FOR THE SAKE OF THE BLOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A moth fell into R. Chiya's flax (which was soaking in water). He wanted to chase it out with blood. Rebbi told him to slaughter a bird over the water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one slaughters (a bird or Chayah) only for the sake of the blood, he must cover the blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The only solution is to do Nechirah or Akirah (instead of Shechitah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Dimi):</span> Rebbi told him to make the bird a Terefah before slaughtering it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Dimi):</span> Rebbi told him to do Nechirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Version #1, why didn't he say to do Nechirah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rebbi holds that the Torah does not require Shechitah of birds. Nechirah suffices (so also Nechirah obligates Kisuy)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "Like I commanded you" teaches that Moshe received laws of slaughtering the Veshet, the Kaneh, the majority of one Siman of a bird, the majority of both Simanim of an animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi taught a bigger Chidush;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that Nechirah is exempt from Kisuy ha'Dam, for it is not Shechitah, but one must cover the blood of a slaughtered Terefah. He teaches that this is not so;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is like R. Chiya bar Aba. (Regarding Kisuy, Rebbi holds like R. Shimon, that invalid Shechitah is not considered Shechitah.)</p></div>
