<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE ISUR OF A DANGLING LIMB</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef citing Rav):</span> If one eats it, he is lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">A Talmid:</span> No. Rav holds that one who eats it is not lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> On whom should we rely?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Rav said both (in different cases)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the animal died (without Shechitah), the limb is Ever Min ha'Chai. One is lashed for eating it;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If the animal was slaughtered, the limb is forbidden only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is the source that death makes Nipul, but Shechitah does not make Nipul?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> "Anything that they (Sheratzim) will fall on b'Mosam, it will become Tamei" - what does this come to exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If need not exclude when they are alive. Nevelah already excludes this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it teaches that death makes Nipul, but Shechitah does not make Nipul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> That verse refers to Sheratzim, and not to animals!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Shechitah does not apply to Sheratzim. Therefore, we use the verse to teach about animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need this verse to teach that Sheratzim are Metamei only when they are moist!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "b'Mosam" twice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> R. Meir and Chachamim argue about the limb of a live fetus, but all agree that if a limb of a dead fetus left the womb, Shechitah of the mother is not Metaher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> They argue in both cases.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A NON-VIABLE FETUS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A living Ben Shmoneh (he was born in the eighth month of pregnancy, i.e. a Nefel)... (Shechitah does not apply to this category of animals).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Even though Shechitah applies to (all Tahor animals, which includes) a Ben Shmoneh, it becomes Nevelah even if it is slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> That Tana says that Shechitah applies to a Ben Shmoneh, because Shechitah of the mother permits a Ben Shmoneh inside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana of our Mishnah does not consider this grounds to say that Shechitah applies to a Ben Shmoneh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the Tana of the Beraisa know that a slaughtered Terefah is not a Nevelah? (It is not enough that Shechitah applies to Terefah animals, just like he holds that it is not enough that Shechitah applies to a Ben Shmoneh in its mother.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah, and also a Beraisa):</span> "When will die from an animal (... the Nevelah)" teaches that some animals become Nevelah when they die, and others do not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A slaughtered Terefah does not become Nevelah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>PERMITING A FETUS IN THE WOMB</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Hoshaya):</span> If one slaughtered a fetus inside the womb, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We can ask according to both R. Meir and Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir requires slaughtering a Ben Peku'ah (a fetus inside a slaughtered mother, for it is not permitted through Shechitah of its mother) only when it left the mother. He could hold that Shechitah does not apply to it before it leaves the womb;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim permit a Ben Peku'ah through Shechitah of the mother. They could hold that alternatively, it can be permitted through its own Shechitah in the womb!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chananya - Mishnah):</span> An animal that was Terefah from (when it left) the womb (never had a potential Heter)...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Shechitah of a fetus in the womb permits, it could have been permitted before it became Terefah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> The Mishnah should say 'an animal that was Terefah from when it was formed in the womb.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the animal has an extra hind leg, we would know that it was Terefah from its formation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughters an animal and finds inside a Ben Shmoneh (eight month fetus, i.e. a Nefel), dead or alive, or a dead Ben Tesha (a nine-month (viable) fetus), the fetus may be eaten without Shechitah, just its blood must be removed;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Meir says, if a live Ben Tesha is inside, it must be slaughtered. The Isur of slaughtering a mother and her child on the same day applies to the child;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Chachamim say, Shechitah of the mother is Metaher (permits) the child;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">74b----------------------------------------74b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Shimon Shezuri says, even if the child is five years old and plowing in the field, Shechitah of the mother was Metaher it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>If one tore open the mother and found a live Ben Tesha in it, the fetus must be slaughtered, for its mother was not slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Elazar):</span> Chachamim were lenient about a Ben Peku'ah only regarding Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He excludes its Chelev and Gid ha'Nasheh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Rejection:</span> They argue also about those, and Chachamim are lenient!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The Gid ha'Nasheh and Chelev of a fetus are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah permits them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> They argue about a live Ben Tesha, just like they argue about Shechitah (whether a Ben Peku'ah is considered a live animal or permitted meat).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Question:</span> Which Chelev does he exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He cannot exclude Chelev of the fetus. They argue about those, and Chachamim are lenient!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The Gid ha'Nasheh and Chelev of a fetus are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah permits them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> They argue about a live Ben Tesha, just like they argue about Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, R. Elazar meant that R. Meir is stringent only about Shechitah, but he permits the Chelev of the Gid ha'Nasheh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Meir forbids it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One must dig out all the all the fat around the Gid ha'Nasheh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it suffices to remove what is above the surface. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, R. Elazar meant that Chachamim are lenient only about matters relating to eating, but they forbid bestiality with the calf, or making it work with a different species.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>IS A BEN PEKU'AH CONSIDERED AN ANIMAL?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> R. Yehudah, who permits its Chelev, permits also its blood. R. Meir, who forbids its Chelev, forbids also its blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> All agree that the blood is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish - Mishnah):</span> One tears the fetus and extracts the blood. (No one argues. All forbid the blood!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Reish Lakish meant only that one is not Chayav Kares for eating the blood. He agrees that it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Reish Lakish said this according to R. Yehudah. R. Yehudah holds that one is Chayav Kares for eating Dam Tamtzis (blood that drains out after the initial spurt of blood when an animal dies). Blood of a fetus should not be more lenient!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one eats Dam Tamtzis he transgresses a Lav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he is Chayav Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef brei d'Rav Sala Chasida):</span> R. Yehudah learns from "blood... all blood" that there is Kares for Dam Tamtzis only if there is Kares for he animal's Dam ha'Nefesh (the blood that exudes when it dies).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can a Ben Peku'ah be used for a Seh (sheep or goat) to redeem a firstborn donkey?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to R. Meir, clearly it can. Since it must be slaughtered, it is a fully fledged Seh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to Chachamim, do we say that since it became permitted through its mother's Shechitah, it is called meat (and not a Seh);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Or, since it runs around, it is called a Seh?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mar Zutra):</span> It cannot be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> It can be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi to Mar Zutra):</span> Do you learn from a Gezeirah Shavah Seh-Seh from the Korban Pesach (for which a Ben Peku'ah is invalid)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If so, you should require all the qualifications for the Korban Pesach, i.e. an unblemished male in its first year!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah says twice "you will redeem." The repetition is Machshir even a Seh lacking qualifications for Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should allow also a Ben Peku'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This cannot be, for then the Gezeirah Shavah would not teach anything.</p></div>
