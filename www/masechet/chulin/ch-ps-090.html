<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE ISUR TAKES EFFECT ON KODSHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though the Isur of Kodshim comes first, the Isur of the Gid is Chal on it, because it is more stringent. It applies also to Bnei No'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah is the Tana who considers this to be a stringency. Our Mishnah is not like R. Yehudah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Our Mishnah forbids the right and left Gidin. R. Yehudah forbids only one!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana holds like R. Yehudah that Gid ha'Nasheh is a severe Isur, but he forbids both Gidim like Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yehudah said that Gid ha'Nasheh is severe and is Chal on the Isur of a Tamei animal, which is a regular Lav. We have no source that it is Chal on Kodshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kodshim are severe. They entail Kares (if a Tamei person ate Kodshim, or one who eats Pigul or Nosar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 3:f, 89b):</span> Our Mishnah teaches that Gid ha'Nasheh applies to a Bechor (firstborn male. It becomes Kodesh when it leaves the womb, and the Gid is already forbidden.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Our Tana holds that the offspring of Kodshim become Kodesh when they leave the womb.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>GID HA'NASHEH ON THE MIZBE'ACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Yosef):</span> The Mishnah says that Gid ha'Nasheh applies to Kodshim. This applies only to Kodshim that are eaten, but not to those that are not eaten (e.g. Olah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It applies to both kinds of Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> They do not argue. They discuss different matters;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> R. Yochanan obligates lashes for eating the Gid of either type of Kodshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Chiya bar Yosef teaches that the Gid is offered on the Mizbe'ach (i.e. we leave it in the thigh of an Olah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> R. Chiya bar Yosef teaches that the Gid need not be removed from an Olah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yochanan teaches that if the Gid was removed, it may not be offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> They argue about offering the Gid on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Hiktir ha'Kohen Es ha'Kol ha'Mizbechah" includes bones, Gidim, horns and hoofs;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they are offered even if they separated from the meat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Asisa Olosecha ha'Basar veha'Dam." (We offer only blood and meat.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we must remove the Gidim and bones!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hiktir ha'Kohen Es ha'Kol".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> He burns them if they are attached. If they became separated, even on top of the Mizbe'ach, they are brought down.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This is like Rebbi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Hiktir ha'Kohen Es ha'Kol ha'Mizbechah" includes bones, Gidim, horns and hooves, even if they separated.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "v'Asisa Olosecha ha'Basar veha'Dam"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches about things that fly off the Mizbe'ach when being burned:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If meat comes off, we return it. If bones and Gidim come off, we don't return them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rebbi):</span> One verse teaches that we burn everything, and another says only blood and meat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution (Rebbi):</span> We burn everything that is attached. What separated, even on the Mizbe'ach, is brought down.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The verse need not teach that they are offered when attached. We learn from the head. It has many bones, and it is offered whole!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rather, the verse teaches that even if they separated, they are offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> We learn from the head only that things permitted (to Yisraelim) are offered when attached;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The verse teaches that the Gid ha'Nasheh is offered when attached.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">90b----------------------------------------90b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> "Mi'Mashke Yisrael" - only things permitted to Yisrael are offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Blood and Chelev are offered, even though they are forbidden to Yisrael!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> They are the primary things offered. We cannot learn to other forbidden parts of the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The thigh of an Olah is taken up the ramp whole. On top, the Gid ha'Nasheh is removed and thrown onto the ash-heap.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Bnei Yisrael are forbidden to eat the Gid ha'Nasheh. The Mizbe'ach may consume it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Huna learns from "mi'Mashke Yisrael".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The Gid ha'Nasheh of a Shelamim is swept into the Amah (a channel that flows through the Azarah). An Olah's Gid is brought up.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is brought up and burned on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is brought up (the ramp) and removed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why do we bring it up?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not nice to bring up a thigh from which the Gid has been removed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> The Gid ha'Nasheh of a Shelamim is swept into the Amah. An Olah's Gid is removed and thrown onto the ash-heap.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>EXAGGERATION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The ash-heap was in the middle of the Mizbe'ach. Sometimes, there would be 300 Kor (about 10,000 liters) of ashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is an exaggeration.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They would give the Korban Tamid to drink from a gold cup before slaughtering it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is an exaggeration.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> The Torah, prophets, and Chachamim all exaggerate:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim exaggerate in the above examples;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Torah exaggerates - "great cities, fortified up to Heaven".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Nevi'im exaggerate - "the land cleaved from their voices".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Nachmani):</span> Chachamim exaggerated in three places - the ash-heap (above), the golden vine, and the Paroches (curtain in the Mikdash.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There was a golden vine on the entrance to the Heichal, supported by poles. If someone donated a grape or cluster (of gold), they would hang it on the vine;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok says, 300 Kohanim were needed to move it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> The Paroches was one Tefach thick. It was made with 72 Nirim (a Nir is a thread with a ring through which warp threads pass). Each strand was made of 24 threads;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It was 40 Amos long and 20 Amos wide. It was made from 82,000 threads (some say 82,000 weavers);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Every year, two were made. 300 Kohanim were needed to immerse it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE LEFT AND RIGHT GIDIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Gidin of both thighs are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Our Mishnah is not like R. Yehudah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Only one of them is forbidden. Da'as (understanding) dictates that it is the right Gid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Yehudah reach a sure verdict?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The 'Da'as' he refers to is the Torah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps he was unsure, and he said that Da'as leans to say that it is the right Gid?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> Bones, Gidim and Nosar (what was left over until morning) of the Korban Pesach are burned on the 16th of Nisan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of Gidim?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If they are edible Gidim, they should be eaten, not burned!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>They cannot be Nosar, for Nosar is listed separately!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They are Gidim of the neck (which are generally too hard to eat).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If they are not considered meat (rather, bone), they can be discarded. Why must they be burned?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> The Beraisa discusses the Gid ha'Nasheh, according to R. Yehudah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he was unsure which is forbidden, we understand this. Because of the doubt, neither Gid is eaten. Both must be burned.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Culmination of answer (d)):</span> If he was sure that the right Gid is forbidden, it can be discarded, and the left Gid should be eaten!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1: (Rav Ika bar Chanina):</span> Really, he is sure. The case is, the two Gidim got mixed up, so they must be burned.</p></div>
