<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A FETUS THAT PARTIALLY LEFT THE WOMB</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> The rule is, something that is part of the animal is forbidden. If it is not part of the animal, it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The latter clause permits this case. ('Not part of the animal' refers to a fetus whose limbs were cut one by one.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it permits a fetus whose hooves are not split, according to R. Shimon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He forbids a calf whose hooves are not split if it was born. It is permitted if it was found in a slaughtered cow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chananyah):</span> If a fetus inside a Shelamim stuck out a leg (at the time of Shechitah) in the Mikdash, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since the Mikdash is the proper place to slaughter Korbanos, the leg is considered to be in its proper place;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, the proper place for the fetus is in the womb. The Mikdash is no substitute.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question (Abaye):</span> Why didn't you ask (according to Rav, who holds that returning a limb before Shechitah does not help) about a Shelamim that stuck out a leg in Yerushalayim (and returned it, and it was slaughtered in the Mikdash. Is this as if it never left its proper place,) for Yerushalayim is its proper place to be eaten?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> You did not ask, because you hold that it must remain in the womb;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> This answers also your question!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ilfa):</span> If a fetus stuck out a leg between the cutting of the two Simanim, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Had the leg been out or in for the entire Shechitah, it would not become a Nevelah.) Do we join the cutting of the two Simanim, to be Metaher the limb from Tum'as Nevelah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We join the two Simanim to permit eating the rest of the animal (even though the first Siman had potential to permit more than the second). All the more so, we join them to be Metaher the leg.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Are we concerned for offspring of a fetus that stuck out a leg before Shechitah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The calf impregnated a normal cow.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, R. Yirmeyah should have asked about (offspring of) a normal Ben Peku'ah (fetus found inside a slaughtered cow) that did not stick out a leg!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Mesharshiya):</span> According to the opinion that an animal's status depends (also) on its father, the child of a Ben Peku'ah that mated with a regular cow is forbidden, even if one slaughters it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, this fetus mated with a cow that likewise stuck out a leg before its mother was slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Do we say that limbs of the child come from the corresponding limbs of the parents, and only the leg of the child is forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, do all parts of the child come from all parts of the parents, and the entire child is forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Clearly, all parts of the child come from all parts of the parents. If not, parents who were blind or missing a limb would have children with the same blemishes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Rather, there is a different reason to ask whether the children are permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All animals have Chelev and blood, which are forbidden, yet the offspring are permitted. Here also, even though the parents have a forbidden leg, the children are permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps the children are permitted when there are two forbidden entities in the parents, but not when there are three?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to whom does R. Yirmeyah ask?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is not according to R. Meir. He holds that a Ben Peku'ah must be slaughtered (so the leg of the parents is not forbidden)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It is not according to R. Yehudah. He permits Chelev of a fetus (Ben Peku'ah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The Gid ha'Nasheh (sciatic nerve) and Chelev of a fetus are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>R. Yehudah permits them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Clearly, the children are permitted even though parts of the parents are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If a fetus stuck out a leg before its mother was slaughtered, is milk of the child permitted?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All milk is like Ever Min ha'Chai (part of a living animal), yet the Torah permitted it. Also this is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, here is different, because part of the child (its leg) can never become permitted?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT IS PERMITTED INSIDE A SLAUGHTERED ANIMAL?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one cuts the fetus... (it is permitted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "And every animal with split hooves... . in an animal" includes a fetus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, Temurah should apply to a fetus! (It says "in an animal" also regarding Temurah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> Temurah does not take effect in the following cases:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One said that a limb should be in place of a fetus, or vice-versa;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>One said that a limb or fetus should be in place of a full animal, or vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, "and every animal" includes a fetus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even if a piece of the spleen or kidneys is cut (before Shechitah), it should be permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Our Mishnah):</span> If one cut a piece from a fetus (and left it) inside, it may be eaten (after Shechitah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one cut from the spleen or kidneys, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "It (you will eat)" - when the animal is complete, what is inside is permitted, but not when part was cut off (what was cut is not permitted).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, if one slaughters an animal and finds something resembling a dove inside, it should be permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one slaughters an animal and finds something resembling a dove inside, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">69b----------------------------------------69b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah permits "Perasos (two (i.e. split) hooves... in an animal)". A dove lacks this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should forbid a fetus with uncloven hooves found in a slaughtered animal! (We said that even R. Shimon permits it - 68b, 1:s:ii.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Parsah... in an animal you may eat." (It says Parsah, and also Perasos, to permit whether or not the hooves are split.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like R. Shimon. (Since he forbids a calf born with uncloven hooves, he needs a verse to permit a fetus with uncloven hooves.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Defense (of Answer #1 - Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> R. Shimon is the Tana who holds that Temurah does not apply to fetuses, because the Torah equates Temurah to Ma'aser;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like Ma'aser does not apply to limbs and fetuses, also Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that R. Shimon is the Tana?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Seifa of Mishnah #1 - R. Yosi):</span> Regarding Hekdesh, if one said 'the leg of this animal is an Olah', the entire animal becomes an Olah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Similarly regarding Temurah, if one said 'the leg of this animal is (a Korban) in place of this', the entire animal should become a Temurah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whom does R. Yosi address?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He addresses R. Meir and R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They argue with R. Yosi's first premise!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir and R. Yehudah) Suggestion:</span> If one says 'the leg of this animal is an Olah', perhaps the entire animal is an Olah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "All that you will give from it to Hash-m will be Kodesh" - part of it will be Kodesh, but not all of it;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one can redeem the Kodesh part!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "It will be" - it remains Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p>Rather, we sell it to someone who needs an Olah. The money (that he was Makdish to buy an Olah) becomes Chulin, except for the value of the leg (which was already Kodesh).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><p>R. Yosi and R. Shimon say, if one says 'the leg of this animal is an Olah', the entire animal is an Olah. We learn from "it will be."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Yosi (in the Mishnah) must address R. Shimon, for only he agrees that making the leg Hekdesh is Mekadesh the entire animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is no proof. R. Yosi merely explains how he learns. (Perhaps the other Tana'im reject his premise.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN A BECHOR BECOMES MEKUDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The first time an animal gives birth, one may cut off limbs of the child one by one (when each leaves) and cast them to dogs;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the majority of the fetus comes out (together, and dies), it must be buried. The next child of the mother is not a Bechor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> If a third of a Bechor left the womb, and the owner sold it to a Nochri, and another third came out, it has Kedushas Bechor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that the Kedushah comes retroactively, when the majority comes out. This shows that even the first part was a Bechor, so the sale was invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> The child has no Kedushah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that the Kedushah (normally) comes from now and onwards, so the sale was valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rav Huna and Rabah are consistent with their opinions elsewhere;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If a Bechor was born one third through Caesarian section, and the rest came out from the womb, it has no Kedushah. (Tzlach - after a third came out, they tore until the womb.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since the Kedushah comes (only) retroactively, and the beginning of the birth cannot be Mekadesh it, it remains Chulin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> The child is a Bechor;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Kedushah starts with birth (of the majority through the womb).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>We needed to hear the argument in both cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had we heard only the latter case, we would think that Rav Huna is always lenient, and says that even in the first case that the child is Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had we only heard the first case, we would think that Rabah is always stringent, and says even in the latter case that the child is Kodesh.</p></div>
