<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHICH WATER MAY BE USED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> It once happened that a man was fed pork because he did not wash before a meal. (The one serving him assumed that he was a Nochri);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Another man (Reuven) did not wash after a meal, and this caused him to divorce his wife. It enabled someone to see what Reuven had eaten, and thereby trick Reuven's wife.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> The man who did not wash beforehand was fed Nevelah. Reuven killed his wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> One may not wash before a meal using water heated by a fire.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One may wash with it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Gamliel the son of Rebbi (who ate his food in Taharah) said that all the great Chachamim of Galil do so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> One may not wash before a meal with water of (the hot spring of) Teverya, but he may immerse his hands in the water (to be Metaher them);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One may immerse his whole body in the water (to become Tahor), but not his hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one may immerse his whole body in the water, all the more so he may immerse his hands in it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> All agree that one may immerse his hands in the spring itself;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All agree that one may not wash with water taken from the spring in a Kli;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They argue about Bas Birsa (a channel into which the spring flowed. It does not contain 40 Se'ah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Mid'Oraisa, it is valid for immersion (it is connected to the spring. Alternatively, 40 Se'ah are needed only to immerse a person. A Revi'is suffices for everything else). R. Yochanan decrees to disqualify it mid'Rabanan, lest one immerse in a Kli. Chizkiyah does not decree.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Chizkiyah and R. Yochanan argue like the following Tana'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If water spoiled to the point that animals cannot drink it:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the water is in a Kli, it is Pasul (for washing). If it is in the ground, it is Kosher (for immersion);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, even if it is in the ground, it may be used (only) to immerse one's body, but not one's (face,) hands and feet. (Rashi - there is no Halachic significance of immersing the face or feet; the Tana mentioned them merely because it is typical to discuss washing the face, hands and feet. Rabbeinu Gershom deletes 'face' from the text. The Beraisa discusses Kidush of the hands and feet for Avodah in the Mikdash.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one may immerse his whole body in the water, all the more so he may immerse his hands (and feet) in it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about Bas Birsa. R. Shimon decrees to disqualify it, lest one immerse in a Kli. The first Tana does not decree.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>FOR WHICH FOOD DO WE WASH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> We wash before a meal of Chulin so that we will be accustomed to guarding our hands from Tum'ah, lest we be Metamei Terumah. Also, it is a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Mitzvah is it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It is the Mitzvah to obey Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It is the Mitzvah (Rashi - mid'Oraisa; Tosfos - mid'Rabanan) to obey R. Elazar ben Arach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar ben Arach):</span> "Anyone whom a Zav will touch, and will not wash his hands" is Chachamim's source for washing before a meal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> How does he learn this from the verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> We cannot take the verse literally. If a Zav touched someone, washing his hands is not Metaher. He must immerse!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rather, it is a Scriptual support for the Rabbinic law that someone else (not touched by a Zav, rather, one about to eat) is Tamei until he washes his hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> We wash for fruit only for cleanliness.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>People understood that it is not an obligation, but it is a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is not even a Mitzvah. It is Reshus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This is unlike Rav Nachman;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> One who washes his hands for fruit is haughty.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah bar bar Chanah:</span> I was in front of R. Ami and R. Asi. A basket of fruit was brought to them. They ate without washing the hands. They did not give to me, and each blessed by himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>We learn three things from this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We do not wash the hands for fruit;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When people eat fruit together, they do not make a Zimun (a preface to saying the Berachah Acharonah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If two people ate, the Mitzvah is for each to bless (afterwards) by himself (and not for one to exempt the others).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If two people ate, the Mitzvah is for each to bless by himself;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is only if both know how to bless. If only one of them knows, he blesses, and the other fulfills his obligation through listening.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HOW MUCH OF THE HAND MUST ONE WASH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> For Chulin, one must wash until the joint (the second knuckle from the end of the fingers);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">106b----------------------------------------106b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>For Terumah, one must wash until the joint (where the fingers connect to the palm);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Washing the hands in the Mikdash (before Avodah) must be until the (wrist) joint.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Any Chatzitzah (separation) that disqualifies immersion also disqualifies washing the hands for Chulin or washing the hands and feet in the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rav showed his Talmidim how far to wash for Chulin and how far for Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Shmuel was stringent. He required the same amount for Chulin as for Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rav Sheshes was lenient. He required the same amount for Terumah as for Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Ami was stringent. He required the same amount for Chulin as for Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do not say that he was stringent only because he was a Kohen. R. Meisha was just as stringent, and he was a Levi!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may wash his hands in the morning and stipulate that he will guard their Taharah the entire day (so he may eat without washing again).</p></div>
