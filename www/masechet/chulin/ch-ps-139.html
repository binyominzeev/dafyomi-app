<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE CASE OF KODSHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of Kodshim, for which a verse is needed to exempt?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one was Makdish a bird in his house, he is exempt. "Ki Yikarei" excludes Mezuman!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He saw a Hefker nest and was Makdish it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ish Ki Yakdish Beiso Kodesh" - one can be Makdish only things like his house, that he owns.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he lifted the chicks, was Makdish them, then put them back.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even if they were Chulin, he would not have to send the mother!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one took the chicks and returned them to the nest, and the mother returned, he need not send it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, he lifted the mother and was Makdish it, then put it back.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He was obligated to send it before he was Makdish it (and this obligation remains)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yochanan ben Yosef):</span> If one was Makdish a Chayah and then slaughtered it, he is exempt from Kisuy ha'Dam;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he slaughtered it and then was Makdish it, he must cover the blood, because he was already obligated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav):</span> He was Makdish the chicks in his dovecote to be Olos, and then they fled (and he recognizes one that matured and now sits on its young).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Shmuel):</span> One was Makdish his chicken (for Bedek ha'Bayis, and it fled, and now rests on its young).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel did not give Rav's answer. Shmuel teaches that the Mishnah applies even to Hekdesh Bedek ha'Bayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav give Shmuel's answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav exempts from sending only when he made it Hekdesh Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since they have Kedushas ha'Guf (to be offered), the Kedushah does not vanish when they flee;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding Hekdesh Bedek ha'Bayis, only the value is Kodesh. The Kedushah vanishes when they flee, and he must send the mother.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Shmuel holds that even Kedushas Bedek ha'Bayis does not vanish, for wherever they flee, they are in Hash-m's domain - "la'Shem ha'Aretz u'Melo'ah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Also R. Yochanan explained the Mishnah like Shmuel. Reish Lakish argued like Rav, and R. Yochanan answered like Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ACHARAYUS FOR HEKDESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradictions:</span> R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish contradict what they said elsewhere!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a man said "this money is for Bedek ha'Bayis" and it was stolen or lost, he has Acharayus (he must replace the loss to Hekdesh) until he gives it to the Gizbar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He has no Acharayus. From the moment he designated the money, wherever it is, it is in Hash-m's domain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1 (for Reish Lakish):</span> The latter teaching of Reish Lakish was after he heard and accepted R. Yochanan's answer regarding our Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 2 (for R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yochanan says that he has Acharayus when he said "Alai (it is incumbent upon me)." He has no Acharayus when he did not say this. He only designated the money.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we must say that Reish Lakish exempts from Acharayus even when he says "Alai"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said "it is Alai to bring an Olah", this is a Neder. If he said "this is an Olah," this is a Nedavah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The difference between them is, if it dies or is stolen or lost, one has Acharayus for a Neder, not for a Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish holds that this applies only to Kodshei Mizbe'ach, since they must be offered. One need not do anything to Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis (other than give them to Hekdesh), so he has no Acharayus even if he said "Alai."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one said "this ox is an Olah," or "this house is a Korban," and the ox died or the house fell, he has no Acharayus;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he said "this ox is Alai an Olah," or "this house is Alai a Korban," and the ox died or the house fell, he has Acharayus (even though the only Kedushah of a house is its value)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He has Acharayus only when it fell, but not if it stands, for wherever it is, it is in Hash-m's domain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> All agree regarding Erchin (a pledge to give to Hekdesh an amount based on one's age and gender) that even if he said Alai, he has no Acharayus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Alai" is not extra (to show that he accepts Acharayus). It is the only way to obligate oneself in Erchin!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"My Erech" or "Ploni's Erech" is meaningless, for he did not say who must give it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rava):</span> He could say "Hareni b'Erki (or b'Erech Ploni", I am obligated to give my Erech or Ploni's Erech)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Objection #2 (Rava - Beraisa - R. Noson) Question: The verse "v'Nasan Es ha'Erkecha... Kodesh la'Shem" discusses redeeming a field. Why does it say "ha'Erkecha"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One has no Acharayus on money given to redeem Hekdesh or Ma'aser Sheni. One might have thought that similarly, there is no Acharayus on money designated to pay Erchin. The verse teaches this is not so. The money is Chulin until it is given to the Gizbar.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">139b----------------------------------------139b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Rav Hamnuna taught that all agree about Erchin, that even if he did not say Alai, he has Acharayus;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Nasan Es ha'Erkecha" teaches that it is Chulin until it is given to the Gizbar.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN DOES THE MITZVAH APPLY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kisuy ha'Dam is more stringent...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Ki Yikarei (when will happen)... "?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that "Shale'ach Teshalach" teaches that one must go to mountains to seek to fulfill the Mitzvah. "Ki Yikarei" teaches that this is not so. One must do the Mitzvah only if it presents itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Kan" teaches that the Mitzvah applies no matter how small the nest is (even one chick or egg);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Tzipor" is a Tahor (mother) bird, but not a Tamei bird;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Lefanecha" refers to a Reshus ha'Yachid. "Ba'Derech" refers to a Reshus ha'Rabim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source if it is in a tree?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "b'Chol Etz."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source if it is in a pit or cave?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Oh Al ha'Aretz."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we include all places, why must the Torah teach "Lefanacha ba'Derech"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This teaches that the Mitzvah applies only to cases similar to "ba'Derech," i.e. it is not Mezuman.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is the source to obligate (sending) doves that nested in a dovecote or attic, birds that nested in a hole in a wall or in a tower, and chickens and geese that nested in an orchard, but not birds that nested in a house or domestic doves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> We said that "ba'Derech" teaches that the Mitzvah applies only when it is not Mezuman. "Ki Yikarei" teaches this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> What does "Lefanacha" teach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, "Lefanacha" includes birds that were owned and fled;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Ba'Derech" teaches Rav Yehudah's law.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one finds a nest on the sea, he must send the mother - "ba'Yam Darech."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the same should apply to a nest (held by its mother) in the air - "Derech ha'Nesher ba'Shamayim"!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. The air is called "Derech Nesher." It is not called (plain) "Derech."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan of Papunai):</span> Does the Mitzvah apply to a nest on a man's head?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Masnah):</span> It says "va'Adamah Al Rosho" (it is considered like on the ground).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CERTAIN NAMES AND WORDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where does the Torah allude to Moshe (before his birth), (the fate of) Haman, (the story of) Esther and (the aggrandizing of) Mordechai?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Beshagam... his years will be 120" alludes to Moshe (he lived to be 120, and the Gematri'a of Beshagam is 345, like that of Moshe);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Ha'MiN ha'Etz" alludes to the hanging of Haman. "Haster ASTiR Panai" refers to the story of Esther (Hash-m acted in a hidden way). "(Besamim Rosh (i.e. the head of the Tzadikim)) Mar Deror" alludes to Mordechai. The translation of this is "MaRa DaCHYa."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> What is not considered Mezuman?...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Chiya or R. Shimon (son of Rebbi) taught that the Mishnah discusses "Hadrasios" doves. The other says the text reads "Hordasios."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The latter opinion says that they are called by Hordus' name, because he started to raise them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The former opinion says that they are called by the name of the place of their origin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> I saw 16 rows of such birds, each row a Mil (kilometer) long; they were saying "Kiri (master) Kiri," except for one, which was saying "Kiri Biri (i.e. Hordus was really a slave)."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> These are (fictitious) words.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Kahana said that he saw it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Rav Ashi meant that they spoke in the language of birds (Aruch; Rashi - they spoke through witchcraft).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> We learn from "Kan Tzipor." "Ohf" refers to Tahor and Tamei birds, but "Tzipor" refers only to Tahor birds.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, "Tzipor" refers to Tahor birds. "Kanaf" refers to Tamei birds and Chagavim. (The next three questions are based on the above suggestion. The same answer is given.)</p></div>
