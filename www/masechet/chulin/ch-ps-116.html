<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>QUESTIONS ON THE KAL VA'CHOMER (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Mordechai, citing Reish Lakish):</span> Rather, when we learn from one source (e.g. Kal va'Chomer), we challenge only from a leniency or stringency;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When we learn from two sources, we may challenge from anything common to the sources (which is not found in the Lamed);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When we learn from three sources, if we (can challenge the third source from a leniency or stringency, and) must learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah, we may challenge from anything common to the sources;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If we need not learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah, we challenge only from a leniency or stringency.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Qestion:</span> We should challenge that Kilayim was never permitted, but Basar v'Chalav were permitted before they were cooked together!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> Since we do not ask this, it must be that regarding Kil'ai ha'Kerem, what was planted (the tree, vine or seeds, which were initially permitted) becomes forbidden, so this is just like Basar v'Chalav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shemaya bar Ze'ira - Mishnah):</span> If one passes a holed flowerpot through a vineyard:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If what is growing in the pot grew another one part in 200 (while passing through), it is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it did not grow more, it is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye) Contradiction:</span> One verse says "Pen Tikdash ha'Mele'ah" (only additional growth becomes forbidden). Another verse forbids "ha'Zera";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> If it was Kil'ayim when planted, it is forbidden once it takes root;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was planted b'Heter, and later grew in a situation of Kil'ayim, it is forbidden only if it grew another one part in 200.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT DIFFERENT TANA'IM FORBID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Our Mishnah is not like the following Tana;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Yehudah):</span> One may not eat Basar v'Chalav, but it is Mutar b'Hana'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One verse forbidding Basar v'Chalav says "you are a Kodesh nation to Hash-m." Another verse says "you will be Kodesh people to me (do not eat Terefah meat)";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like Terefah may not be eaten but it is Mutar b'Hana'ah, also Basar v'Chalav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> The Isur does not apply to Chayos and birds (and Tamei animals. These are excluded by the three times it says "Gedi" in the verses of Basar v'Chalav.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need these to learn what Shmuel (113b) expounded from them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva does not need verses to teach (three of) Shmuel's laws;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that in general, Isur Chal Al Isur (so Basar v'Chalav applies to Chelev and Nevelah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He holds that a fetus is a fully-fledged kid (so Basar v'Chalav applies to it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Therefore, he expounds all three "Gedi"s like above.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> It says "do not eat a Nevelah... "</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do R. Akiva and R. Yosi ha'Glili argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Yosi ha'Glili holds that mid'Oraisa, Basar v'Chalav applies to Chayos. R. Akiva holds that this is only mid'Rabanan;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They argue about fowl;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva holds that mid'Oraisa, Basar v'Chalav does not apply to fowl. This implies that mid'Rabanan it applies;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Glili holds that it does not apply to fowl even mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> In R. Eliezer's region, (when a Bris Milah occurred on Shabbos they would arrange that there was no knife available. This required that) they would cut trees to make coals to make a knife (R. Eliezer permits all preparations for Milah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In R. Yosi ha'Glili's region, they would eat fowl cooked with milk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Levi visited the house of Yosef the bird-trapper. They served peacock with milk. He did not comment.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Why didn't you excommunicate them?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Levi:</span> That is the region of R. Yehudah ben Beseira. Presumably, he taught them like R. Yosi ha'Glili, who permits this.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MILK IN THE STOMACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The stomach of a Nochri's animal or of a Nevelah is forbidden. (In this Sugya, 'stomach' refers to milk in the stomach unless specified otherwise.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one used the skin of the stomach to curdle milk, it is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">116b----------------------------------------116b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If the milk absorbed the Ta'am of meat, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If a Kosher animal nursed from a Terefah, the stomach is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If a Terefah nursed from a Kosher animal, the stomach is permitted, because the milk is just gathered there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah list separately a Nochri's animal and Nevelah? Whatever he slaughters is Nevelah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> The Mishnah forbids the milk even if a Yisrael bought a kid from a Nochri and slaughtered it himself. We are concerned lest it nursed from a Terefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are we really concerned for that?!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may buy eggs from Nochrim. We are not concerned lest they are from a Nevelah or Terefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, we are concerned that it nursed from a Tamei animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are we more concerned for nursing from a Tamei animal than from a Terefah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tamei animals are more common than Terefos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should be concerned even regarding animals of a Yisrael!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If a Yisrael sees his animal nursing from a Tamei animal, he will separate it. Therefore, Chachamim did not decree;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If a Nochri sees this, he will leave it, so Chachamim decreed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah states one case, i.e. the stomach of an animal slaughtered by a Nochri, which is a Nevelah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Shmuel taught that cheese of Nochrim is forbidden because they use the skin of the stomach of Nevelah to curdle it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The (milk in the) stomach is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Originally, the Mishnah forbade (milk in) the stomach (of a Nochri's animal, and Shmuel explained that this is because it is a Nevelah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel explained why cheese of Nochrim is forbidden according to the conclusion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kosher animal nursed from a Terefah, the stomach is forbidden. If a Terefah nursed from a Kosher animal, the stomach is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha forbids the stomach of a Nochri's animal or of a Nevelah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> Eating something (milk) found in a Nevelah looks like eating a Nevelah, so Chachamim forbade it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Terefah was slaughtered, so it does not look like eating a Nevelah, so Chachamim permit it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> We should say just the contrary!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Nevelah is repulsive. Even if the milk inside was permitted, no one would come to eat the Nevelah. Even so, the milk is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Terefah is not repulsive. If the milk was permitted, people might come to eat the Terefah. All the more so, Chachamim should forbid it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yitzchak):</span> The Reisha was the original version. Milk inside a Nevelah (or Terefah) is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Seifa is the revised version. Milk inside a Terefah (or Nevelah) is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since people were used to the original version, it was left in the Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHAT MAY BE USED TO MAKE CHEESE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> We may curdle (milk) using the (milk in the) stomach of a Nevelah, but not of an animal slaughtered by a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimon bar Aba):</span> Is this like R. Eliezer, who presumes that all acts of a Nochri are for idolatry?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Of course it is!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak citing R. Yochanan):</span> We may curdle using the (milk in the) stomach of a Nevelah, or an animal slaughtered by a Nochri. We are not concerned for R. Eliezer's opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Tosfos):</span> The Halachah is, we not may curdle in the skin of the stomach of a Nevelah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>We may use (congealed milk in) the stomach of the following;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Nevelah or an animal slaughtered by a Nochri;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Kosher animal that nursed from a Terefah, and all the more so a Terefah that nursed from a Kosher animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is because congealed milk in the stomach is considered like Pirsha (a secretion, or waste. It is no longer forbidden.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> The Halachah is, we may not curdle in the skin of the stomach of a Nevelah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We may use the (milk in the) stomach of a Nevelah or an animal slaughtered by a Nochri (if it nursed from a Kosher animal, because the milk inside is merely gathered, it is not like part of the kid).</p></div>
