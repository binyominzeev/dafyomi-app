<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHO MAY SLAUGHTER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All (may) slaughter, and the Shechitah is Kosher, except for a Cheresh (deaf-mute), lunatic or minor, lest he slaughter improperly;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If any of them that slaughtered while others looked on, the Shechitah is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> 'All (may) slaughter' connotes, l'Chatchilah. 'And the Shechitah is Kosher' connotes b'Di'eved!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> 'All' does not always connote l'Chatchilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All make Temurah (declare a Chulin animal to be in place of a Korban), both men and women.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This is not l'Chatchilah - "he will not switch it"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> There, the Mishnah clarifies itself, 'not that one may make Temurah, but that if one did, the Chulin animal becomes Hekdesh, and the person gets 40 lashes'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rav Acha brei d'Rava - Mishnah):</span> All (may) pledge one's Erech (a value based on his age and gender) to Hekdesh, and others (may) pledge them. All pledge one's value (as a slave) to Hekdesh, and others pledge them.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is not l'Chatchilah - "if you will refrain from vowing, you will not bear sin"!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "It is better that you should not vow, than to vow and not fulfill" - better than either (vowing and not fulfilling, or vowing and fulfilling) is not to vow at all;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, the best is to vow and fulfill.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>Even R. Yehudah allows only declaring an animal Hekdesh, but not to obligate oneself (to bring an animal, or to pledge to Hekdesh, due to concern lest he be unable to fulfill)!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> Can you say that whenever the Mishnah says 'all', it is b'Di'eved?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> 'All are obligated in the Mitzvah of Sukah.'</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> 'All are obligated in the Mitzvah of Tzitzis.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha):</span> I agree that when it says 'all are obligated', it is l'Chatchilah. However, otherwise, 'all' connotes b'Di'eved.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question #2 (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> All do Semichah (lean on the neck of their Korban), both men and women.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is l'Chatchilah - "he will lean his hand, and the Korban will be acceptable"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and clarification of Question #2 - Rav Acha):</span> I agree that 'all' applies to l'Chatchilah, but it applies also to b'Di'eved.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>I asked why we assume that in our Mishnah, it means l'Chatchilah, in order to ask a question. Perhaps it means b'Di'eved, and there is no difficulty!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to Question #2 - Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah continues 'and the Shechitah is Kosher', i.e. b'Di'eved. If 'all slaughter' also means b'Di'eved, why does the Mishnah use a second expression of b'Di'eved?</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A TAMEI WHO SLAUGHTERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to Question (c) - Rabah bar Ula):</span> The Mishnah teaches 'all may slaughter.' Even a Tamei person may slaughter Chulin...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He may slaughter Chulin Al Taharas Kodesh (treated as Kodshim). Rabah bar Ula holds that Chulin Al Taharas Kodesh is like Kodshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He uses a long knife, to avoid touching the animal (after the Shechitah, for then it can become Tamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Answer #1):</span> A Tamei person should not slaughter Kodshim, lest he touch the animal. If he slaughtered, and he is sure that he did not touch, the Shechitah is Kosher';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah says 'except for a Cheresh, lunatic or minor.' If they slaughtered even a Chulin animal, it is forbidden, lest they pause during the Shechitah, press (the knife, instead of cutting), or do Chaladah (Shechitah when the knife is covered).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says 'any of them who slaughtered while others looked on, the Shechitah is Kosher.' To whom does this refer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to a Cheresh, lunatic or minor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (They were just mentioned.) If so, the Mishnah should have said 'if they', and not 'any of them'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it refers to a Tamei (person) who slaughtered a Chulin animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Reisha permits that l'Chatchilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it refers to a Tamei who slaughtered Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must others look on? We said that it suffices that he is sure that he did not touch!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he is not here to ask him whether he touched.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A different Mishnah teaches that if a Tamei slaughtered Kodshim, it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Pasul (anyone disqualified from Avodah) slaughtered a Korban, it is Kosher, since Shechitah may be done by a Zar (non-Kohen), woman, slave, or Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This applies even to Kodshei Kodoshim, on condition that (if he is Tamei) he did not touch the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Primarily, our Mishnah teaches this law. That Mishnah teaches all Pesulim for Avodah, so it repeated the law of a Tamei who slaughtered a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Primarily, that Mishnah teaches this law. Since our Mishnah teaches about a Tamei who slaughters Chulin, it teaches also about when he slaughters Kodshim.</p></div>
