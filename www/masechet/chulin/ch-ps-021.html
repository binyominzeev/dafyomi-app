<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CUTTING THE NECKBONE BEFORE THE SIMANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In any case, how do we answer Rava's question?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> In Melikah, one breaks the neckbone without cutting most of the flesh (so the bird is not a Neveilah before cutting the Simanim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Ami cited Ze'iri's teaching. R. Zeira asked Rava's question. R. Ami pondered, then gave Rava's answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> In Melikah of a Chatas, one cuts the spine and neckbone without cutting most of the flesh. When he reaches the Kaneh or Veshet, he cuts one Siman or its majority, and most of the flesh with it;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>In an Olah, he cuts both Simanim or the majority of both.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is this Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is not like Chachamim. They require cutting the entire Siman(im);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It is not like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon. He says not to cut the entire Siman(im), only the majority!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa teaches that according to Chachamim, he cuts the entire Siman(im), and according to R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon, he cuts the majority.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon. It says that he cuts a (substantial) majority of the Siman(im), which is like cutting the entire Siman(im).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT MAKES A NEVEILAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If the neckbone (of a person) and the majority of surrounding flesh were cut, he is Metamei b'Ohel (anything above, below, or under the same roof as him becomes Tamei, for he is dead).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Eli died when his neckbone broke, even though the flesh was not cut!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An old person is different. "His neckbone broke and he died, for he was very old".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> If a person was torn lengthwise like a fish, he is Metamei b'Ohel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Yitzchak):</span> This is only if he was cut from the back.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If an animal was cut into two pieces, it is a Neveilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If the thigh and its cavity were removed, the animal is a Neveilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case that the cavity was removed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> When it crouches, one can see that something is missing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the head was chopped off, even if it is still quivering, it is a Neveilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like a lizard's tail, which keeps quivering even after it was cut off.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of 'the head was chopped off'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> Literally, it was totally severed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #2 (Rav Asi):</span> The Simanim were cut like we do to Olas ha'Of.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah (to Rav Asi):</span> Do you mean like Chachamim (the Simanim are totally severed), and you agree with Reish Lakish? Or, do you mean like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon (the majority of the each Siman is severed), and you argue with Reish Lakish?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Asi:</span> I mean like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #2 (Rav Asi):</span> The (majority of the) Simanim were cut like we do to Olas ha'Of according to R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HOW OLAS HA'OF IS OFFERED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "The second (bird) will be offered for an Olah, like the law", i.e. like the law of Chatas Behemah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is like Chatas ha'Of! (The verse teaches that he need not divide the head from the body.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will offer it" distinguishes between Chatas ha'Of and Olas ha'Of.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rather, Olas ha'Of is equated to Chatas Behemah to teach that it cannot come from money of Ma'aser Sheni, and it must be offered during the day and with the right hand.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps just like it suffices to cut the majority of both Simanim of Chatas Behemah, also of Olas ha'Of!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "U'Malak... v'Hiktir (he will do Melikah and he will burn)" teaches that just like the head and body of Olas ha'Of are burned separately on the Mizbe'ach, also Melikah separates the head from the body (i.e. the Simanim are cut entirely).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yishmael says, "like the law" refers to the law of Chatas ha'Of;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like Melikah of a Chatas is done on the back of the neck, also Melikah of an Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps just like one leaves the head and body of Chatas ha'Of connected, the same applies to Olas ha'Of!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "He will offer it." (Olas ha'Of is not offered like Chatas ha'Of.)</p></div>
