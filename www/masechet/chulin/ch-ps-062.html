<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HOW TO KNOW THAT A BIRD IS TAHOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If one who recognizes the Tamei species finds a bird that has a Siman (and knows that it is not from the Tamei species), it is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he does not recognize the Tamei species, if the bird has one Siman, (perhaps) it is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it has two Simanim and he knows that it is not a raven, it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are we concerned only for ravens?!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> "Ha'Orev l'Mino (the raven and its related species)" includes the Zarzir (starling) and the white Sanunis (swallow).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> People of Timrasa eat Zarzir, because it has a crop. People of Galil eat white Sanunis, because its stomach can be peeled!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> They will ultimately be punished for this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he must know that it is not a raven, and not a related species.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> The law is, if a bird has a Siman, it is assumed to be Tahor, as long as it is not Dores (Rashi; Tosfos - if the Siman is that it is not Dores.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> This argues with Rav Nachman!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Ameimar:</span> Yes! The only Tamei species that is not Dores is Peres or Ozniyah. These are not found in settled areas, so we are not concerned for them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A bird that scratches may be used for Taharas Metzora (i.e. it is Tahor). This is the white Sanunis that R. Eliezer and Chachamim argued about.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1  (Ameimar):</span> If the stomach is white, all agree that it is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about a Yarok (yellow, or perhaps green) stomach. R. Eliezer forbids, and Chachamim permit. The Halachah follows R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mar Zutra):</span> If the stomach is Yarok, all agree that it is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue when the stomach is white. R. Eliezer forbids, and Chachamim permit. The Halachah follows Chachamim. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>According to Mar Zutra, they argue about a white stomach. We understand R. Eliezer in the Beraisa. "Ha'Orev l'Mino" includes the white Sanunis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Ameimar, all agree that if the stomach is white, it is permitted. What does R. Eliezer forbid in the Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He forbids it when the stomach is red;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He calls it white to show that he does not refer to the species that dwells in houses, which is black. (R. Gershom - all forbid that species.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SPECIES OF TORIM AND DOVES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rachbah):</span> Tasil is a species of dove. It is not a Tor. (Therefore, it is acceptable for a Korban only when it is young);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Atzifi and Torim of Rachbah (kinds of turtle-doves) are species of Torim, and not of doves. (They are acceptable for Korbanos only when they are old.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Daniel bar Rav Katina - Mishnah):</span> Any bird that drinks from Mei Chatas (water Mekudash with ashes of the Parah Adumah) disqualifies it, except for a dove, since doves suck the water (and do not return it.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">62b----------------------------------------62b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Tasil is a species of dove, the Mishnah should say that also Tasil does not disqualify the water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Tasil sucks the water and returns it. (This disqualifies the water.) Doves suck the water and do not return it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Kufshani (turtle-doves) of Tzutzaini are the Torim of Rachbah. They are valid for Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> (For the Parah Adumah we use plain) "Ezov (hyssop)", but not the following kinds of Ezov:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Of Yavan; blue Ezov (Aruch; Rambam - Ezov of Kuchli); of Romi; wild Ezov; any Ezov with an accompanying name. (Likewise, Torim of Rachbah should be invalid!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> An accompanying name disqualifies only if that name existed when the Torah was given.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah specified the generic name to disqualify all other varieties.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The other name for Torim arose after the Torah was given.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> In Tzutzaini, Kufshani of Tzutzaini are simply called Torim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OTHER SPECIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Karzei (Rashi - locusts; Tosfos - very small birds) found in nettles (a small plant) are permitted. Those found in cabbage are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> If one eats the latter he is lashed, for they are Sheretz ha'Of (flying swarming creatures.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Tzarda is permitted. Barda is forbidden. Marda is doubtful. (These are types of birds.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> We are in doubt about eight birds - Chuva, Chuga, Suga, Harnuga, Tushlami, Marda, Kuchilna, and Bar Nafcha. (A possible translation of them, in order - Baillon's crake, spotted crake, a type of Chuva, corn orake, water rail, purple gallinula, a bird similar to Marda, and moorhen.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One Siman is that the stomach can be peeled. In these birds, it can be peeled only with a knife, but not by hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel had a (dead) goose. Its stomach could not be peeled. After it was in the sun for a while, it could be peeled! (Even though the stomach is too hard to be peeled, this is not a Siman of Tum'ah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In these birds, even after the stomach softens, it cannot be peeled by hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Marda (one of the eight doubtful birds) is the rooster of the swamp.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The rooster of the swamp is forbidden. The hen of the swamp (a different species) is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mereimar):</span> Subsequently, Chachamim saw the hen of the swamp be Dores. They forbade it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>(The identity of many of the following birds is unclear.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Shevor Andrafta is permitted. Piruz Andrafta is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Bunya is permitted. Parva is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Mardu Zagid v'Achil is permitted. Sagid v'Achil is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Shasya Chamra and Mazga Chamra are forbidden. Bas Mazga Chamra is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A red flamingo with long legs is permitted. If it has short legs, it is forbidden.</p></div>
