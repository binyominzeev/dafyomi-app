<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Suggestion:</span> Beis Shamai say that he must clean his mouth, but he need not wash. Beis Hillel say that he must wash, but he need not clean his mouth.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Suggestion:</span> Beis Shamai say that it suffices to clean his mouth (or he may wash, which is better). Beis Hillel say that he must wash. Cleaning the mouth does not suffice. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Zeira taught that bread must be used to clean the mouth. Does he teach according to Beis Shamai?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, Beis Shamai say that he must clean his mouth, but he need not wash. Beis Hillel says that he must also wash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, this should be taught (in Maseches Idiyos) among the laws in which Beis Shamai are lenient and Beis Hillel are stringent!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Beis Shamai say that he cleans his mouth. The same applies to washing (he must do both; Rashba - he may do either);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, he washes. The same applies to cleaning;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Each said a different law. They do not argue.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Bread must be used to clean the mouth.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It must be wheat bread, but not barley bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The bread must be cold. If it is hot, it will stick to his palate.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It must be soft, and not hard.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Halachah is, anything may be used, except for flour, dates and Yerek.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Asi):</span> How long must one wait between meat and cheese?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He need not wait at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Chisda taught that if one ate meat, he may not eat cheese (right away). If one ate cheese, he may eat meat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Asi asked how long must one wait between cheese and meat. R. Yochanan answered that he need not wait at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If one ate meat, he may not eat cheese (right away); if one ate cheese, he may eat meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Yosef):</span> Is meat stuck between teeth considered meat (to forbid one to eat cheese)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> "The meat was still between their teeth." (It is still considered meat.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Ukva):</span> I am (distasteful) like vinegar that comes from wine (my virtuous father). My father would not eat cheese for 24 hours after eating meat, but I eat cheese at the next meal! (Mar Ukva held that because his general level of piety was much lower than his father's, it was improper for him to be as stringent as his father.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> I am much worse at caring for my property than my father. He would oversee his property twice a day, I only oversee it once a day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one oversees his property every day, he profits from this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>Abaye would oversee his property every day. One day, he caught his sharecropper trying to steal wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>R. Asi would oversee his property every day. He was disappointed that he was not profiting from this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One day he saw water flowing out of an irrigation ditch, about to ruin his fruit. He was able to dam it up. He realized that it was worth looking every day for this one savings.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WASHING BEFORE AND AFTER A MEAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> Washing before the meal is a Mitzvah. Washing after the meal is (more) obligatory.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Washing before and after the meal is obligatory. Washing during the meal is Reshus (optional).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Washing before the meal is really a Mitzvah. The Tana calls it obligatory in comparison to Reshus (washing during the meal).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Washing before and after the meal is obligatory. Washing during the meal is Reshus;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may wash before the meal into a Kli, or on the ground;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Washing after the meal must be done into a Kli.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> One may not wash after the meal on the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the two versions?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about washing over pieces of wood. (They are not Kelim, yet this is not considered washing on the ground.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Washing before the meal may be done with hot or cold water. Washing after the meal must be with cold water, because hot water causes the filth to be absorbed in the hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Beraisa):</span> Washing before the meal may be with hot or cold water...</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">105b----------------------------------------105b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> One may not use water that is Yad Soledes Bo (one who touches it withdraws his hand).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa):</span> Washing after the meal may not be done with hot water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> If the water is not Yad Soledes Bo, it may be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Yad Soledes Bo water may be used to wash before the meal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Washing during the meal is Reshus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> This is only between similar courses (e.g. both meat). Washing between dairy and meat courses is obligatory.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah brei d'R. Chiya):</span> Washing after the meal is obligatory due to Sodom salt, which blinds the eyes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> A miniscule amount of such salt is found in a large amount of ;salt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If one measures out salt, must he wash his hands?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He certainly must!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> I used to think that we do not wash after the meal onto the ground due to the filth. My Rebbi (Rabah) taught that it is due to the evil spirit that rests on the water.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THINGS THAT ABAYE DID NOT KNOW</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> I used to think that the reason we do not take something from the table in front of someone who is drinking is lest he get angry. Rabah taught that it is due to the spirit of Tzarda (dazing spells).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is a problem only if the object is taken more than four Amos from the table, it is not returned, and it is something needed for the meal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Mar bar Rav Ashi was careful about grinders, because spices are needed for the meal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> I used to think that we gather crumbs for the sake of cleanliness. Rabah taught that it is to avoid poverty.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A certain man was always careful with crumbs. The angel appointed over poverty was never able to overcome him. One day, the man ate bread over grass. He dug up the area and threw the earth (including the crumbs) into the river. He heard the angel despair over its defeat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> I used to think that the reason we do not drink froth (on top of a liquid that was poured) is because it is repulsive. Rabah taught that it is because it leads to Karsam (a nasal drip and inflammation);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Drinking the froth leads to Karsam. Blowing it is bad for the head. Pushing it to the side leads to poverty.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Questions:</span> What should one do with it, and what is the remedy for Karsam?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> One should press the froth into the liquid until it settles;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> If the Karsam was caused by froth of wine, he should drink beer; if it was caused by froth of beer, he should drink water;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it was due to froth of water, there is no cure.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Poverty pursues a poor man! (Due to his poverty, he had only water to drink, and due to this he cannot be cured from the Karsam.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> I used to think that the reason we do not eat a vegetable straight from the bundle is because it appears gluttonous. Rabah taught that it makes one susceptible to witchcraft.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Chisda and Rabah bar Rav Huna were on a boat. A woman wanted to sit by them, but they refused. She said something that stopped the boat. They said something that allowed the boat to go.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">The woman:</span> I cannot harm you, because you do not clean yourselves (in the privy) with pottery, you do not kill lice on your clothing, and you do not eat vegetables straight from the bundle.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> I used to think that the reason we do not eat a vegetable that fell on the tray is because it is repulsive. Rabah taught that it leads to mouth odor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> I used to think that the reason we don't sit under gutter pipes is due to the water that flows down. Rabah taught that Mazikim (Shedim, which are beings with similarities to people and to angels) frequent the area.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Two men were carrying a barrel. They rested it under a gutter pipe. A Mazik broke it. Mar bar Rav Ashi excommunicated the Mazik. It came in front of Mar bar Rav Ashi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Mar bar Rav Ashi:</span> Why did you break the barrel?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">The Mazik:</span> I had no choice. I was sleeping there. They put it on my ear!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Mar bar Rav Ashi:</span> What were you doing in a place where many people go?! You acted improperly, so you must pay.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Mar bar Rav Ashi agreed to give it time to pay. The Mazik was late. It explained 'we may not take from what is wrapped, sealed, measured or counted.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> I used to think that the reason we spill water from the top of a barrel is due to chips of wood that float on top. Rabah taught that it is lest Mazikim drank from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There was a Shed that used to serve Rav Papa. It went to get water from the river. It delayed a long time, until the water on top flowed away. When it returned, it saw that in Rav Papa's house, they would spill out the top water. It had waited for naught.</p></div>
