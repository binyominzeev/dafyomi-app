<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> Did anyone teach Rav that an udder (that was cooked without tearing it) is forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Version #1 - Rav Kahana - Rav Yitzchak bar Avodimi: I did not teach that to him at all! Rather, he saw that people in Tatalfush cooked meat with milk, so he decreed this stringency.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Version #2 - R. Yosi bar Aba - Rav Yitzchak bar Avodimi: I taught him that an udder of a nursing cow (that was cooked without tearing it) is forbidden. The Mishnah discusses an udder of a cow that is not nursing;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Chiya taught Rav that an udder (that was cooked without tearing it) is forbidden. He expected Rav to realize that applies only to a nursing cow;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav thought that it applies to all udders.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rav Papi hosted Ravin and Rav Yitzchak bar Yosef. He served a dish with udders; Rav Yitzchak ate, but Ravin would not eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Ravin should have eaten! Rav Papi's father-in-law, R. Yitzchak Nafcha, is very careful about his deeds. If Rav Papi served it, surely he relied on what his father-in-law taught him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>In Sura, people did not eat udder. In Pumbadisa, they would eat it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHARP PEOPLE OF PUMBADISA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rami bar Tamri was from Pumbadisa. He came to Sura on Erev Yom Kipur, and saw everyone discarding udders. He gathered them and ate them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Why did you do so?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rami bar Tamri:</span> I come from Rav Yehudah's area, where we eat udder.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> One must observe the stringencies of where he comes from and where he is staying!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rami:</span> I ate them outside the Techum. (The area surrounding the city, it is considered an extension of the city).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> What fuel did you use to cook them?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rami:</span> I used grape skins.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Perhaps they were from Nochrim (and are forbidden like wine poured to idolatry)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Rami:</span> They were over 12 months old. (Dry grape skins are not forbidden.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Perhaps they were stolen!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Rami:</span> The owners despaired from them (so they were Hefker). They were moldy and growing prickly hairs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Why aren't you wearing Tefilin?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Rami:</span> I have a stomach sickness. Rav Yehudah exempts in such cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Why don't you have Tzitzis on your garment?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p><span class="cl">Rami:</span> It is borrowed. Rav Yehudah exempts a borrowed garment for 30 days.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A man was being tied to be lashed for not honoring his parents.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rami:</span> Release him! A Beraisa teaches that Beis Din does not punish for a Mitzvas Aseh if its reward is stated in the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> You are very sharp!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rami:</span> There are people in Pumbadisa, Rav Yehudah's area, sharper than myself.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>COOKING LIVER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Abaye sent Rav Safra to ask (in Eretz Yisrael) if (R. Tam - unsalted) liver may be cooked (in a pot).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Zerika (to Rav Safra):</span> I cooked liver for R. Ami, and he ate it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Safra told this to Abaye.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> I knew that the liver itself is permitted. I wanted to know if it forbids what it is cooked with.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Safra:</span> You knew from a Mishnah that the liver itself is permitted. The same Mishnah forbids what it is cooked with!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Liver forbids what it is cooked with, but it itself remains permitted, because it emits (blood), but does not absorb.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Perhaps only a forbidden liver (e.g. of a Terefah) forbids other food because it emits forbidden fat, but a permitted liver does not forbid (due to blood), nor does it become forbidden.</p></div>
