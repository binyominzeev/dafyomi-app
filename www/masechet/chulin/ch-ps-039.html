<p class="dedicationbox">CHULIN 31-43 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> If an animal was slaughtered with intent to be Zorek (to throw its blood) or to be Maktir (burn its Chelev) for idolatry, it is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Such improper intent in a Korban (Shechitah with intent to be Zorek or to be Maktir after the allowed time) disqualifies the Korban; we learn Chulin from Kodshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> The animal is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Such improper intent in a Korban does not disqualify the Korban. We do not learn Chulin from Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish are consistent with what they said elsewhere.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> If a Chatas was slaughtered Lishmah (to be a Chatas), but with intent to throw its blood Lo Lishmah (for the sake of a different Korban), the Korban is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The Korban is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan disqualifies. The corresponding case of Pigul (Shechitah with intent to be Zorek or to be Maktir after the allowed time) disqualifies the Korban. We learn Lo Lishmah from Pigul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish is Machshir. The corresponding case of Pigul does not disqualify the Korban. We do not learn Lo Lishmah from Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>It was necessary to teach that R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish argue in both cases;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had we taught only about Shechitah for idolatry, one might have thought that only there Reish Lakish argues, because we do not learn Chulin from Kodshim, but he agrees with R. Yochanan that we learn Lo Lishmah from Pigul, since both are Kodshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had we taught only about Lo Lishmah, one might have thought that only there R. Yochanan argues, but he agrees with Reish Lakish about idolatry, for we do not learn Chulin from Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against both of them - Rav Sheshes - Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that the Shechitah is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In Kodshim, (improper) intention disqualifies a Korban, yet we are concerned only for the intention of the Oved. In Chulin, intention does not disqualify Shechitah, all the more so we are concerned only for the intention of the Shochet!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of 'in Chulin, intention does not disqualify Shechitah'?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Any intent at all does not forbid Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, how does an animal offered to idolatry become forbidden?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it means that Chulin are not disqualified if one Avodah (e.g. Shechitah) was done with intent to do another Avodah for idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>In Kodshim, one Avodah done with intention to do another Avodah with improper intention disqualifies a Korban, and still, we are concerned only for the intention of the Oved (the one who serves);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>In Chulin, such intention does not Posel the Korban. All the more so we should be concerned only for the intention of the Shochet!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> The Beraisa says that in Kodshim, one Avodah done with intention to do another Avodah with improper intention disqualifies a Korban. This opposes Reish Lakish;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It says that in Chulin, such intention does not Posel the Korban. This opposes R. Yochanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1 (for Reish Lakish):</span> Reish Lakish gave his opinion before R. Yochanan taught him (the Mishnah, or R. Yochanan's own opinion).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 2 (for R. Yochanan - Rav Sheshes):</span> R. Yochanan explains the Mishnah as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In Kodshim, (improper) intention in any of the four Avodos involving the blood disqualifies the Korban, yet we are concerned only about the intention of the Oved;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In Chulin, there are only two Avodos in which intent forbids the animal. All the more so we should be concerned only for the intention of the Shochet!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>LATER ACTIONS THAT REVEAL ONE'S INTENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A Beraisa supports R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one slaughters an animal intending to be Zorek or to be Maktir to idolatry, this is Takroves (an animal offered to idolatry). It is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A case occurred in which someone slaughtered and then intended to throw or be Maktir to idolatry. Chachamim did not rule to permit or forbid it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> They did not forbid, due to respect for Chachamim's opinion. They did not rule to permit, out of respect for R. Eliezer's opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We need not say that Chachamim would permit this, nor that R. Eliezer would forbid it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim permit (in the Mishnah) because we did not hear that he intends for idolatry. Here, we know that now he intends for idolatry. This proves that also the Shechitah was for idolatry!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer forbids only regarding an idolater, for (presumably) all his deeds are for idolatry. He would not say so about a Yisrael!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Rav Shizbi):</span> Rather, they did not rule to permit due to respect for R. Shimon ben Gamliel's opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which teaching of R. Shimon ben Gamliel does he refer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He refers to his teaching about a Get.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a healthy man said 'write a Get to my wife', he is only teasing her (since he did not say to give it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A case occurred in which a healthy man said 'write a Get to my wife', went up to the roof and fell to his death;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if he intentionally jumped off, the Get is valid. If the wind blew him off, it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The case brought contradicts the law just taught!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It should say 'if his later actions prove that he really wanted to give the Get, it is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>A case occurred in which a healthy man said 'write a Get to my wife', went up to the roof and fell to his death. R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if he intentionally jumped, the Get is valid. If the wind blew him, it is invalid.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That case is different, since he initially told them to write a Get. Here, when he slaughtered, there was no indication that this was for idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> He refers to his teaching about a gift.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven wrote a document giving all his property (which included slaves) to Shimon, and Shimon said 'I do not want the property', if Shimon is a Kohen, the slaves may eat Terumah. (They are his slaves);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, once he says 'I do not want the property', Reuven's heirs acquire it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the first Tana hold that Shimon acquires the property in spite of his protests?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> If Shimon protested from the beginning, all agree that he does not acquire. If he was quiet, and later protested, all agree that he acquired;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>They argue when Levi received the document on behalf of Shimon, and Shimon was initially silent and then protested.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The first Tana holds that his initial silence shows that he consented to acquire. He later reconsidered and protested. This has no effect;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel holds that his later protest reveals that from the beginning, he did not want to acquire. At first, he felt no need to protest, since he did not take the document.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Some Nochrim gave rams to Yisrael Shochtim. They said 'you can keep the meat and skin, just give us the blood and Chelev.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Tuvi bar Rav Masnah):</span> Are the animals forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> No, because the Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> According to R. Eliezer, if a Nochri gave money to a Yisrael Shochet for some meat from an animal, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> If the Nochri is powerful (and the Yisrael cannot avoid giving the meat to him), the animal is forbidden. If he is not, the meat is permitted. (The Yisrael need not give the meat to him. This shows that he slaughters for himself.)</p></div>
