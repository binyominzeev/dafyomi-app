<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>EXPOUNDING NAMES WRITTEN AS TWO WORDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Kedar La'omer (Melech Eilam) is also written as two words! (Pischei Teshuvah YD 275:8 - the Chasam Sofer says that our tradition is unlike the Gemara. We write it like one word.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His name is written as two words, but they must be on the same line. "Bas ha'Ya'anah" may be written on two lines.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SIMANIM OF TAMEI BIRDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chachamim said, any bird...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Gamliel):</span> Any bird that is Dores (Rashi - holds its food in its claws while eating; R. Tam - eats its prey before it dies) is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it (Rashi - is not Dores and) has an extra toe, a crop, and the stomach can be peeled, it is Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok says, we prepare a string for it to perch on:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it puts two toes in front and two in back, it is Tamei. If it puts three in front and one in back, it is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, any bird that catches food (that is thrown to it) in the air is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> Some Tahor birds do this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> If it catches and eats the food in midair, it is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Others say, if it dwells with Tamei birds, it is Tamei. If it dwells with Tahor birds, it is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Others hold like R. Eliezer, who says that Zarzir dwells with ravens because it is a species of raven (it is Tamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Others can hold even like Chachamim. They mean that a bird that dwells with Tamei birds and resembles them is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SIMANIM OF LOCUSTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any Chagav (locust... that has wings that cover the majority...)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which majority must they cover?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They must cover most of its length.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They must cover most of its circumference.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> We must be concerned for both versions. It is forbidden unless both majorities are covered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If it doesn't have legs for jumping, but will grow them later, like the Zachal species, it is permitted (if it has the other Simanim);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Yosi says, "Asher Lo Kera'ayim" - even if it lacks them now, but will grow them later it is permitted. ("Lo" is written with an Aleph, which connotes 'does not have'. A tradition from Sinai teaches that it is pronounced as if it were written with a Vav, to connote 'it has'. Nowadays, most traditions of pronunciation do not distinguish these.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> 'Zachal' is the species called 'Askrin'.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>HOW WE LEARN WHICH LOCUSTS ARE TAHOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "These you may eat... Arbeh Sal'am Chargol Chagav" - these refer (respectively) to red locust, yellow locust, gray locust (or long-horned Chagav) and small white locust (alternatively - Chagav is a general term for many species of locusts).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "l'Minehu" (or "l'Mino") after each of them. These include Tzipores Keramim, Yuchna Yerushalmis, Artzuviya, and Razbanis respectively.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> The Torah taught here extra Kelalim and Peratim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Arbeh" is red locust. "L'Mino" includes Tzipores Keramim.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">65b----------------------------------------65b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had the Torah written only this, we would have learned (from the Klal Prat u'Chlal) species that have no Gabachas (Rashi - bald head; Aruch - hump);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include species with a Gabachas?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Sal'am l'Minehu" includes them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Had the Torah written only Arbeh and Sal'am, we would include species with or without a Gabachas, but only if they do not have a tail;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include species with a tail?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Chargol l'Minehu" includes them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>This teaches only species with or without a Gabachas, with or without a tail, which do not have a long head.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include species with a long head?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah of (what is common to) these three species:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Each has different Simanim. The Tzad ha'Shavah is that they have four legs, four wings, extra legs for jumping, and the wings cover the majority of the body.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tzirtzur has all these. Perhaps also it is Tahor!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Chagav" teaches that it must be called Chagav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If it depends on being called Chagav, perhaps the above Simanim are not needed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "L'Minehu" teaches that it must also have the Simanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achai):</span> Arbeh, Sal'am and Chargol all have short heads. We cannot learn to species with long heads!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since they all have the four Simanim, we are not concerned about the head.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why did the Torah write "Chargol"? We should learn from Arbeh and Sal'am, since they have all four Simanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rather, we cannot learn from Arbeh and Sal'am, since they have no tail. Likewise, we cannot learn (species with long heads) from species with short heads!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Achai):</span> Rather, Sal'am is extra, for we could have learned it from Arbeh and Chargol;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They are both Tahor, even though Arbeh has a tail and Chargol has a Gabachas. Also Sal'am is Tahor, even though it has a tail and Gabachas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since Sal'am is extra, it teaches that a species (with the other Simanim) is Tahor even if its head is long.</p></div>
