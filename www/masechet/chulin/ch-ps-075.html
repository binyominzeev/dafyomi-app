<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IS A BEN PEKU'AH AN INDEPENDENT ANIMAL?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the slaughtered mother becomes Tamei, does the Ben Peku'ah become a Rishon (first-degree) l'Tumah with its mother, or does it become a Sheni l'Tumah from its mother?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> It becomes a Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> It becomes a Rishon. The mother is like a protective shell around it. They become Tamei together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish - Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> The fetus is like meat that touched a Nevelah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim say, it is like meat that touched a slaughtered Terefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to me (Reish Lakish), we understand why the fetus is Huchshar. It and its mother are considered to be one animal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>You (R. Yochanan) consider the fetus to be separate. How did it become Huchshar?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Shimon, who says that Shechitah is Machshir. (Since Shechitah permits (the mother and) the fetus, it is also Machshir the fetus.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> If a Ben Peku'ah passed through a river, it became Huchshar. If it walked through a cemetery, it became Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to me, we understand why it is not Huchshar (through its mother's Shechitah, rather,) until it goes through the river, for it is considered distinct from its mother;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>You (Reish Lakish) hold that they are like one animal. It should be Huchshar due to the Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, no blood exuded when the mother was slaughtered. The Beraisa is unlike R. Shimon (who says that Shechitah itself is Machshir).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa, who holds that a Ben Peku'ah can become Huchshar and Tamei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It is R. Yosi ha'Gelili;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> A Ben Peku'ah can receive Tum'as Ochlim. It needs Hechsher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, it is alive, and anything alive cannot receive Tum'as Ochlim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>This is consistent with another teaching of R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yosi ha'Gelili and Beis Shamai agree about this matter.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Fish are Mekabel Tum'ah from when they are trapped;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, it is from when they die;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Akiva says, it is from when they cannot survive.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between R. Akiva and Beis Hillel (Rashi; Tosfos - between R. Akiva and Beis Shamai)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> They argue about a fish that is jumping around. (Rashi - However, it dried up and it will die; Tosfos - it was trapped, but it could survive.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> Does R. Akiva consider Terefah fish to be unable to live?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We can ask this according to either opinion regarding Terefah animals;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>According to the opinion that Terefah animals can live, since fish have less vitality, perhaps Terefah fish cannot live.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>According to the opinion that Terefah animals cannot live, perhaps since Shechitah does not apply to fish, Terefos do not apply, either.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CHELEV OF FETUSES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> If an animal miscarried, the Chelev of the child is forbidden like Chelev of a Behemah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> It is permitted, like Chelev of a Chayah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan holds that since it was born, the fetus is considered a Behemah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish says, it is considered a Behemah only if it was born after the full term (of pregnancy.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> If it miscarried before the full term, all permit the Chelev;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about Chelev extracted from a living fetus after the full term.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is like Chelev of a Behemah, since the fetus had full development;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> It is permitted, because the fetus was not born.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> Chelev and the kidneys of an Asham are Huktar (burned on the Mizbe'ach). We are never Maktir Chelev of a fetus (inside an Asham, for it is always a male);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn to all Korbanos (even females), that Chelev of a fetus is not offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is like my opinion, that Chelev of a fetus is forbidden (like the rest of the Chelev of the animal). Therefore we must learn that it is not offered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>According to you, it is permitted. Surely, it is not offered!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> I learn from here. Surely, the Chelev is not offered because it is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> Chelev and the kidneys of an Asham are Huktar. We are not Maktir Chelev of a fetus;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn to all Korbanos that Chelev of a fetus is not offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is like my opinion, that Chelev of a fetus is permitted. Therefore, it is not offered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>According to you, it is forbidden. Why can't it be offered?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> (Every part of) the fetus is like an animal less than eight days old, which is too young to be offered.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SHECHITAH OF A TEREFAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If one slaughters a Terefah and finds a full term fetus inside:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In our Mishnah, R. Meir forbids (a Ben Peku'ah until it is slaughtered. Therefore), he permits this fetus through Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim, who permit in our Mishnah, forbid this fetus, even if it is slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All permit this fetus through its own Shechitah. The Torah permits a fetus through Shechitah of its mother (if she is Kosher) or through its own Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If one slaughters a Terefah and finds a full term fetus inside, the child must be slaughtered, and the foreleg, jaw and stomach (Matanos to the Kohen) must be given;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">75b----------------------------------------75b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If it dies, it does not Metamei b'Masa (i.e. one who moves it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> You require the child to be slaughtered. This is like R. Meir;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>How can you say that if it dies, it does not Metamei b'Masa? That is like Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Chisda - Beraisa - R. Chiya):</span> If one slaughters a Terefah and finds a full term fetus inside, the child must be slaughtered, and Matanos must be given;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it dies, it does not Metamei b'Masa.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Summation of counter-question):</span> The child must be slaughtered. This is like R. Meir. If it dies, it is not Metamei b'Masa. This is like Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> In the Seifa, the fetus died before the mother was slaughtered. R. Meir admits in that case.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah, to Rav Chisda):</span> You did not give that answer. How do you answer (question (e))?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> Chachamim permit a fetus through Shechitah of its mother (if she is Kosher) or through its own Shechitah. (When the mother is Terefah, they agree that the only Heter is through Shechitah of the child.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Zeira taught like Rav Chisda.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Asi:</span> Very good! Also R. Yochanan taught like this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> (R. Asi did not say that also Reish Lakish taught like this, even though he always learned with R. Yochanan.) Presumably, Reish Lakish argues!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rejection:</span> Reish Lakish normally waits before contesting R. Yochanan's teachings. R. Asi did not wait to see whether he argued.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rejection:</span> Reish Lakish was drinking when R. Yochanan taught this. R. Asi did not wait to see whether he argued.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>A BEN PEKU'AH THAT GREW UP</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Shimon Shezuri says...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> They argue in a case that the child stepped on the floor. (Chachamim decree that it must be slaughtered, lest people come to eat (regular) animals without Shechitah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Mesharshiya):</span> According to Chananya (who says that the father partially influences status of the child), if a Ben Peku'ah mates with a normal female, even Shechitah does not permit the child. (It is as if the child is half slaughtered. There is no way to complete the Shechitah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Abaye):</span> Chachamim agree that a Ben Peku'ah with unsplit hooves does not need Shechitah, even if it stepped on the ground;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because people remember bizarre things. (They will remember that it was a Ben Peku'ah. They will not think that animals do not need Shechitah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Abaye):</span> If a Ben Peku'ah with unsplit hooves was found inside a (Shach - regular; Bach - Ben Peku'ah) mother with unsplit hooves, Chachamim agree that the child does not need Shechitah, even if it stepped on the ground;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>People remember doubly bizarre things. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon Shezuri. He permits all offspring of a Ben Peku'ah (without Shechitah) for all generations;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is permitted. Its child is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Ada bar Chabo had a Ben Peku'ah that was Nidras by a wolf.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Go slaughter it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Ada bar Chabo:</span> Ze'iri said that the Halachah follows R. Shimon Shezuri (Shechitah is not needed even for the offspring)! Also R. Yochanan does not require slaughtering a Ben Peku'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> R. Yochanan said that only according to R. Shimon Shezuri. (The Halachah follows Chachamim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Ada bar Chabo:</span> Ravin said that the Halachah follows R. Shimon Shezuri wherever he appears in the Mishnayos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> I hold like R. Yonason, that the Halachah follows him only regarding a dangerously sick man and Terumas Ma'aser of Demai (doubtfully tithed produce).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> At first, if a man said only 'write a Get for my wife', (we would write it, but) we would give it only of he was being taken to his execution;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Later, they said that we give it also if he was departing on a boat or with a caravan;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Shimon Shezuri says, we give it also if he was dangerously sick.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon Shezuri):</span> If Terumas Ma'aser was separated on Demai, and it became mixed with the (99 parts of) Demai it was separated for, even if this was not on Shabbos, the seller (of the Demai) is believed to say that he had separated Ma'aser. (If so, the buyer's separation was void, and the mixture is permitted.)</p></div>
