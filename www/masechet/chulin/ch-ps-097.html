<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ESTIMATING NESINAS TA'AM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Chelev really forbid the rest of the animal?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A case occurred in which a kid was roasted with its Chelev, and R. Yochanan permitted it, except for the areas around the Chelev!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It was a thin kid. (Its Chelev does not spread, or it did not have enough Chelev to give Ta'am to the kid.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna bar Yehudah):</span> The case was, a kidney was cooked with its Chelev. R. Yochanan permitted the kidney.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravin bar Rav Ada):</span> A kidney was cooked in a pot with its Chelev. R. Yochanan said that a Kefeila (Nochri chef) should see if he tastes Chelev in the kidney.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> One may not cook milk in a pot in which meat was cooked;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he did, and the milk absorbed the Ta'am of meat, the milk is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One may not cook Chulin in a pot in which Terumah was cooked;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he did, and the Terumah gave taste to the Chulin, the Chulin must be eaten (by a Kohen, in Taharah,) like Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Granted, regarding Terumah, a Kohen may taste the food.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> However, one may not taste the milk. Perhaps it is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We rely on a Kefeila, like R. Yochanan said (above).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Sometimes, Chachamim say that we taste food (to see if it absorbed taste). Sometimes, we rely on a Kefeila. Sometimes, we say that an Isur is Batel if and only if it was mixed with 60 times its own volume of Heter (permitted food):</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">97b----------------------------------------97b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If diverse foods were mixed, and all are permitted to (some) Yisrael, the Yisrael tastes it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If diverse foods were mixed, and one of them is forbidden to all Yisraelim, a Kefeila tastes it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>In the following two cases an Isur is Batel in 60 times its own volume;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It was mixed b'Mino (with Heter that tastes the same);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If was mixed b'Eino Mino (with Heter that tastes differently), and a Kefeila is not available.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>FORBIDDEN ABSORPTIONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Some thighs were salted with the Gid ha'Nasheh inside. Ravina forbade them, and Rav Acha permitted them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> My father permits them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha, to Ravina):</span> Do you forbid them because Shmuel taught that salted food is like Rose'ach (boiling hot), and pickling is like cooking?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel forbade the thigh only if it was cooked with the Gid. If it was roasted, it suffices to peel off the layer around the Gid!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shmuel said that salted food is like Rose'ach. Perhaps he means that it is like cooking.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since he said that pickling is like cooking, we infer that salting is not, rather it is like roasting.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is left difficult (for Ravina). (Text of the She'iltos, cited in the margin, is - we can learn from here (like Rav Acha and Rav Ashi).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> When estimating whether an Isur (Tosfos - a forbidden absorption in a pot) is a 60th of the mixture, we include the gravy, the sediment, the solid pieces, and the pot.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> 'The pot' refers to (the volume of the walls of) the pot itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> 'The pot' refers to the Heter absorbed in the walls of the pot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> If an Isur became mixed with other food, and we cannot test whether or not it gives Ta'am (since both have the same taste, or no one here is permitted to taste it), we gauge whether the same volume (as the Isur) of onions or leeks would give taste to the mixture.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba):</span> Perhaps we should gauge using peppers or spices. Even minute quantities of them give taste!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Chachamim gauged that no Isur gives taste more than onions and leeks. (The Rashash asked that there are forbidden peppers or spices, e.g. of Orlah, that give taste to 1000 times their volume.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Gid ha'Nasheh does not forbid a mixture 60 times its own size. It itself is not counted towards 60 parts of mixture;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A (cooked) udder does not forbid a mixture 60 times its own size. It itself is counted towards the 60 (parts of mixture);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>An egg does not forbid a mixture 60 times its own size. It itself is not counted towards the 60.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak brei d'Rav Mesharshiya):</span> The udder itself is forbidden. If it falls into another pot, it forbids that pot (if it is more than one part in 60).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must the first pot have 60 times the volume of the entire udder (to be permitted), or only what exuded from it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be 60 times the entire udder. We do not know how much exuded!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, if the udder falls into another pot, it should not forbid it (since we assume that all the forbidden taste left the udder)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the udder itself becomes forbidden, we view it like a Nevelah (which is always forbidden, and forbids mixtures).</p></div>
