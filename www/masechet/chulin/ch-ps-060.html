<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ONE WHO DID NOT FATHOM HASH-M'S GREATNESS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Kaiser:</span> I want to see your G-d.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Chananyah:</span> You cannot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Kaiser insisted. On a summer day, R. Yehoshua asked him to look at the sun.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Kaiser:</span> I cannot.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> The sun is a creation of Hash-m, and you cannot look at it. All the more so, you cannot see Hash-m Himself!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Kaiser:</span> I want to prepare a meal for Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> You cannot. His legions are too numerous.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Kaiser insisted. R. Yehoshua told him to prepare it on the bank of a certain river.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Kaiser prepared for six months in summer. A wind came, and blew all he had prepared into the river.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Kaiser prepared for six months in winter. Rain came, and washed all he had prepared into the river.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Kaiser:</span> What is happening?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Those who clean the floor in front of Hash-m consumed it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Kaiser:</span> I cannot prepare a meal for Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Kaiser's daughter:</span> Your G-d is a carpenter - "He makes a ceiling with water in His upper chambers." Tell Him make for me a weaving rod.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehoshua agreed. He prayed, and she became leprous. It was customary in Rome to seat a leper in the market and to give him a weaving rod, so people will know to pray for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Hash-m gave you a nice rod!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Kaiser's daughter:</span> Ask Him to take it back.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Hash-m gives. He does not take.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HASH-M'S CREATIONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> All the following should be large in an ox - the belly, hooves, head and tail;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All of these should be small in a donkey.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is relevant to commerce. (If one sells an ox or donkey, it should meet these specifications.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The ox that Adam offered had one horn on its forehead - "will be more pleasing to Hash-m than a bull Makrin (with horns) and hooves."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Makrin" is plural. This implies that it had two horns!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Although it is read "Makrin", it is written without a Yud, to connote the singular.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Adam offered an ox whose horns preceded (came up from the ground before) its hooves. The above verse mentions the horns before the hooves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>(This implies that it was created mature, with horns.) This supports R. Yehoshua ben Levi (regarding full stature):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Everything created in the six days of creation was created in is full stature, with its consent, and in its beauty - "Heaven and earth were finished, and all Tzeva'am (their legions)." We may read this 'Tzivyonam' (their (full) beauty, and the form they chose.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> When Hash-m created the trees, he commanded that each species sprout by itself. The grass reasoned: even though it is the nature of trees to grow far apart, Hash-m insisted that they keep separate. It is the nature of grass to grow mixed together, all the more so each species should keep separate!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Each species sprouted by itself. The world minister (the angel Metatron) exclaimed "Hash-m's honor will be forever. Hash-m will exult in his works."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> According to R. Chanina bar Papa, may one graft different species of grass onto each other?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since the Torah did not say that each must grow by itself, this should be permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since Hash-m agreed to the grass' Kal va'Chomer, it is as if the Torah wrote that each must be separate!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> It says "Hash-m made the two great luminaries", and it says "the great luminary... and the small luninary"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> Initially, Hash-m made them both great. The moon objected 'two kings cannot share one crown!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> Go diminish yourself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">The moon:</span> Is this fitting for my proper suggestion?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> You will rule (illuminate) day and night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">The moon:</span> A small light is useless during the day!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> Yisrael will count days and years through you.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">The moon:</span> They need the sun to calculate the seasons. This determines (leap) years!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> Great Tzadikim will be called small, like yourself - Yakov, David, and Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>The moon was still not consoled. Hash-m decreed to bring an 'atonement' for Himself (i.e. to appease the moon) for having diminished the moon.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> This is why it says in the Musaf of Rosh Chodesh "Chatas la'Shem."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Asi):</span> It says "the ground brought grass" on the third day, but it says "No tree...(or grass) had yet sprouted" on Erev Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Asi):</span> This teaches that the grass was just below the ground, until Adam prayed for it. Then, rain fell and it sprouted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This teaches that Hash-m desires the prayers of Tzadikim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Rav Nachman bar Papa had a garden. He planted seeds, but nothing grew. He prayed. Rain came and it sprouted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> This teaches like Rav Asi. (Hash-m desired my prayer.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SURPRISING THINGS WE LEARN FROM THE TORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan bar Aba):</span> The Shesu'ah is a unique creation. It has two backs and two spines. (Some say that it is a species. Others say that it is an aberation, like a Siamese twin.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was Moshe a hunter, that he would know about such exotic creatures?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, this proves that he received the Torah from Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "the five Plishtim rulers - of Aza, of Ashdod, of Ashkelon, of Gas, of Akron, and of Avim", but six are listed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> Five of them were imporant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav):</span> The Avim were not Plishtim. They came from Teiman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> The Avim came from Teiman;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They are called Avim because they corrupted (Ivsu) their place, or because they desired (Ivu) many gods, or because anyone who saw them was seized with Avis (trembling.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> They have 16 rows of teeth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Many verses seem to be pointless, but teach important lessons.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>"The Avim dwell in Chatzerim, until Aza (...Kaftorim took their land)" teaches why Yisrael were permitted to take their land.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Avraham had sworn to Avimelech (king of the Plishtim) not to harm him or his children or grandchildren. Hash-m caused the Kaftorim to take the land from the Avim, permitting Yisrael to take it from the Kaftorim. (This is like R. Yochanan, who says that Avim were Plishtim. Also according to Rav, Yisrael were forbidden to take the Avim's land, for they descend from Esav. Hash-m said that Yisrael may not take Esav's land - Devarim 2:5.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Similarly, "Sichon Melech ha'Emori... fought b'Melech Mo'av" teaches why Yisrael could take that land.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Yisrael were forbidden to fight Mo'av. Hash-m caused Sichon to take the land from Mo'av, so Yisrael could take it from Sichon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Yisrael was permitted to take the lands of Amon and Mo'av because they were conquered by Sichon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Tzidonim call Chermon 'Siryon' (and the Emoriyim call it 'Senir')" - Senir and Siryon are mountains of Eretz Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This teaches that every nation built a great city and gave it the name of a mountain of Eretz Yisrael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This teaches that even the mountains of Eretz Yisrael are dear to the nations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>"(Yosef) transferred the Mitzriyim to the cities" - he exiled them, so they would not look down on his brothers, who were exiled from their land.</p></div>
