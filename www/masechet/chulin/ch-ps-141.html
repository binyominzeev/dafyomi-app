<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there was only one chick...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should require "Efrochim Oh Al Beitzim" (plural), and expound "Kan" to include even chicks that can flutter or Muzarim eggs!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If so, the Torah should have said "Rovetzes Aleihem";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it says "Rovetzes Al Efrochim Oh Al Beitzim" to equate chicks and eggs. (Just like the chicks hatched, the eggs must be capable of hatching. Just like the eggs need the mother, also the chicks.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE ASEH TO SEND THE MOTHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sent the mother and it returned, he must send it again, even four or five times - "Shale'ach Teshalach."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one says 'I will take the mother and send the chicks', he is liable (Rashi - for taking the mother; Ramban - he must send the mother) - "Shale'ach Teshalach Es ha'Em."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he took the offspring and returned them, and the mother returned, he is exempt from sending the mother (Rashi - and he may take them again).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We should expound "Shale'ach" to teach once, and "Teshalach" to teach a second time, but not more!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Shale'ach" connotes even 100 times;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that one may take the mother for a Mitzvah (e.g. Taharas Metzora). "Teshalach" obligates sending it, even if it is needed for a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> If not for "Teshalach," one might have thought that one may take the mother for a Mitzvah. Taking the mother is forbidden by an Aseh and a Lav. An Aseh does not override them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, he already took the mother. He already transgressed the Lav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is only an Aseh to send the mother. If not for "Teshalach," the other Aseh would override the Aseh to send.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> (A Beraisa explains when one is lashed for a Lav ha'Nitak l'Aseh, i.e. it can be "fixed" through performing an Aseh.) Our answer is like the opinion that the Beraisa says that he is not lashed if he (Rashi - immediately; Ramban - can) fulfill(s) the Aseh. He is lashed if he does not fulfill it (Rashi - right away; Rambam - if it becomes impossible to fulfill it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to the opinion that he is not lashed unless he is Mevatel (makes it impossible to fulfill) the Aseh, he transgresses the Lav only when he slaughters it (so Answer #1 does not apply)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> R. Yehudah says that "Shale'ach" applies only before taking the mother. If he took it, there is no obligation to send it. How does he expound "Teshalach"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, he took the mother intending to send it (and now he wants to keep it for a Mitzvah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is no Lav to do so, only the Aseh to send it. One might have thought that the other Mitzvah overrides the Aseh to send it. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should we think that one Aseh overrides another?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shalom is so great that the Torah permits erasing Hash-m's name in order to permit a woman (who became a Sotah) to her husband;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Metzora is forbidden to have relations with his wife until he brings the birds - "v'Yoshav mi'Chutz l'Ohalo Shiv'as Yamim."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One might have thought that one may keep the bird if needed to be Metaher a Metzora. "Teshalach" teaches that in any case he must send it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>LASHES FOR TRANSGRESSING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If one takes the mother from her young, he does not send it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, he sends it and is not lashed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The general rule is, we do not lash for any Lav ha'Nitak l'Aseh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Aba bar Mamal) Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Does he hold that one is always lashed for a Lav ha'Nitak l'Aseh?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, does he (normally) exempt from lashes;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Here he is lashed, because he holds that the Mitzvah to send precedes the Lav. It does not correct it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A thief or robber is lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mitzvah "v'Heshiv Es ha'Gezelah" corrects the Lav "Lo Sigzol." We conclude that R. Yehudah holds that one is lashed for a Lav ha'Nitak l'Aseh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Zeira):</span> We may not bring (proofs or) refutations from Beraisos that were not authenticated by R. Chiya and R. Oshaya. Perhaps they are mistaken.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">141b----------------------------------------141b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Chiya and R. Oshaya):</span> R. Yehudah says that if someone went back to take Shichechah, or harvested his entire field (without leaving Pe'ah), he is lashed (even though these are corrected by leaving what he took for the poor)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Yehudah holds that the Mitzvah to leave Matanos for the poor applies only before taking them. (The Lav is not Nitak l'Aseh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "You may not leave over (from Korban Pesach) until morning. You will burn what is left over" - the Torah gives an Aseh after the Lav, to exempt from lashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> He exempts from lashes for a Lav ha'Nitak l'Aseh. He is lashed for taking the mother, because he holds that the Aseh precedes the Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Idi - Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If one takes the mother from her young he is lashed. He does not send it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he was Mechayev lashes for a Lav ha'Nitak l'Aseh, he should say "he is lashed and sends it"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah could mean that he cannot exempt himself from lashes by sending it.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> He must send it until it leaves his hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does one send it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> He grabs it by the legs and sends it - "Meshalchei Regel ha'Shor veha'Chamor."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> He grabs it by the wings and sends it. (The wings correspond to legs of an animal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> (Even if one detached its wings and it cannot fly,) it suffices if he sends it so it can walk - "Meshalchei Regel ha'Shor veha'Chamor" (and then he may take it);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> He must send it with its wings (so it can still fly). (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>A man took a bird from its young, plucked its feathers and sent it. Rav Yehudah lashed him, and told him to send it when its feathers grow back.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to which Tana is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is unlike R. Yehudah. He obligates lashes, but exempts from sending it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is unlike Chachamim. They exempt from lashes, but obligate sending it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah holds like Chachamim. He gave lashes mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (a man):</span> What is the law regarding Teimah (a Tahor bird)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Surely, you know that one must send it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (the man):</span> Perhaps it lays only one egg at a time!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Mishnah):</span> One must send the mother even if there is only one egg or chick in the nest.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The man sent it. Rava set a trap and caught it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava should have been concerned lest the man suspect that Rava obligated him to send it for Rava's own gain!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He set the trap far away, so the man would not see.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>ACQUISITION OF THE EGGS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If doves nested in a dovecote or attic, one must send the mother. One may not take, due to Darchei Shalom (to avoid ill will).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina taught that a Chatzer (or attic or any land) acquires for its owner without his knowledge. If so, he owns the eggs, so it is Mezuman. He should be exempt from sending the mother!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The obligation to send the mother begins when the majority of the egg is laid. The Chatzer does not acquire until the egg is in the (airspace of the) Chatzer (i.e. is fully laid);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah obligates sending the mother after the majority is laid, before it is fully laid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Question:</span> If so, why is it forbidden to take the eggs? They are Hefker, like the mother!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Once an egg is mostly laid, the owner (of the Chatzer or attic) expects to get it. Chachamim enacted that others may not take it due to Darchei Shalom. (The mother can fly away, so it is Hefker.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ramban) Question:</span> (Granted, one may not take the mother due to Darchei Shalom.)
