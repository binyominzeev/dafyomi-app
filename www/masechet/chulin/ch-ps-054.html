<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CHECKING A DERUSAH (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> A puncture of any size in the Veshet is Tereifah; the same applies to redness of any size due to venom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Bivi):</span> In the Kaneh, a hole the size of an Isar (a coin) is Tereifah. How much redness is Tereifah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Bivi):</span> Redness of any size is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because the venom burns.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Shmuel bar Marsa):</span> One must check around innards of a Derusah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> I swear that Rav requires from the Kafa until the hip!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which Kafa does he refer?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He refers to the shoulder blade of the foreleg.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he agrees with R. Yitzchak! (There would be no need to swear.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he refers to the base of the brain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> One must check the innards.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Yosef):</span> Rav requires from the Kafa until the hip.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> Who is this 'Rav'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> He learned from Rebbi and R. Chiya! He sat in front of Rebbi, whereas I had to stand. He is great in Torah and piety.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>OTHER TEREIFOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish citing Rav):</span> If in a slaughtered animal the Kaneh was found uprooted, it is Kosher. Had it been uprooted from before Shechitah, the Kaneh could not have been cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One makes another cut in the Kaneh (now, after Shechitah). If it resembles the first cut, we assume that the Kaneh was already uprooted when the first cut (the Shechitah) was done.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This is the rule...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes the seven teachings of the Amora'im (42a).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Certain hunters would kill animals by hitting them on the Gid ha'Nasheh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this make an animal Tereifah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> No. We cannot add to the Tereifos that Chachamim listed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Certain hunters would kill animals by hitting them on the kidney.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this make an animal Tereifah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> No. We cannot add to the Tereifos that Chachamim listed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that the animals die from this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We have a tradition that if a salve was applied, they could live.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WOUNDS THAT DO NOT MAKE AN ANIMAL TEREIFAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following animals are Kosher:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Kaneh was punctured or split.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much can be missing (and it is still Kosher?)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Up to the size of an Isar may be missing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Part of the skull is lacking, but the membrane is intact;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The heart was punctured, but the hole does not reach an inner chamber;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The backbone was broken, but the spinal cord was not cut;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The liver was removed, but a k'Zayis remains;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>The wall between the Masas and Beis ha'Kosos (intermediate stomachs) was punctured;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>The spleen or kidneys were removed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>The lower jaw was removed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>The lung dried by natural causes;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Meir says, if the skin was removed, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chachamim say, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yochanan):</span> The Reisha (42a), which says 'these make an animal Tereifah' is precise. (Nothing is omitted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The Seifa (our Mishnah), which says 'an animal with any of these defects is Kosher' is precise.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>They argue about Rav Masna's law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Masna):</span> If the hip bone was dislocated, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to R. Yochanan, 'this is the rule' (in the Reisha) includes cases similar to the Mishnah, which are also Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">54b----------------------------------------54b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Tana was afraid lest people think that Rav Masna's case is also included (since dislocation is like something missing). Therefore, he taught 'these are Tereifos', to exclude Rav Masna's case.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>According to Reish Lakish, 'this is the rule' (in the Reisha) includes similar cases, which are also Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Tana saw that Rav Masna's case, even though it is Tereifah, is not included (since dislocation is not a puncture, cut, or missing). Therefore, he taught (in the Seifa) 'these are Kosher', to exclude Rav Masna's case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Masna):</span> If the hip bone was dislocated, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is Kosher, but if the attached sinew is cut, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The law is, even if the sinew is cut it is Kosher, unless it is corroded.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>A PART MISSING IN THE KANEH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> How much can be missing...?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> The Isar is the same size like the Dinar of Kordina'ah, and like small Peshiti (coins) of Pumbadisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Chana (a moneychanger) related that Bar Nafcha (R. Yochanan) wanted to see the Kordina'ah Dinar. Bar Nafcha did not let R. Chana stand up for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Bar Nafcha:</span> Workers may not (stop working to) stand for Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> (When people come bearing Bikurim), all workers stand for them, greet them and bless them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Yes, workers stand for people bearing Bikurim, but they don't stand for Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Avin):</span> This shows how great is a Mitzvah in its time. We honor one engaged in a Mitzvah more than we honor Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps letter of the law, we do not. This was a special enactment regarding Bikurim, lest people not bother to bring Bikurim again (because they received no encouragement).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>DOES 'UNTIL' MEAN 'INCLUDING'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> When Chachamim required (the size of) a Sela (Rashi - a skull missing a Sela is Tereifah; R. Tam - if all the skin was removed but a Sela remains, it is Kosher; Tosfos - if there is a hole the size of a Sela in the outer Keres, it is Tereifah), exactly a Sela is like more than a Sela;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Our Mishnah is Machshir a hole in the Kaneh 'until the size of an Isar.' Exactly an Isar is like more than an Isar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Rav Nachman holds that the word 'Ad (until)' connotes 'until but not including'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If a rope sticks out of a bed, until five Tefachim, it is Tahor (i.e. if it becomes Tamei, the bed does not become Tamei with it. This is because it is too short to be useful.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means until and including five!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means until but not including five.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> From five Tefachim until 10, it is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means until and including 10 Tefachim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means until but not including 10.</p></div>
