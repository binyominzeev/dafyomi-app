<p class="dedicationbox">CHULIN 31-43 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SHECHITAH FOR IDOL-WORSHIP</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughters to serve mountains, hills, seas, rivers or the wilderness, the Shechitah is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If two people slaughter together, and one intends to serve one of these things, and the other intends for proper Shechitah, the Shechitah is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The Shechitah is only invalid, but it is not Takroves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If one slaughters to serve mountains, hills, seas, rivers, the wilderness, the sun, moon, stars, constellations, Micha'el (the great ministering angel), or the angel that oversees a worm, this is Takroves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Our Mishnah discusses Shechitah to serve the mountain (or sea...) itself. The Beraisa discusses Shechitah to serve its overseeing angel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> Presumably, all cases of the Beraisa resemble Micha'el, i.e. an angel.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>FORBIDDING ANOTHER'S PROPERTY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If Shimon's animal was crouched in front of an idol, once Reuven slaughters one Siman, he forbids it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is like Ula;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Even though Reuven cannot forbid Shimon's cow through bowing to it, if he did an action to it, he forbids it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman - Beraisa):</span> If one slaughters a Chatas outside the Mikdash, for idolatry, on Shabbos (all b'Shogeg), he brings three Chata'os to atone for this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the animal were forbidden after slaughtering one Siman, he would be exempt for Shechutei Chutz (slaughtering a Korban outside the Mikdash), for cutting the second Siman would be like cutting earth (since the animal is already forbidden. Shechutei Chutz applies only to Kosher Korbanos!)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">40b----------------------------------------40b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> The Beraisa discusses Chatas ha'Of. Since one needs to cut only one Siman, the liabilities come simultaneously (when the Siman is cut).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Huna holds like Ula, who says that even a small action forbids the animal (i.e. once a fragment of the Siman is cut)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the case is, he said that he does not intend to serve idolatry until he completes the Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why does the Beraisa discuss a Chatas? The same applies to any Korban!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mar Zutra):</span> The Beraisa discusses Chatas ha'Of in which exactly half of the Kaneh was already cut. The moment he adds to this cut, the Shechitah is completed, so the liabilities come simultaneously.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Had Rav Huna not said that the animal is forbidden once one Siman is cut, we could not have challenged him from the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He could say like Ula, that a (major) action (i.e. complete Shechitah) to another's animal forbids it. (Since the animal is permitted until the Shechitah is completed, he is liable (also) for Shechutei Chutz.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Had Rav Huna not said that one can forbid another's animal through an action, we could not have challenged him from the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He could say that one cannot forbid a Chatas, for it is not considered his animal (the meat goes to the Kohanim. Since his Shechitah for idolatry does not forbid the animal, he is liable for Shechutei Chutz.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious. What is Rav Papa's Chidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since one gets atonement from a Chatas, it is considered his animal. He teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman, Rav Amram, R. Yitzchak):</span> One cannot forbid another person's property (Rashi - even through a major action).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Beraisa):</span> If one slaughtered a Chatas outside the Mikdash, for idolatry, on Shabbos, he brings three Chata'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We established that this discusses Chatas ha'Of in which exactly half of the Kaneh was already cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He is liable for all three only in this case, because the liabilities come simultaneously. Regarding an animal Korban, he would be exempt for Shechutei Chutz (because the animal becomes forbidden in mid-Shechitah, even though he does not really own his Korban)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If one could not forbid property that is not his, we could establish the Beraisa to discuss even Chatas Behemah, since he cannot forbid it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since one gets atonement from a Chatas, it is considered his, so he can forbid it.</p></div>
