<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHAT IS ABSORBED DURING SALTING?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rava cite Shmuel's law to show that they are forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Salting is like roasting (regarding absorptions and emissions). Pickling is like cooking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Shmuel's law applies only to blood. The Beraisa teaches that it applies to even to brine and soup.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Beraisa):</span> If a Tahor fish was salted with a Tamei fish, it (the Tahor fish) is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Both were salted (and the Tahor fish does not absorb brine of the Tamei fish)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, only the Tahor fish was salted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If the Tahor fish was salted and the Tamei fish was unsalted, it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> In the Reisha, both were salted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Seifa explains the Reisha;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If a Tahor fish was salted with a Tamei fish, it is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The case is, the Tahor fish was salted and the Tamei fish was unsalted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> We must explain this way. If the Reisha permits when both are salted, we already know to permit when only the Tahor fish is salted! (The Seifa would be superfluous)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. (Perhaps) the Seifa must teach when only the Tahor fish is salted, so we will know that the Reisha is not this case;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rather, in the Reisha both are salted, and it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Seifa):</span> If the Tamei fish was salted and the Tahor fish was unsalted, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If both were salted, it is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, even if both were salted, it is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since in the previous case the Tahor fish was salted and the Tamei fish was unsalted, the Tana taught the next case when the Tamei fish was salted and the Tahor fish was unsalted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PRECAUTIONS AGAINST BLOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Blood leaves the meat only if it is salted very well and rinsed very well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> One must salt it, then rinse it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One must rinse it, salt it, and rinse it again.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They do not argue. Rav Huna discusses when the butcher rinsed the meat (before the buyer took it home), and the Beraisa discusses when he did not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rav Dimi of Neharda'a salted with coarse salt. He would shake it off afterwards.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Mesharshiya):</span> We do not presume that there is blood in the Bnei Me'ayim (innards).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This refers to the entrails, stomachs, small intestines, and end of the large intestine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We salt meat only in a porous Kli.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Rav Sheshes would salt each piece individually.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why wouldn't he salt two at a time?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The blood would separate from one and enter the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also in one piece, the blood separates from one end and goes to the other end!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, one may salt even pieces together (Rashi - they all emit blood at the same time, and do not absorb then. Tosfos - because blood is smooth, they do not absorb it. Alternatively, as long as any piece emits blood, all the pieces emit brine, and do not absorb then.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a butcher breaks the neckbone (after slaughtering) before the animal dies, he makes the flesh heavy, steals from the buyer, and causes blood to be absorbed in the limbs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Does it mean that he makes the flesh heavy and steals from the buyer, because he makes blood be absorbed in the limbs?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>His only transgression is theft (he causes people to pay for blood), but he does not cause people to eat blood (salting will remove the blood);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If so, a butcher may do this if he will not sell the meat, rather, eat it himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, does it mean that he makes the flesh heavy and steals from the buyer, and he causes blood be absorbed in the limbs?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Not only does he steal, rather, he also causes people to eat blood (salting will not remove the blood);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If so, he may not do this even to eat it himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH MEAT IS FORBIDDEN WITH MILK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who brings fowl on the same table with cheese does not transgress a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> If he would eat them together, he transgresses a Lav. This shows that the Torah forbids fowl and milk!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. It means that one who brings fowl on the same table with cheese will not come to transgress a Lav (since the Torah does not forbid them).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Basar v'Chalav of Tahor Behemos may not be cooked together. If they were cooked, one may not benefit from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If the meat or milk is from a Tamei Behemah, they may be cooked together, and one may benefit from it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Akiva says, the Torah does not forbid meat of a Chayah or bird (with milk);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says three times "do not cook a kid in its mother's milk," to exclude Chayos, birds and Tamei Behemos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Gelili says, it says "do not eat any Nevelah," and "do not cook a kid in its mother's milk." The Isur of Basar v'Chalav applies to species to which Nevelah applies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since Nevelah applies to birds, Basar v'Chalav should apply to birds!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "In its mother's milk" excludes birds, which do not have milk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this (that all Behemos are forbidden? The Torah said only "Gedi" (kid))?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> "Yehudah sent Gedi ha'Izim (a kid of goats)" implies that when it says only 'Gedi', it may even be a cow or sheep.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">113b----------------------------------------113b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn (Rashi - from a Gezerah Shavah) from here that 'Gedi' always refers to a goat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says also "the skins of Gediyei ha'Izim" implies that (unspecified) 'Gedi' may be a cow or sheep.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn that 'Gedi' always refers to a goat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These are Shnei Kesuvim (two verses, one of which could have been learned from the other). We do not learn from them (to other places).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that learns from Shnei Kesuvim, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are two exclusions. The above verses said "ha'Izim. They could have said 'Izim'.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHICH MEAT AND MILK ARE INCLUDED IN THE ISUR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> From (the repetitions of) "Gedi" we include Chelev, meat of a Nevelah, and a fetus. From "Gedi" we exclude blood, a fetal sac, and meat of a Tamei animal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"In the milk of its mother" excludes the milk of a male (if such an abberation should arise), of a slaughtered animal, and of a Tamei animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Gedi" is written only three times (regarding Basar v'Chalav). How does Shmuel learn six laws from it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> Shmuel holds that Isur Chal Al Isur (an Isur takes effect even on something that is already forbidden). We derive Chelev and meat of a Nevelah from one "Gedi";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We do not need a verse to exclude blood or a fetal sac, for these are not included in "Gedi."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One "Gedi" includes a fetus, and the last "Gedi" excludes meat of a Tamei animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel holds that Ein Isur Chal Al Isur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel citing R. Eliezer):</span> If a Tamei Kohen ate Tamei Terumah, he is not liable to death (at the hands of Heaven);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"They will die for it, when they profane it (Terumah)" excludes Tamei Terumah, which is already profaned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> In general, Shmuel holds that Isur Chal Al Isur. Tamei Terumah is an exception, because it says "in it."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> In general, Shmuel holds that Ein Isur Chal Al Isur; Basar v'Chalav is an exception. We learn this from "Gedi."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Shmuel himself holds that Isur Chal Al Isur. He cited R. Eliezer's opinion, but argues with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achdevoy bar Ami):</span> If one cooked (meat) in milk of an animal that never nursed (calves) yet, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Shmuel excluded milk of a male. This is because a male will never be a mother;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A female will (probably) become a mother. Her milk is forbidden (with meat) even though she has not nursed yet.</p></div>
