<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TREIFOS OF THE SPINAL CORD (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Does 'until' include (the first area between the branches)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If it does not include it, what is the law at the first branching?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If it does include it, what is the law if the cord is cut in the branches at the first branching?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> A cut at the branching is like a cut in the flesh (the animal is Kosher).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to a cut at the first or second branching.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it refers to a cut at the third branching.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> The spinal cord of a bird extends until below the wings. (If the majority is cut, it is Tereifah);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> It extends until between the wings.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Ben Pazi was checking a bird. He checked until between the wings, and he was called to the Nasi's house. He went.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Ula:</span> I don't know if he holds like Reish Lakish, that no more needs to be checked, or if he stopped in the middle out of respect for the Nasi.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A REMOVED LIVER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the liver was removed...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If anything remains, even less than k'Zayis (the volume of an olive), it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If k'Zayis of the liver remains, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> One Mishnah is like R. Chiya, and the other is like R. Shimon bar Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> R. Chiya would throw out an animal if less than k'Zayis of the liver remained. R. Shimon bar Rebbi would eat it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> R. Chiya would not eat liver. (He did not consider it to be such a vital organ). R. Shimon bar Rebbi would eat it. (Since it is a crucial organ, it is healthy to eat. 	Presumably, R. Shimon holds that if a tiny amount of the liver remains, it cannot heal, so it is Tereifah). (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A way to remember the opinions is that rich people (i.e. the son of the Nasi) economize.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> A k'Zayis of the liver must remain in the area of the gall bladder.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> A k'Zayis must remain in the place from which the liver is suspended.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> We are concerned for both opinions. A k'Zayis must remain in each place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If the k'Zayis is not all in one place, what is the law? If it is stretched out in a strip, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If it is like a thin sheet, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>These questions are unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zerika):</span> If the liver is uprooted in several places, but still clings to the surrounding Chelev, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> Since the entire liver is intact, it is Kosher according to both opinions (R. Zeira and Rav Ada bar Ahavah above).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>PROBLEMS IN THE LUNGS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A punctured lung...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav, Shmuel and Rav Asi):</span> If the outer membrane is punctured, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> If the inner membrane is punctured, it is Tereifah. (The text connotes that this is according to Rav, Shmuel and Rav Asi. However, the Maharam derives that Tosfos holds that Version #2 is only according to Shmuel (and perhaps Rav Asi).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef bar Minyomi):</span> A Siman to remember this is a rose-colored garment that holds the lungs. (He holds like Version #2.).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If only the outer membrane is punctured, surely the lower one protects (so the animal is not Tereifah), like Rava taught;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If the outer membrane of the lung was peeled off but the red inner membrane remains, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If only the inner membrane was punctured, does the outer one protect?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Acha and Ravina argued. One said that it protects, and the other said that it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Halachah is, it protects, like Rav Yosef taught.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If when one blows into the lungs it sounds as if air is escaping, he must check it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he knows from where the sound comes, he puts a feather, piece of straw or some spit there. If there really is a hole, it will move when he blows.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If he does not know from where the sound comes, he puts the lungs in a basin of lukewarm water and blows into the lungs.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One may not use hot water. This would constrict the hole.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>One may not use cold water. This could cause the outer membrane to tear.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>If he sees bubbles, there is a hole, so it is Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If there are no bubbles, the noise was due to a tear in the inner membrane alone. It is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If the outer membrane of the lung was peeled off but the red inner membrane remains, it is Kosher. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If part of the lung turned red, it is Kosher. If all of it turned red, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Ravina):</span> You say that if only part turns red it is Kosher, because it can get better;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Also if the entire lung turns red, it can get better!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one wounds a Sheretz (except for the eight Sheratzim listed in the Torah) on Shabbos he is exempt unless blood comes out, even if the blood is recognizable in the skin. (This shows that redness does not indicate a puncture.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Rava learns from the eight Sheratzim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one wounds one of the eight Sheratzim on Shabbos he is liable if the blood is recognizable in the skin, even if it did not come out.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, even a redness in part of the lungs should be Tereifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Rather, it is the same whether part or all is red. (Rashi - it is Kosher. Tosfos - it is Tereifah. On 47b, we say that red is Kosher. We must say that this is when it whitens when inflated. Rosh - some distinguish different shades of red.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a lung partially dried up, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much must it dry up?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It is so dry that it can be crushed with a fingernail.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like R. Yosi ben ha'Meshulam.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A dried ear is a blemish if it would not bleed when punctured;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yosi ben ha'Meshulam says, it is a blemish if it can be crushed with a fingernail.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is even like Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The ear is exposed to wind, therefore it will not heal. The lung can heal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If the lung has black or colored crusts, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> If a punctured blister is found in the lung, we do not compare it to a fresh blister (to determine whether it was there from before the Shechitah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a scab is found between two non-adjacent chambers of the lungs, it does not help to check. (Even if no puncture is found, the animal is Tereifah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is between two adjacent chambers, it will heal, it is Kosher.</p></div>
