<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why can't we put the flank on top?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When handling the flank, the butcher breaks the membrane.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> A Chacham must train himself to do three things: signing his name, Shechitah and circumcision.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chananya citing Rav):</span> He must also know to make the knot of Tefilin, the blessing of Chasanim, and Tzitzis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Yehudah held that these are common, so a Chacham need not train himself to learn them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Any butcher who does not know the laws of Shechitah, one may not eat from his Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The laws (things which disqualify Shechitah) are: pausing; chopping the Simanim (not in a back and forth motion); inserting the knife between the Simanim and cutting; not completing the Shechitah in the ring of the windpipe in the Shechitah began; and uprooting one of the Simanim from its place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his Chidush? All of these are explicit in the Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even if we have seen the butcher slaughter nicely two or three times, we may not rely on his Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since he does not know the laws, perhaps he paused or chopped without realizing.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CHECKING AFTER SHECHITAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The butcher must check the Simanim after Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Yosef - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If he paused the time needed for checking....</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is the time for checking the Simanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> No, it is the time for the Chacham (of the city) to check the knife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This time varies (depending how far away the Chacham is)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, it is the time for the butcher himself to check the knife (when he is the Chacham).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Simanim were not checked, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar ben Antigonus):</span> It is like a Tereifah, and one may not eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> It is like a Neveilah, and it is Metamei one who moves it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The two opinions argue about Rav Huna's law;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> An animal is forbidden (to eat) when it is alive. After death, we assume that it is still forbidden unless we know that it was slaughtered properly;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If we know that it was slaughtered, we assume that it is permitted, unless we know what made it a Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa holds that we assume that it is still forbidden (it was not slaughtered properly), i.e. a Neveilah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Elazar ben Antigonus holds that we know that it was forbidden to eat, so we assume it is still forbidden to eat; but we have no source to say that it is Metamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> An animal is forbidden when it is alive. After death, we assume that it is still forbidden unless we know that it was slaughtered properly;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>If we know that it was slaughtered, we assume that it is permitted, unless we know what made it a Tereifah</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav Huna simply say 'if it was slaughtered, it is permitted (unless...)'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that even if we have grounds to suspect that it was a Tereifah, we assume that it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba):</span> If a wolf took the innards of a slaughtered animal, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If they are not here, what is the question?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather - if it punctured the innards of a slaughtered animal, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If we know that it punctured them, what is the question?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if it took the innards of a slaughtered animal, and returned them punctured, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Are we concerned that there was already a hole where the wolf bit?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> We are not concerned.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ARE WE MORE STRINGENT ABOUT PHYSICAL DANGERS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one saw a bird pecking at a fig, or a mouse making holes in a watermelon, we are concerned lest there was already a hole there (from a snake), and the food may not be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> You cannot ask from there. We are more stringent about danger than about prohibitions!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is the difference? In both cases, we are stringent about a Safek!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We are not equally stringent!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We are lenient about a Safek of Tum'ah in Reshus ha'Rabim (a public domain). We are stringent about a Safek case of exposed water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Tum'ah in a Reshus ha'Rabim is an exception. It is a tradition from Moshe from Sinai, to learn from Sotah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Sotah, we are stringent about a Safek only in a Reshus ha'Yachid (i.e. seclusion). Also for Tum'ah, we are stringent about a Safek only in a Reshus ha'Yachid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - Rav Simi - Mishnah):</span> If a weasel was walking among loaves of Terumah, holding a dead rodent in its mouth, and we are unsure whether the rodent touched the loaves, we say that the loaves are Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In a Safek case of exposed water, we are stringent!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also the case of the weasel is an exception. A tradition from Sinai teaches that we learn from Sotah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We are stringent about Sotah, which is a case in which the party that became Safek Tamei (defiled, i.e. the woman) has understanding to answer questions. Also regarding Tum'ah, we are stringent only in such cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - Rav Ashi - Beraisa):</span> If a flask (with water to be sanctified with ashes of the red heifer) was left open and was found covered, it is Tamei. We assume that a Tamei person covered it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was left covered and was found open, the water may not be sanctified with ashes of the red heifer if dew descended at night, or if a weasel can drink from it (i.e. it is not hanging in the air);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>According to R. Gamliel, we are concerned even if a snake can drink from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> In the Reisha we are concerned for people. In the Seifa we are concerned for rodents, because it is the way of rodents to expose things, but not to cover them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Regarding exposed water, we are concerned lest a snake drank from it (even if it was exposed from the beginning, and there is no evidence that anything happened at all)!</p></div>
