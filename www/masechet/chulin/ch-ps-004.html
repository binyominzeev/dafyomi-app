<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE SHECHITAH OF A KUSI (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> Similarly, if one finds a string of birds slaughtered by a Kusi, he cuts the head of one and gives to the Kusi a k'Zayis of the meat. If he eats it, the birds are permitted. If not, they are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Abaye leaned from the Reisha of the Beraisa. Rava learned from the Seifa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Abaye deduced that the Reisha permits him to slaughter only if a Yisrael stands over him, but not if the Yisrael goes in and out.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rava deduced that the Seifa forbids the animal (if the Kusi will not eat from it) only because the Kusi slaughtered on his own, but if a Yisrael goes in and out, he would be allowed to slaughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa opposes Abaye!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that if a Yisrael goes in and out, this is like an unsupervised Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha opposes Rava!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that if a Yisrael goes in and out, this is like a supervised Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Similarly, if one finds a string of birds slaughtered by a Kusi, he cuts the head of one and gives the Kusi a k'Zayis of the meat. If he eats it, the birds are permitted. If not, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps only the bird that he ate from was slaughtered properly!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Menasheh):</span> The Yisrael put all the birds under his cloak and took out one, so the Kusi does not know which bird he took.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Kusi had a sign which bird was slaughtered properly!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> The Yisrael mashed and diced it, so the sign would not be noticed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Kusi ate it because he believes that the Torah does not require Shechitah of birds! (Only Shechitah of animals is explicit in the Torah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Pausing, pressing, Chaladah, Hagramah (if the Shechitah traverses different rings of the Kaneh (windpipe)) or Ikor (uprooting the Kaneh or Veshet (foodpipe)) disqualify Shechitah. These are not explicit in the Torah (yet we trust Kusim to slaughter animals properly)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that since they are Muchzakim (established) to be careful about these things, we may rely on them;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Similarly, since Kusim are Muchzakim to slaughter birds properly, we may rely on them.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>FOR WHICH MITZVOS ARE KUSIM BELIEVED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Tana'im argue about whether we may rely on Kusim for a Mitzvah that they are Muchzakim in, but the Mitzvah is not written in the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Matzah of Kusim is permitted. One who eats it on the first night of Pesach fulfills the Mitzvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer forbids it, because they are not careful about the details of Mitzvos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, every Mitzvah that the Kusim are Muchzakim in, they keep it more meticulously than Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, if their Matzah is permitted, one who eats it fulfills the Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that they are not careful to guard the Matzah Lishmah (with intent for the Mitzvah). The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Eliezer forbids it, for they are not careful about the details of Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that they are not careful to guard Matzah (from becoming Chametz).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, every Mitzvah the Kusim are Muchzakim in, they keep it more meticulously than Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also the first Tana says that one may rely on their Matzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about Mitzvos written in the Torah in which they are not Muchzakim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana holds that one may rely on them for any Mitzvah written in the Torah, even if they are not Muchzakim in it. R. Shimon ben Gamliel holds that one may rely on them only if they are Muchzakim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, why does R. Shimon say 'every Mitzvah in which they are Muchzakim'? (This implies that he includes more than the first Tana.) He should say, 'if they are Muchzakim in it'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, they argue about Mitzvos not written in the Torah in which they are Muchzakim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana holds that one may not rely on them, since they are not written in the Torah, even though they are Muchzakim. R. Shimon ben Gamliel holds that since they are Muchzakim, one may rely on them.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WANTON SINNERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a Yisrael Mumar eats Neveilos for pleasure:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one checks a knife, one may let the Mumar slaughter with it. One may eat the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he trusted to Shochet properly?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he can (slaughter properly, and) eat permitted food, he will not (slaughter improperly, and) eat Isur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why can't we rely on him to check the knife himself?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If his knife is Pasul, he will not exert himself (to get a proper knife).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Beraisa supports Rava.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven (transgresses and) keeps Chametz during Pesach, immediately after Pesach, others may benefit from his Chametz, because he trades (his Chametz with that of Nochrim).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Yehudah, who holds that if a Yisrael keeps Chametz during Pesach, it is forbidden mid'Oraisa after Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The Beraisa is like R. Shimon, who forbids only mid'Rabanan after Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We are lenient to assume that a Mumar minimizes his sins only regarding (what could be for us) an Isur mid'Rabanan, but not for a Torah Isur (such as Shechitah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection of rejection:</span> Even if the Beraisa is like R. Shimon, it supports Rava!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It does not say 'we assume that he trades', rather 'he trades', i.e. definitely!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a Mumar avoids even Isurim mid'Rabanan, all the more so, he avoids Torah Isurim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Also the following supports Rava.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Anyone may slaughter, even a Kusi, Arel (uncircumcised man), even a Mumar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of an Arel?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If (two or three of) his brothers died through circumcision (Tosfos - when they were adults, or after their blood was properly absorbed in the flesh), he is a fully Kosher Yisrael! (He should never circumcise himself.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he rejects the Mitzvah of circumcision.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Tana holds that one who rejects one Mitzvah is not like one who rejects the entire Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa says, 'even a Yisrael Mumar.' What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he is a Mumar to a Mitzvah other than Neveilah, this is the same as Mumar to circumcision, which was already taught!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he is a Mumar to eat Neveilah, and it says that he may slaughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Really, a Mumar to eat Neveilah cannot be trusted, for he considers it to be permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, the Seifa discusses a Mumar to idolatry. It supports Rav Anan;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Anan):</span> If a Mumar to idolatry slaughters, the animal is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE SHECHITAH OF A MUMAR IDOLATER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav Anan learns from Yehoshafat (who was a Tzadik). He ate from the Shechitah of Achav's entourage, who were Mumrim to idolatry - "Achav slaughtered flock and cattle in abundance, for Yehoshafat and the people with him, and he enticed him to ascend to Remos Gilad."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Yehoshafat did not eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He enticed him" (with what he slaughtered).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he enticed him with words!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Enticement is not through words.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "if your brother will entice you"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That means through food and drink.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "(Hash-m) was enticed"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is different. Hash-m does not eat, so it must mean with words.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Yehoshafat drank, but did not eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he drank Achav's wine, he must hold that a Mumar to idolatry is not like a Mumar to the entire Torah. For the same reason, he may eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. really, a Mumar to idolatry is like a Mumar to the entire Torah. (He is considered like a Nochri.) Chachamim had not yet decreed against wine of Nochrim. (However, the Torah forbids Shechitah of a Nochri.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Kings do not normally drink without eating.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "He slaughtered... and enticed him" - he enticed him through Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Ovadyah (a Tzadik in Achav's entourage) slaughtered the animals!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He could not slaughter all of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the 7000 righteous men slaughtered them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"I left in Yisrael 7000 men, the knees that did not bow to the (idol) Ba'al".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were hiding from Izevel (Achav's wife).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Achav's men were righteous!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This cannot be. "A ruler who heeds falsity, all his servants are wicked"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Yehoshafat's men were not Tzadikim, and they ate from the Shechitah of Achav's men, and Yehoshafat ate only from what Ovadyah slaughtered!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since "a ruler who heeds falsity, all his servants are wicked", we infer that a ruler who heeds truth, all his servants are Tzadikim.</p></div>
