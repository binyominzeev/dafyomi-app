<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TRIEFOS OF THE LEGS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The legs were cut...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Birds with cut legs were brought before Rava. He checked that the sinews were intact at the juncture of the sinews, and ruled that they are Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> If the foreleg of an animal became detached, it is Kosher; regarding a bird, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If the wings of a bird became detached, it is Tereifah. We are concerned lest the lung was punctured.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel and R. Yochanan):</span> We check the lungs. If they were not punctured, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> Birds don't have lungs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> They have lungs. They are the size of a rose leaf. They are between the wings.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Chizkiyah mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He cannot mean that birds don't have lungs at all. We see that they do!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, they have lungs, but defects in the lungs do not make a bird Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Levi taught that any defect that is Tereifah in an animal is Tereifah in a bird (including punctured lungs!);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the skull is broken and the membrane is intact, this is Tereifah only in birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> A bird does not become Tereifah through an injury to the lungs due to falling or being burned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan countered 'they have lungs. They are the size of a rose leaf. They are between the wings.' This implies that Chizkiyah holds that they have no lungs at all!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> Indeed, he meant that they have no lungs at all. Chizkiyah was not familiar with birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> If the leg of a bird became detached, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> Chachamim of Pumbadisa say that Rav Yehudah cites Rav to say that it is Tereifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> Different areas hold differently. (In Pumbadisa, they hold that this is Tereifah, therefore Rav did not want to permit this in front of them. Rav Yehudah mistakenly deduced that Rav himself holds that it is Tereifah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Yirmeyah bar Aba was checking the juncture of the sinews of birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> Why do you bother? Rav Huna cited Rav to say that if the leg of a bird became detached, it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah:</span> A Mishnah teaches that if an animal's (hind) leg was cut below the knee, it is Kosher. If it was cut above the knee, or if the juncture of the sinews was removed, it is Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rav said that the same applies to birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> This contradicts what Rav Huna said in Rav's name!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yirmeyah had no answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> Perhaps cutting is Tereifah, but not if it was detached.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah:</span> Rav explicitly said this!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We sometimes find that cutting in one place makes an animal Tereifah, but cutting away more does not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira citing Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> If the leg of a bird became detached, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> After you came to Eretz Yisrael, we explicitly heard Rav Huna cite Rav to say that it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">57b----------------------------------------57b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Also, when I debated with R. Yirmeyah, he ultimately agreed that Rav explicitly was Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>What is your source that it is Tereifah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> R. Chiya bar Aba cited Rav to say that it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Idi citing R. Yochanan):</span> It is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Idi):</span> Had R. Yochanan been present when Rebbi and R. Chanina permitted this, he would not have shown any trace of dissent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina citing Rebbi):</span> If a bird's leg became detached, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Chanina had such a bird, and Rebbi permitted it. R. Chanina preserved it and was constantly showing it to Talmidim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>The Halachah does not follow these lenient opinions. rather it is like R. Yehoshua ben Levi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi ben Nehurai):</span> What size hole in the Kaneh is Tereifah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Levi - Mishnah):</span> The size of an Italian Isar is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi):</span> There was a sheep that had a hole in its Kaneh. They sealed it, and it healed!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> This is no proof! The Halachah is established throughout Yisrael that a detached leg is Tereifah, yet the leg of R. Shimon ben Chalifta's chicken came off, and they covered it with a reed, and it healed!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that even though it healed, the chicken did not live a year;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also the sheep did not survive a year!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DEFECTS THAT IMPROVED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Chalifta tried to get R. Yehudah to retract his opinion that a bird missing the small feathers is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon had a chicken whose small feathers had fallen out. He put it in an oven and put a garment over it. It grew more feathers than it had initially.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps R. Yehudah holds that a Tereifah sometimes shows signs of improvement!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It will not show improvement regarding the defect that is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Chalifta sought to verify "lazy one, observe the ant and grow wise. It has no ruler or king";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In summer, he made shade over an anthill. An ant came out. R. Shimon made a mark on the ant. It went back to inform the other ants of the shade. (Ants enjoy shade.) R. Shimon removed the shade.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The other ants came out, and the sun beat upon them. They killed the marked ant.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> This shows that they have no king. If they had a king, they would not do this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Objections (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Perhaps the king was with them when they killed it! Or, perhaps they were fulfilling the king's decree (to kill liars)! Or, perhaps the previous king died, and they had not yet appointed the next king!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We know that they have no king only from the verse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If an injured animal survives 12 months, this shows that it was not Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A sign of Tereifos is that the animal cannot bear children;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if it improves, it is Kosher. If it gets worse, it is Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi says, if it lives 30 days, this shows that it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Many Tereifos survive two or three years!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna holds like the following Tana (R. Shimon ben Elazar);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If there is a long hole in the skull, or many small holes that add up to the area of a drill (it is Tereifah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi ben ha'Meshulam says, a case occurred in which a man's skull was pierced. They covered over it with a gourd, and he lived.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Elazar:</span> That is no proof (that this is not a Tereifah). He was hurt in summer, and he died that winter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> The Halachah is, a Tereifah can give birth, and it can improve.</p></div>
