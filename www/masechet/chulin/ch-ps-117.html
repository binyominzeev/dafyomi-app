<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ME'ILAH APPLIES TO CHELEV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are stringencies of Chelev over blood, and stringencies of blood over Chelev:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Stringencies of Chelev are that Me'ilah applies to Chelev, and one is liable for eating Chelev that is Pigul, Nosar or Tamei (in addition to liability for Chelev);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>These do not apply to blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Stringencies of blood are that blood of Behemos, Chayos and birds is forbidden, whether they are Teme'im or Tehorim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is not true regarding Chelev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source (that Me'ilah applies to Chelev)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yanai):</span> "Ka'asher Yuram mi'Shor Zevach Shelamim" (the same parts of a Shelamim offered on the Mizbe'ach (the Emurim) are offered from Par Kohen Mashi'ach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Torah equate them? The parts offered from the Par are explicitly written!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Par teaches about Shelamim. Just like Me'ilah applies to the Par (it is Kodshei Kodashim), it applies also to (Emurim of) a Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanina) Question:</span> Why don't you learn like Rebbi?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> "Kol Chelev la'Shem" includes Emurim (the parts offered on the Mizbe'ach) of Kodshei Kalim, that Me'ilah applies to them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Torah must write both verses;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it said only "Kol Chelev," we would not know that Me'ilah applies to Emurim that are not called Chelev, i.e. the kidneys and Yoseres ha'Kaved;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it said only "Ka'asher Yuram," we would not know that Me'ilah applies to a sheep's tail, since a bull's tail is not offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mari):</span> If a sheep's tail is called Chelev, it should be forbidden to eat (even in a Chulin animal)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zvid):</span> The Torah forbids "All Chelev of an ox, sheep or goat," only Chelev that is common to all three animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The tail is not called (plain) Chelev, only "Chelbo ha'Alyah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, Me'ilah should not apply to it! (The source was "Kol Chelev.")</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must answer like Answer #1.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ME'ILAH DOES NOT APPLY TO BLOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Me'ilah does not apply to blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> Chelev is "Lachem" - it is considered yours (and not of Hekdesh. Therefore there is no Me'ilah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> It is "to atone", and not to transgress Me'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> "It" - it has the same law before and after atonement.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like there is no Me'ilah after atonement (its Mitzvah was done), also before.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps just like there is Me'ilah before atonement (its Mitzvah was not yet done), also after?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Me'ilah never applies to something after its Mitzvah was done.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Me'ilah applies to ashes taken off the Mizbe'ach, after the Mitzvah was done - "you will put it by the Mizbe'ach (and you may not use it)"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Taking the ashes and the garments the Kohen Gadol wears on Yom Kipur are Shnei Kesuvim (both teach that Me'ilah applies after the Mitzvah was done). We do not learn from them to other places.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like Chachamim, who expound "he will leave them there" - his garments must be buried.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Dosa, who forbids a Kohen Gadol to use them again on Yom Kipur (but permits a regular Kohen to use them), how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Taking the ashes and Eglah Arufah are Shnei Kesuvim. We do not learn to other places.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that we do not learn from Shnei Kesuvim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to the opinion that we learn from Shnei Kesuvim, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">117b----------------------------------------117b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding each of these, the verse teaches that (only) here (but not in other places) Me'ilah applies after the Mitzvah was done;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding taking the ashes it says "he will put it";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding Eglah Arufah it says "ha'Arufah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Three verses (above, (c), (d) and (e)) exclude blood from Me'ilah. Why are three needed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They exempt blood from liability for Nosar, Me'ilah, and Tum'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>No verse is needed to exclude Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Pigul applies to anything that has Matirim (something else permits it to people or to the Mizbe'ach);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since blood permits (itself, meat and Emurim), Pigul does not apply to it.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SHOMRIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following can join with meat to comprise k'Beitzah (the volume of an egg) for Tum'as Ochlim, but do not join to comprise k'Zayis Tum'as Nevelah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Skin, Rotev (congealed juice of the meat), spices cooked with the meat, Alal (this will be explained), bones, sinews, horns, and hooves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Similarly, if a Yisrael slaughtered a Tamei animal for a Nochri, and it is still quivering, it receives Tum'as Ochlim, but not Tum'as Nevelah until it dies or its head is cut off;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tum'as Ochlim is more inclusive than Tum'as Nevelah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if a k'Zayis of Alal gathered in one place (and one touched it and entered the Mikdash or ate Kodshim), he is liable for it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Our Mishnah teaches like the following Beraisa. (A Shomer is something attached to food that preserves it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Shomer is considered like the food it preserves only regarding light Tum'ah (i.e. of food; it joins to comprise k'Beitzah), but not for severe Tum'ah (Nevelah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the law of Shomer applies to light Tum'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> (Hechsher is when water falls) "on any Zera Zeru'a (seed that is planted)". This discusses the way people plant, in which the wheat, barley or lentils are still in their shells.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Shomer does not apply to severe Tum'ah?</p></div>
