<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yochanan holds like Abaye;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> Here, R. Meir holds that if one holds the smaller food and the larger one will break off, they are considered like one;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If (a food of) Terumah was cut and it is barely attached:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If one picks up the smaller piece and the larger piece comes with it, they are considered like one. (If a Tevul Yom touches either, both are disqualified);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If not, they are like two pieces. (Perhaps R. Yochanan infers this. It is not in our text of the Mishnah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Muchlefes ha'Shitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> (This means that regarding Tevul Yom, R. Meir deviates from what he normally holds, that they are like one in either case!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this is not a deviation. R. Meir holds that Tevul Yom is more lenient than other Tum'os!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos Yom Tov):</span> (Muchlefes ha'Shitah means that we must switch the opinions of R. Meir and R. Yehudah in this Mishnah (Tevul Yom 3:1); R. Meir considers them like one as long as the smaller piece comes with the larger piece (even if the larger does not come with the smaller). Our text in the Mishnayos is like R. Yochanan's revision.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must he switch the opinions? Perhaps R. Meir is lenient only regarding Tevul Yom, but in general, they are like one in either case! (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (He cannot say this, because a Beraisa equates them!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> The law is the same regarding Tevul Yom and all other Tum'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Rebbi does not distinguish between Tum'os, but R. Meir does!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Oshaya):</span> R. Yochanan meant that according to Rebbi, Muchlefes ha'Shitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 4:b, 127b - Rava):</span> R. Meir holds that a Yad for Tum'ah is also a Yad for Hechsher. R. Shimon holds that it is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, it was slaughtered before the owner intended to feed it to Nochrim. R. Meir holds that it becomes Huchshar anyway. R. Shimon holds that it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah citing R. Akiva):</span> Chelev of a slaughtered animal receives Tum'as Ochlim if one intended to feed it to a Nochri. It was already Huchshar through Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> You taught to us that if one gathered and rinsed endives, with intent to feed them to animals, and then decided to feed them to people, they are not Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim until they get a second Hechsher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Akiva agreed to R. Yehudah. They need Hechsher after intent.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Meir holds like R. Akiva taught initially. R. Shimon holds like his retraction.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> The case is, some blood spurted on the dangling limb at the beginning of Shechitah. It was wiped off before the second Siman was slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir holds that Shechitah starts with the initial incision (in a Siman) and continues until the end (cutting the majority of the second Siman). The blood that spurted was blood of Shechitah, so it is Machshir the limb;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon holds that Shechitah is instantaneous. (Everything until Shechitah is completed is mere preparation for Shechitah.) The blood that spurted was like blood of a wound. It is not Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Rav Ashi):</span> R. Meir holds that blood of Shechitah is Machshir. R. Shimon holds that it is not. The Shechitah is Machshir (only what it permits. The limb remains forbidden, so it is not Huchshar.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a cucumber was planted in a flowerpot (without a hole), and it grew outside the pot, (the part outside nurtures from the ground, and the entire plant nurtures from it, therefore) the entire plant is Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Shimon is Metaher only the part outside the pot.</p></div>
