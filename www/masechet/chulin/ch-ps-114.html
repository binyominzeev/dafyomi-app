<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> The source to forbid eating Basar v'Chalav is "do not eat any abomination." Anything that the Torah forbade doing, one may not eat the result.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Wherever the Torah says "will not be eaten" or "do not eat," this also forbids benefit, unless there is a source to permit benefit, like we find regarding Nevelah.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the Torah meant like R. Meir, it should have said 'to a Ger you will give it... and sell... ';</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir says, "or" teaches that it is better to give it to a Ger than to sell it to a Nochri.</p></div>
