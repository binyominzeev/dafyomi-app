<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav Safra asked Rav Zerika again.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Zerika:</span> Yehudah brei d'R. Shimon ben Pazi served the branch holding the heart, lungs and liver to me and to Yanai brei d'R. Ami; and we ate it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Perhaps the opening of the branch was outside the pot (so the blood flowed out), or the liver had previously been Nichlat (treated so it would not emit blood when cooked)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Huna would put liver in vinegar (to be Cholet it). Rav Nachman would put boiling water over it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The vinegar used becomes forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> If so, also the liver would be forbidden. After it emits, it absorbs!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rav bar Sheva visited Rav Nachman. He was served overcooked liver. He would not eat it. When Rav Nachman heard about this, he commanded that they force him to eat it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Tana'im argue about this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The liver forbids, but does not become forbidden, because it emits (blood), it does not absorb;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yishmael the son of Yochanan ben Brokah says, if liver is seasoned with spices or overcooked, it forbids and becomes forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Rabah bar Rav Huna visited Rabah bar Rav Nachman's house. They served him a large amount of clean bread smeared with oil and honey.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah bar Rav Huna:</span> Did you know that I was coming?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">His hosts:</span> (No,) we prepared for Shabbos - "you will call Shabbos a delight."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rabah noticed blood-vessels (of the liver) that had absorbed blood. He asked why they allowed this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">His hosts:</span> How can we avoid this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> Cut it lengthwise and widthwise, and roast it with the cut side on bottom.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is only for liver. It is not necessary for spleen. (The redness is not blood. It is fat.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Shmuel would have a dish with a (whole) cooked spleen on the day he had a bloodletting.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ROASTING LIVER AND MEAT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> If liver was roasted on the same spit with other meat, and the liver was above, both are permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because blood (that drips from the liver) is slippery. It slides off the meat. It is not absorbed;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If udder was roasted on a spit with other meat, and the udder was above, the meat is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because milk (that excludes from the udder) clings and is absorbed in the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Dimi or Neharda'a):</span> If udder was above other meat (they were roasted on the same spit), both are permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim were lenient because the Isur of milk from a slaughtered cow (cooked with meat) is only mid'Rabanan,</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If liver was above other meat, the meat is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Because the Torah forbids blood, we are stringent. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Mereimar:</span> The laws of udder and liver are the same. L'Chatchilah, they may be roasted under other meat, but not above;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>B'Di'eved, if they were roasted above, all is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rav Ashi visited his father-in-law. He saw his brother-in-law roasting liver above meat on the same spit.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">111b----------------------------------------111b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> How can you be so brazen? Chachamim permitted this only b'Di'eved!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If the dripping fat is collected in a pan underneath, the fat is forbidden, even if the liver is on bottom (because also blood from the liver drips into the pan).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Blood from any meat drips into the pan with the fat. Why is blood from liver different?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Other blood sinks to the bottom and does not mix with the fat. Blood from the liver floats and mixes with the fat.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ABSORBED BLOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A knife used to slaughter may not be used to cut hot meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> If it will be used to cut cold meat, one must rinse it. (Rashi - one must rinse the meat, after it is cut. Others explain that one must rinse the knife, before cutting.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> It may be used to cut cold meat without rinsing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This is like another teaching of Shmuel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Salting (causes absorptions and emissions) like roasting. Pickling is like cooking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> Salting is not like roasting. Pickling is not like cooking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> This is wrong, for R. Ami was a Talmid of R. Yochanan, and he broke a basin used to salt meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely, he heard from R. Yochanan that salting is like roasting (so the basin absorbed blood)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana, brother of Rav Yehudah):</span> One may not put hot food in a basin in which meat was salted. A radish cut with a knife (used for meat) may be eaten with milk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is one forbidden and the other permitted?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The radish absorbed permitted Ta'am, the basin absorbed forbidden Ta'am.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Even though the radish absorbed permitted Ta'am, it becomes forbidden when it mixes with milk!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The radish can be permitted if one tastes it (and does not taste meat in it). The basin cannot be permitted (one may not taste food put in it)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> A Nochri cook can taste it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not cook milk in a pot in which meat was cooked. If milk was cooked in it, if it absorbed the Ta'am of meat, it is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One may not cook Chulin in a pot in which Terumah was cooked. If Chulin was cooked in it, if it absorbed the Ta'am of Terumah. Only a Kohen may eat it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Granted, in the latter case a Kohen can taste whether or not the Terumah can be tasted in the Chulin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding meat and milk, how can we tell if the meat gave Ta'am? One may not taste the milk, for perhaps it is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We may rely on a Nochri cook to taste it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The basin is forbidden when there is no Nochri cook to taste it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ABSORBED TA'AM OF MEAT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If hot fish was put in a (clean) bowl in which meat was eaten, one may not eat the fish with milk;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may eat it with milk. It received only a Ta'am of (meat from the bowl, which received only) a Ta'am (of actual meat)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rav's law was not said explicitly. It was inferred from the following episode.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav visited his grandson Rav Simi bar Chiya. Rav's eyes were hurting him. They made for him an ointment in a pot. Later, food was cooked in the pot, and Rav tasted the ointment. This taught him that Ta'am can be transferred in this way.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is not a source. The ointment was very bitter, therefore its Ta'am was preserved more than the Ta'am of meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Elazar served to Shmuel fish that were put (when still hot) in a bowl used for meat. Shmuel ate them with milk and offered them to R. Elazar. He refused.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> I gave to your Rebbi (Rav, from whom R. Elazar heard that this is forbidden) and he ate. Why won't you eat?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Elazar (to Rav):</span> Did you retract from your teaching (that this is forbidden)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav:</span> Shmuel would never serve me something that I forbid. (I forbid only a very potent taste, like the episode with the ointment - Rashi according to the Ran. Others explain Rashi to say that the episode never occurred. Others say that Shmuel fed it to a different Rebbi of R. Elazar (Ritva), or that a Chacham who permits may feed to a Chacham who forbids if the latter is unaware (Ro'oh), or Shmuel served him fish with milk, and Rav did not ask in what the fish was cooked (Be'er Sheva, who gives also other answers), or that fowl had been cooked in the pot (or cold fish were put into a hot pot). Shmuel equates this to a pot used for beef (or if both were hot), but Rav is lenient, for he holds that the Torah permits fowl with milk (or because Ila'ah Gavar) - Chasam Sofer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rav Huna and R. Chiya bar Ashi ate together. One ate fish that were put (when hot) in a bowl (that was used for meat) with milk. The other ate figs and grapes during a meal without blessing on them. Each rebuked the other 'would your Rebbi do that?!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The one who ate the fish with milk holds like Shmuel, who permits this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The one who ate figs and grapes without blessing holds like R. Chiya:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> The blessing on bread exempts all foods. The blessing on wine exempts all beverages.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> The Halachah is, fish that were put (when hot) in a bowl (used for meat) may be eaten with milk;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A radish cut with a knife that was used to cut meat may not be eaten with milk.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is because radishes are pungent and absorb the Ta'am of meat from the knife, but if a gourd was cut with such a knife, after scraping off the cut surface it may be eaten with milk.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If one cut turnip stalks (with such a knife), they are permitted (with milk; Rosh - after rinsing);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If one cut beets, they are forbidden (with milk);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If one was alternately cutting turnips and beets, even the beets are permitted. (The turnips nullify the Ta'am of meat on the knife.)</p></div>
