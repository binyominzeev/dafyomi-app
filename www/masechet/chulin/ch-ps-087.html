<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHO COVERS THE BLOOD?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughtered and did not cover the blood, one who sees this must cover the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one covered the blood and it became exposed, he need not cover it again;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the wind (blew earth and) covered it, he must cover it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "V'Shafach... v'Chisahu" - the one who spills the blood (slaughters) must cover it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if he did not cover it, an onlooker is obligated?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Say to Bnei Yisrael" - they are all commanded.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Shafach... v'Chisahu" - he must cover with what he spilled, i.e. his hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He may not cover with his foot, lest Mitzvos be disgraceful in his eyes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Shafach... v'Chisahu" - the one who spills must cover it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A case occurred in which Reuven covered the blood of what Shimon slaughtered. R. Gamliel made Reuven pay Shimon 10 gold coins.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this for stealing the Mitzvah, or for depriving him of the Berachah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>From here we can learn the fine for blessing over a meal (to exempt the others, when someone else should have blessed).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Birkas ha'Mazon is only one Mitzvah, but it is four Berachos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can learn from the following story.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">A Tzeduki (heretic):</span> Different powers created the mountains and the wind. It says "the One Who formed mountains and the One Who created wind."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> The end of the verse says "Hash-m Tzevakos Shemo" (He created both.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>The Tzeduki requested three days to respond. Rebbi fasted those three days. When Rebbi was about to end his fast, another Tzeduki informed him that the first one killed himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>Rebbi invited this man to eat. Rebbi offered him 40 gold pieces if he will decline to drink the wine over which they will say Birkas ha'Mazon. (Ben Yehoyada explains this simply. Tosfos - Rebbi requested that the man not bless out loud to exempt the others. Rashi (according to Ra'ah) - he did not want the man to answer 'Amen' to the blessings, for this is like saying the blessings);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The man declined the money. A Bas Kol announced that 40 gold pieces is the value of Birkas ha'Mazon. To this day, this man's family is among the important families in Rome.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN THE MITZVAH IS FINISHED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he covered the blood and it became uncovered (he is exempt).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Why is this different than returning a lost object?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Hashev" - you mjst return it even 100 times.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> "You will cover it" teaches that he need cover only once.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the wind covered it (he must cover it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This is only if it became uncovered. If not, he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mitzvah was Nidcheh (permanently rejected, when it was covered). The Mitzvah should never apply again!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> This teaches that Dichuy does not apply to Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than if the blood was absorbed into the ground?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the blood was absorbed into the ground, one must cover it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when one can see a discoloration where the blood was absorbed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A MIXTURE OF BLOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the blood became mixed with water, if it still looks like blood, it must be covered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If blood was mixed with wine, we view the wine as if it was the same amount of water (and apply the previous law);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was mixed with blood (that is exempt from Kisuy, e.g.) of a Behemah or of a Chayah that was not slaughtered, we view it (the exempt blood) as if it were the same amount of water;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">87b----------------------------------------87b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, blood is not Mevatel (nullify) blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If blood spurted afar, or is on the knife, it must be covered;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, when is this? It is if there is no other blood (that can be covered). If there is other blood, he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> If blood (of a Korban) became mixed with water, if it has the appearance of blood, it may be thrown on the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was mixed with wine, we view the wine as if it were the same amount of water;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was mixed with Chulin blood, we view the Chulin blood as if it was the same amount of water;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, blood is not Mevatel blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> This is only if the water fell into the blood. If blood fell into water, each drop becomes Batel when it falls in.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This does not apply to Kisuy ha'Dam, for Dichuy does not apply to Mitzvos. (Once enough blood falls in to have the appearance of blood, one must cover it.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE REQUIRED APPEARANCE OF BLOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If it looks at all red, it is considered blood for atonement (on the Mizbe'ach), to be Machshir food (to receive Tum'ah), and for Kisuy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Mishnayos explicitly teach this regarding atonement and Kisuy!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His Chidush is regarding Hechsher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Clearly, diluted blood is Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is considered blood, blood is Machshir. If it is considered water, water is Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, it was diluted with rainwater (which is not Machshir unless one wanted it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since he mixed the rainwater with the blood, he showed that he wants it, so the water itself is Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the rainwater fell in the blood by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Asi of Neharvil):</span> Rav Yehudah discusses the fluid that remains when blood congeals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah of Difti):</span> If one eats (a k'Zayis of) such blood fluid he is Chayav Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>That is only if it came from a k'Zayis of proper blood. (Tosfos ha'Rosh - it is possible that the fluid has a greater volume than the blood it came from.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (A Revi'is of) such blood has Tum'as Ohel (whatever is under or over it or over the same roof as it becomes Tamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>That is only if it came from a Revi'is of proper blood.</p></div>
