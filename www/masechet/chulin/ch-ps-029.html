<p class="dedicationbox">CHULIN 29 (18 Teves) - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on  18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IF HALF IS SLAUGHTERED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3 (Beraisa):</span> If he slaughtered half the Kaneh, paused the time for a full Shechitah, and completed the Shechitah, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If half is considered like the majority, once half the Kaneh was cut, the animal is Treifah. He cannot complete the Shechitah later!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa discusses a bird, not an animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If half is like the majority, it was already slaughtered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If half is not like the majority, the Shechitah did not yet begin (since the bird can live with a half-cut Kaneh, he may finish cutting. He did not pause during the actual Shechitah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #4 (Beraisa):</span> If half the Kaneh was already cut, and he cut a drop more and completed the Shechitah, this is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If half is like the majority, if half the Kaneh was cut, it was Treifah from the beginning!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> An animal or bird is not Treifah unless a visible majority is cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> This is illogical!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(In some places), a hole of any size makes a Treifah. When only a majority makes a Tereifah, you require a visible majority;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Shechitah always requires a majority. All the more so, it should require a visible majority! (How can Rav say that half suffices?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to questions 1-4):</span> Rather, Rav and Rav Kahana both hold that half is not like a majority.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about bringing the Korban Pesach when half of Yisrael are Teme'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Half is like a majority. The Teme'im bring the Pesach b'Tum'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> Half is not like a majority. The Teme'im must wait until Pesach Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Rav say that regarding Pesach, half is like a majority?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "A man, a man who will be Tamei" teaches that a man is pushed off (until Pesach Sheni), but not a congregation. (Even half is like a congregation.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE MISHNAH DISCUSSES CHULIN AND KODSHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The majority of one Siman in a bird...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah already taught that the majority of a Siman is like the whole Siman!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Hoshaya):</span> It must teach that this applies to Chulin and Kodshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only about about Chulin. one might have thought that this is because the blood is not needed; but for Kodshim, we must throw the blood, so the entire Simanim must be cut (so all the blood will exude);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught only about about Kodshim, one might have thought that there, the majority must be cut because the blood is needed, but for Chulin, it suffices to cut half.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. The majority is necessary and sufficient for either.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which part of the Mishnah teaches about Chulin, and which teaches about Kodshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> The Reisha teaches about Chulin, and the Seifa teaches about Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Reisha says "if one slaughters." Had it referred to Kodshim, it would say "if one does Melikah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa says "the Shechitah is Kosher." If this refers to Kodshim, it should say 'the Melikah is Kosher!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since animals were discussed just before this, it says Shechitah, which applies to Kodshim animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>In the Reisha, after discussing birds, if it discussed Kodshim, it would have said 'ha'Molek'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> The Reisha says that one Siman suffices for birds. This is not true for all Kodshim. Both Simanim of Olas ha'Of must be cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa says that most of one Siman suffices for birds. This is not true for all Kodshim. Both Simanim of Olas ha'Of must be cut!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Most of one Siman' means most of each Siman.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It would have been better to say 'most of both Simanim', but this does not apply to Chatas ha'Of, in which only one Siman is cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> In the Reisha, R. Yehudah says that the veins must be cut, and Chachamim disagree.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they discuss Chulin, it is reasonable that they disagree.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they discussed Kodshim, why would Chachamim disagree? The blood must be collected!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> The next Mishnah (30b) says that if one slaughtered two animals together, this is Kosher, b'Di'eved.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Granted, this is b'Di'eved regarding Kodshim, like Rav Yosef taught;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "Tizbach (you (singular) will slaughter)" - two people may not slaughter one Korban. "Tizbechehu (you will slaughter it (singular))" - one may not slaughter two Korbanos at once.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> (Even though we pronounce it "Tizbechuhu (you (plural) will slaughter)"), we expound based on how it is written in the Torah, "Tizbechehu".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This cannot refer to Chulin, for l'Chatchilah, one may slaughter two Chulin animals at one time! (Presumably, the Seifa of our Mishnah discusses the same case as the coming Mishnah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>The following shows that also Reish Lakish holds that the Reisha teaches Chulin, and the Seifa teaches Kodshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> Since we already learned that the majority of a Siman is like the full Siman, why must the Mishnah conclude that the majority of one Siman in a bird, or the majority of two Simanim in an animal, is enough?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish - Mishnah):</span> They brought the Tamid (daily offering) to the Kohen Gadol (on Yom Kipur). He slaughters the majority of both Simanim, and someone else completes the Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One might have thought that if the Shechitah is not completed, it is invalid. Therefore, our Mishnah teaches that the majority of one Siman in a bird, and two in an animal, suffices.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could Reish Lakish entertain the idea that incomplete Shechitah is invalid? If so, the Kohen Gadol would have to complete the Shechitah himself!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All Avodah of Yom Kipur is valid only through the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish suggested that if the Shechitah is not completed, it is invalid mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The majority of one Siman for birds, and two Simanim for animals, is enough.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there is not even an Isur mid'Rabanan not to complete the Shechitah, why do we complete it (through someone else on Yom Kipur)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Mitzvah to complete the Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHAT COMPRISES SHECHITAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Only the last moment of Shechitah (when the majority of the Siman (in an animal, the second Siman) is cut) is considered Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The entire Shechitah (from the initial cut of a Siman until the end) is considered Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Both agree that if a Nochri slaughtered one Siman, and a Yisrael the second, the Shechitah is invalid, for the Nochri made it a Treifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In Olas ha'Of, if Melikah was done to one Siman at the bottom of the Mizbe'ach, and the second Siman was cut on top of the Mizbe'ach, all agree that this is invalid, for the Avodah of Chatas ha'Of was done to it below.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They argue only in a case that one Siman was slaughtered outside the Mikdash, and the second in the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yochanan holds that the entire Shechitah is considered Shechitah, therefore he is liable for Shechutei Chutz (slaughtering a Korban outside the Mikdash);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Reish Lakish holds that only the last moment is considered Shechitah, therefore he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Simi):</span> Rav Yosef argues with this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If one Siman was slaughtered outside the Mikdash, and the other Siman inside, all agree that he is liable, for one Siman suffices for Chatas ha'Of.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They argue when the minority of the Simanim were slaughtered outside the Mikdash, and the rest in the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yochanan holds that the entire Shechitah is considered Shechitah, so he is liable for Shechutei Chutz;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Reish Lakish holds that only the last moment is considered Shechitah, so he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira - Mishnah):</span> Anyone who performs any Avodah of the Parah Adumah, from the beginning until the end, (he and) his clothes become Teme'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he engages in another task while engaged in the Parah Adumah, he disqualifies the Parah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the Parah became disqualified during the Shechitah, (he and) his clothes do not become Tamei, whether his Avodah was before or after it became disqualified;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the Parah became Pasul during the sprinkling (of its blood) --</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If his Avodah was before the Pesul, they become Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If his Avodah was afterwards, they are Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Culmination of question):</span> If the entire Shechitah is considered Shechitah, also when it became Pasul during Shechitah, they should become Tamei if his Avodah was before the Pesul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> When it becomes Pasul during Shechitah, this reveals that the entire Shechitah was invalid from the beginning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> According to Reish Lakish, only the end of Shechitah is considered Shechitah. The Mishnah should distinguish in a case when the Parah is valid (regarding two who slaughtered);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If two people slaughtered, only the one who finishes the Shechitah is Metamei his clothes!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> The Mishnah does not discuss that case, because two people may not slaughter it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Tizbach" teaches that two may not slaughter one Korban. "Tizbechuhu" - one may not slaughter two Korbanos at once.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> Even though we read "Tizbechuhu", it is written "Tizbechehu".</p></div>
