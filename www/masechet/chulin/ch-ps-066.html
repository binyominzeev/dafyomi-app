<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF EXPOUNDING THE VERSE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael and Tana #1 (i.e. of Beraisa #1, 65a) argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about a species with the four Simanim, but the head is long;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tana #1 expounds as follows. "That it has legs" is a Klal. "Arbeh Sal'am Chargol Chagav l'Minehu" are Peratim; (Usually, l'Minehu is a Klal. Since it does not resemble the first Klal (see below), Tana #1 does not consider this to be a Klal, Prat and Klal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>From a Klal u'Frat we learn only the Prat, i.e. only that species. We include (from l'Minehu) only what resembles the Prat in two aspects (Tosfos - both the important and non-important aspects).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael expounds as follows. "That it has legs" is a Klal. "Arbeh Sal'am Chargol Chagav" are Peratim. "L'Minehu" is another Klal;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A Klal, Prat u'Chlal teaches what is similar to the Prat, i.e. what resembles the Prat in one aspect (Tosfos - the important aspects).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The latter Klal is unlike the former!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The first Klal ("that it has legs") permits all species with legs. The latter Klal ("l'Minehu") permits only those with all four Simanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael expounds Klal Prat u'Chlal even when the Kelalim are dissimilar.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This Beraisa is the source that Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael expounds this way.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If it is called Chagav, even if it lacks the other Simanim (it is permitted)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "L'Minehu" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why would we think to permit it without the Simanim? The Peratim (Arbeh... ) all have the Simanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This objection would be valid had the Torah not written "Sal'am". However, it wrote Sal'am to include species with a long head. One might have thought that it includes even species without the Simanim. "L'Minehu" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Tana said that "Sal'am" is Rashon and "Chargol" is Niful. Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael said the opposite!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Each Tana teaches according to what people call the species in his locale.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SIMANIM OF KOSHER FISH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any fish with Senapir and Kaskeses (fins and scales) is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following are Tehorim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A fish that doesn't have scales now, but will grow them later, such as Sultanis (sardine or herring) and Afian (anchovy);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A fish that has scales, but loses them when it leaves the water, such as Akonas.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">66b----------------------------------------66b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Every fish that has scales has fins. Such a fish is Tahor. Some fish have fins but no scales. They are Teme'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since it depends only on scales, why did the Torah say that it must have fins and scales?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah only written "Kaskeses", one might have thought that the word means 'fins' (and he would permit a Tamei fish)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It wrote both, for clearly one means fins, and the other means scales.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Kaskeses means scales?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He was clothed in armor of Kaskeses."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we may learn from here, why did the Torah need to write both?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> The Torah added (extra ways to know what is permitted) even though it was not necessary.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FISH THAT ARE PERMITTED WITHOUT THE SIMANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Since the Torah permits fish with Simanim, we know that fish without the Simanim are forbidden. Since the Torah forbids fish without Simanim, we know that fish with Simanim are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Torah need to write both?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This forbids eating Tamei fish with a Lav and an Aseh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "you may eat all that is in water... "?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In two places the Torah permitted fish without the Simanim, once explicitly, and once Stam (not explicitly);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The explicit Heter was for fish (without Simanim in water) in Kelim. Perhaps also the Stam Heter permits (only) this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You may eat all that is in water... " permits bending down and drinking water from a pit or cave (no matter which fish are inside).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which verse permits fish in Kelim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "This you will eat, among all that is in water... (in seas and rivers)" - in seas and rivers, we may eat only fish with Simanim, but in Kelim, we may eat fish even without Simanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Why don't we rather say that in Kelim, we may not eat even fish with Simanim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Any fish that does not have fins and scales, in seas and rivers... " - in seas and rivers, we may not eat fish without Simanim, but in Kelim, we may eat them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that "in water" is a Klal, and "in seas and rivers" is a Prat. A Klal u'Frat includes only the Prat, i.e. seas and rivers, but not Charitzin u'Ne'itzin (channels of flowing water. There, all fish are permitted)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah gives another Klal "in water" (so we expound a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The two Kelalim come together, and the Peratim are after them! (This is not a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal!)</p></div>
