<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HOW MUCH MUST BE SLAUGHTERED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughters one Siman of a bird, or two Simanim of an animal, this is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Cutting) the majority of a Siman is like (cutting) the whole Siman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he must also cut the veins.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he slaughtered half a Siman of a bird, or one Siman and half the other Siman of an animal, this is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The majority of one (Siman) of a bird, or the majority of two of an animal is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The phrase 'if one slaughters' connotes b'Di'eved. In an animal, what more should he cut than the two Simanim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This was said due to one Siman of a bird (which is b'Di'eved).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This was said due to 'the majority of a Siman is like the whole Siman' (which is b'Di'eved).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HOW WE KNOW WHERE TO SLAUGHTER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Shechitah is done from the neck?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> "V'Shachat (he will slaughter) the bull" - from the place that Shach (it bends), Chatehu (make it permissible or be Metaher it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that 'Chatei' pertains to Taharah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "V'Chitei (he will be Metaher) the house (that had Tzara'as)."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Techateni (purify me) with hyssop, and I will be Tahor."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also the tail bends. Perhaps that is the place of Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "It bends" connotes that it is normally erect.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Shechitah is from the ear!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (From Kodshim we know that) Shechitah must cause Dam ha'Nefesh (the blood that leaves when the animal dies) to come out.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (#1):</span> Perhaps he begins cutting at the ear, and continues until he reaches the place of Dam ha'Nefesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rashi - Question #2; Tosfos - counter-question):</span> What is the source that pausing, Derasah, Chaladah, Hagramah and Ikur disqualify Shechitah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that these are a tradition from Moshe from Sinai.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A tradition from Sinai teaches also that Shechitah is from the neck!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should not sever the head (Rashi - by doing Derasah; Tosfos - by cutting from the back of the neck).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yeimar):</span> "V'Zovachto" - from the place that Zav (it flows), Chatei (break) it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that 'Chatei' (with a 'Tav') pertains to breaking?</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Shechitah is at the nose. Mucus flows from there!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must flow due to being cut. Mucus flows by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (#1):</span> Perhaps he cuts the heart!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> We read "v'Shachat" like 'v'Sochat', from the place that Soch (it speaks), Chatei (Metaher) it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this is from the tongue!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We require that through Shechitah, Dam ha'Nefesh leaves the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he begins cutting at the tongue, and continues until he reaches the Dam ha'Nefesh!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why were the head and Chelev singled out? They are included in the sections!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "he will flay the Olah and dissect" teaches that only parts that are flayed are considered sections!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Its head and its Pader" includes the head, even though it was already severed.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>From this we infer that Shechitah is from the neck.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana initially asked about began asking about the verse "the head and the Pader", but then expounded the verse "its head and its Pader"!</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Its head and its Pader he will arrange" teaches that the head and Chelev are offered first.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "the Pader" mentioned in the first verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> He covers the slaughtered neck with the Chelev and offers them. This is a dignified way to serve Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5:</span> We learn the place of Shechitah like R. Eliezer does:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "This is the law of animals and fowl" - in what respect do they have the same law?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Their Tum'os are different. An animal Neveilah is Metamei one who touches or moves it, but not one who eats it (if it does not touch him externally), whereas the Neveilah of a Tahor bird is Metamei one who eats it (and it is even Metamei his clothes), but not one who touches or moves it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, just like animals require Shechitah, also fowl.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like the majority of both Simanim of an animal must be slaughtered, the same applies to birds!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "This" (applies only to animals).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Eliezer):</span> The Torah teaches that just like (Korbanos of) birds become permitted (through Melikah) from the neck, also animals become permitted (through Shechitah) from the neck.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps animals are slaughtered from the back of the neck, similar to Melikah of birds!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "U'Malak its head on the back of the neck" - the head (of a bird) is cut from the back of the neck, but not of animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Eliezer learn from "this"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that just like Korbanos of birds are permitted through cutting one Siman, also animals. "This" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ONE SIMAN SUFFICES FOR BIRDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Bar Kapara):</span> "This is the law of animals and birds (and... fish)" mentions birds between animals and fish.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We cannot say that both Simanim of a bird must be slaughtered, for birds are Hukshu (written next) to fish. (Birds should resemble fish, which do not need any Shechitah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We cannot say that neither Siman of a bird need be slaughtered, for birds are Hukshu to animals. (They should resemble animals, in which both Simanim must be slaughtered)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rather, one Siman must be slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that fish need not be slaughtered?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "Ha'Tzon u'Vakar Yishachet... Degei ha'Yam Ye'asef" teaches that Asifah (gathering) suffices for fish.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should say the same about Slav (the fowl given in the Midbar), about which it says "va'Ya'asfu Es ha'Slav"!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We said above that since birds are Hukshu to animals, one Siman must be slaughtered!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we learn from "ha'Tzon...";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Ha'Tzon..." mentions Shechitah of animals, and correspondingly, gathering fish. "Va'Ya'asfu Es ha'Slav" does not correlate this to Shechitah, so we do not learn from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Uvar of Galil):</span> Animals were created (in the six days of creation) from the dry land, and both of their Simanim must be slaughtered. Fish were created from the water, and they are permitted without any Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Birds were created from the mud. One Siman must be slaughtered to permit them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Shmuel Kaputka'ah):</span> Birds have scales like fish (their creation from the mud is manifest in them, so presumably their law resembles that of fish).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (a Nochri mayor):</span> "The waters will swarm with living swarming things, and birds will fly" shows that birds were created from water;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Hash-m formed from the ground, every beast of the field, and all birds of the sky" shows that birds were created from the ground!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "He will spill (its blood)" teaches that the Torah does not require Shechitah of birds. It suffices to spill the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should say the same about Chayos (which are in the same verse)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chayos are equated to Korbanos that became blemished. (This teaches that they must be slaughtered.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "This is the law of animals and birds" equates the laws of animals and birds!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will spill" teaches that regarding Shechitah, birds are different.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The verse discusses birds and Chayos. Why do you say that it teaches about birds?) Perhaps it teaches about Chayos (that they not require Shechitah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will spill" is written next to birds, so it is more reasonable to learn the former way.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Shechitah was invalid and the animal became a Neveilah; or if he did Nechirah (tore the Simanim lengthwise) or uprooted the Simanim, he is exempt from covering the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Torah does not require Shechitah of birds, Nechirah of birds is like Shechitah of Chayos. The Mitzvah to cover the blood should apply!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah does not discuss birds. Rather, it says that Nechirah of Chayos does not require covering the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one slaughters because he needs the blood, he must cover it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>To exempt himself from having to cover it, he should uproot the Simanim or do Nechirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Beraisa discusses birds. The blood is needed due to worms that infest wool.</p></div>
