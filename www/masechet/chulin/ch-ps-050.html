<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> In Eretz Yisrael, they eat (one of these Chalavim). We (in Bavel) may not rely on it to seal?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael and Bavel agree that Chelev of the Keshes (bow, i.e. on the outside of the Kevah, which is bow-shaped) is forbidden. They argue about eating Chelev of the string (inside of the bow. This is Bar Chimtza. All agree that it seals.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael and Bavel agree that the Chelev of the string is permitted. They argue about the Chelev of the bow. (Rashi - according to this, all Chelev on the Kevah seals. This is unlike Rav Nachman (g); Tosfos - it is like Rav Nachman, but we must say that his teaching (j:1) was not said in astonishment, rather simply. In Eretz Yisrael, they eat (Chelev of the bow, this is Bar Chimtza. In Bavel, we do not eat it.) We may not even rely on it to seal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Avya):</span> A small amount of Chelev over the string (Version #1; Version #2 - over the bow) must be removed (because Chelev of the Kevah, which all agree is forbidden, is over it). The rest is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Avya:</span> I saw R. Ami remove a little and eat the remainder.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chanina (to his attendant):</span> Remove a little, and give the remainder to me to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He saw that his attendant was hesitant. He said 'you are from Bavel. You must remove all of it.'</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HOLES IN THE INNARDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If the innards were punctured and fluid covers them, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What fluid is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> It is a thick fluid that clings to the innards from the inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Zeira, citing R. Aba):</span> The Halachah is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel regarding fluid of the innards, and like R. Shimon regarding Avelus (mourning).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> R. Aba, son of R. Chiya bar Aba, received these two rulings from R. Zeira.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was away when his relative died, if he was within one day's journey, and returned within the first three days of Avelus, he counts the (seven and 30) days of Avelus like the mourners here;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he comes after three days, or came from more than one day's journey, he counts the days of Avelus from when he heard of the death;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon says, if he was less than a day away, even if he arrives on the seventh day, he counts like the mourners here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>A Talmid heard the above rulings, and yearned to go to Eretz Yisrael to hear them himself from the source.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(The Talmid citing R. Aba, the son of R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> The Halachah is not like R. Shimon ben Gamliel. There is dispute regarding Aveilus:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Chisda and R. Yochanan say that the Halachah follows R. Shimon. Rav Nachman says that the Halachah does not follow him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The Halachah is not like R. Shimon ben Gamliel. The Halachah follows R. Shimon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> In Aveilus, the Halachah always follows the lenient opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Simi bar Chiya):</span> If we are unsure whether a puncture in the innards came before or after Shechitah, we may puncture other innards. If the wound resembles the fresh wound, the animal is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>A case came in front of Rava. The fresh wound was unlike the Safek wound. His son Rav Mesharshiya pressed the freshly punctured innards. Then, they resembled the Safek case.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> How did you think to do that?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Mesharshiya:</span> The innards were pressed (in the place of the Safek wound) before you saw them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and R. Elazar):</span> We may compare a puncture in the lungs (to a fresh puncture).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We may compare punctures on the same side, but not if they are on opposite sides (right and left) of the lungs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Halachah is, we may compare even on opposite sides, but not from a small chamber to a large chamber (Rashi; Tosfos - not from a large animal to a small animal).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> We may compare punctures in the Kaneh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is only within the same Chulyah (ring; Rashi - three rings), but not to a different Chulyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Halachah is, we may compare one Chulyah to another, or one Bar Chulyah (the flesh that covers and connects the rings) to another, but not a Chulyah to a Bar Chulyah or vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> If the end of the large intestine was punctured, it is Kosher, because the legs seal it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much must be cut to make it Tereifah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ilai):</span> If the majority is cut where it clings to the legs, it is Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Where it does not cling, a puncture of any size is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rabanan told this to Rava in Rav Nachman's name.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">50b----------------------------------------50b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> That is wrong! Rav Nachman said that where it clings, even if it is entirely removed, it is Kosher, as long as there remains enough (for a person) to hold.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered enough to hold?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Room for four fingers (Rashi - one finger) suffices (even) for an ox. (Shulchan Aruch - a smaller animal needs proportionally less.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TEREIFOS IN THE KERES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the inner Keres (first stomach) was punctured (it is Tereifah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav Yehudah and R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> The inner Keres is the caecum (blind gut).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (R. Yishmael):</span> It is the stomach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #3 (Rav Asi):</span> It is a thin place in the Keres, I do not know where.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> This does not help us at all!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Rav Ava):</span> He refers to below where the Keres narrows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #4 (R. Yakov bar Nachmani):</span> It is the part of the Keres not covered by 'wool'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #5 (R. Avina):</span> It is the last Tefach on the Veshet before the Keres.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #6 (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> It is the entire Keres;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The outer Keres is the skin covering most of the Keres.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #7 (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> It is the Mafra'ata.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Mafra'ata?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Avya):</span> It is where a butcher is Por'e'a (opens) the animal to remove the innards (i.e. the part facing the ground).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Butchers in Nehardai conducted like Rabah bar Rav Huna and Rav Asi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Are they not concerned for the other opinions?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> All are included in Rabah bar Rav Huna's opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Rav Asi's opinion is unclear!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> Rav Acha bar Ava clarified it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> The opinions of R. Avina and Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael are not included in Rabah bar Rav Huna's opinion!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, they are not. (The butchers are not concerned for those opinions.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> (The majority is for a small ox.) For a large one (if a Tefach tears, it is Tereifah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Binyamin bar Yefet):</span> He does not refer to the largest and smallest oxen found;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, if a Tefach is torn and this is not the majority of the Keres, this is large, and it is Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the majority is torn and it is less than a Tefach, this is small, and it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is when the majority is just less than a Tefach (Rashi; Tosfos - when the Keres is more than a Tefach). One might have thought that a full Tefach is required. R. Yehudah teaches that this is not so).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Geneiva):</span> A (round) hole the size of a Sela (a coin) makes it a Tereifah. If it were stretched out, it would be a Tefach. (Tosfos - a one-Tefach string goes around the perimeter, i.e. the diameter of the hole is about a third of a Tefach. Rashi says that if one pulls on both sides, he can stretch them a Tefach apart. I.e. the circumference of the hole is two Tefachim, so the diameter is about two thirds of a Tefach. To reolve this with the coming Gemara, he must explain that dates used to be much bigger than they are nowadays. - <b>PF</b>)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba citing Geneiva):</span> Up to a Sela is Kosher. More than this is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we gauge if it is more than a Sela?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If three (average) date pits with some fruit attached can be squeezed through, or if three clean date pits fit through easily, it is more than a Sela.</p></div>
