<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MEAT FROM EVER MIN HA'CHAI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Asi and R. Zeira):</span> In the Seifa, why is it Tamei? It is Tum'as Beis ha'Starim (the contact between the meat and the Tum'ah (the Ever it was cut from, at the time it was cut) is concealed)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> The Beraisa is like R. Meir, who holds that Tum'as Beis ha'Starim is Metamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Asi):</span> I already refuted R. Aba. R. Meir says so only regarding Tum'ah that does not need Hechsher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Perhaps the Beraisa discusses meat that was already Huchshar!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Rav Chanan):</span> Why is Hechsher needed? The meat already had severe Tum'ah (Ever Min ha'Chai)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The meat was not considered a food at the time. (Therefore, it needs Hechsher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Until the meat was cut off, it was not considered food. It could not receive Hechsher.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>FOOD THAT CEASES TO BE CONSIDERED FOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Se'or (sourdough) was designated to sit on, it is Batel. (One may keep it on Pesach. It receives Tum'as Mishkav.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Its Tum'ah is mid'Rabanan, for food is never an Av ha'Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (It can be an Av mid'Oraisa.) After designation, it is not considered a food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Something offered to idolatry has Tum'as Ohel. This is mid'Rabanan, for a food is never an Av ha'Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (It can be mid'Oraisa.) Once it is forbidden, (one may not eat it, so) it is no longer considered a food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If food was left to remain in (a crack in) a Kli, it becomes like the Kli. (If it touches a Mes, it becomes an Av ha'Tum'ah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This Tum'ah is mid'Rabanan, for a food is never an Av ha'Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (It can be mid'Oraisa.) After abandoning it, it is not considered a food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In a village, Chelev of a Nevelah receives Tum'as Ochlim only after one intends to feed it to a Nochri and it is Huchshar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This shows that Tum'as Nevelah of Chelev enveloping the kidney (of a Nevelah) must be mid'Rabanan, for food is never an Av ha'Tum'ah. (Rashi, according to Maharsha - something can be an Av ha'Tum'ah before it is a food, but this cannot apply to Chelev around the kidney, for if so it would not require Hechsher afterwards.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> (It can be mid'Oraisa.) It is not Tamei like a food, rather, like a Shomer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Masnah):</span> If one made a roof from vegetation, the vegetation (becomes Tahor and - some texts delete this) is considered like a roof;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the house gets Tzara'as, the roof is Tamei. This Tum'ah is mid'Rabanan, for food is never an Av ha'Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (It can be mid'Oraisa.) After making a roof from it, it is not considered a food.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>R. SHIMON'S OPINION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Shimon is Metaher (the limb, when the animal dies).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In any case, this is difficult!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If when it dies, we consider it as if the limb fell off (before death), it is Tamei like Ever Min ha'Chai;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we do not consider it as if it fell off (before death), it is Tamei like a limb of a Nevelah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Shimon refers to the Reisha;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Dangling limbs or flesh of an animal receive Tum'as Ochlim (while dangling), and require Hechsher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon is Metaher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> "Any food that may be eaten" - only a food that you may feed to Nochrim is considered a food (to receive Tum'as Ochlim).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">129b----------------------------------------129b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (and Answer #2 - R. Zeira):</span> He should be Metaher because it is still attached (like you yourself answered. He should not need a verse!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If a fig branch was cut and it is attached through the bark, it is Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Chachamim are Metaher only if the branch can heal.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Asi):</span> Any attachment to something alive is Metaher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Asi):</span> Rather, R. Yochanan teaches that in the middle clause, R. Shimon learns from a verse:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the animal is slaughtered, (the limb or meat) receives Hechsher through the blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> "Any food that may be eaten" - only a food that you may feed to Nochrim is considered a food.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (and Answer #2):</span> Perhaps R. Shimon's reason is like Rabah or R. Yochanan above! (An animal is not a Yad for one limb, or because the larger piece does not come with the smaller piece. He does not need a verse!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Indeed, R. Yochanan explained R. Shimon's reason in the Seifa. R. Shimon discusses only dangling meat, but not a limb:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If the animal dies, the flesh requires Hechsher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, it is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> "Any food that may be eaten" - only a food that you may feed to Nochrim is considered a food.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>LIMBS AND MEAT FROM A LIVING ANIMAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Dangling limbs and flesh of a person are Tehorim. If he dies, the flesh is Tahor. The limb has Tum'as Ever Min ha'Chai, but not like Tum'as Ever Min ha'Mes;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon is Metaher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> In any case, R. Shimon's opinion is difficult!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If when it dies, we consider it as if the limb fell off (before death), it is Tamei like an Ever Min ha'Chai!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we do not consider it as if the limb fell off (before death), it is Tamei like an Ever Min ha'Mes!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Shimon comes to argue with R. Meir:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir said that the limb is Tamei like Ever Min ha'Chai, but not like Ever Min ha'Mes. This implies that Ever Min ha'Mes is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon is Metaher. (He holds like R. Eliezer below.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> I heard that Ever Min ha'Chai is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Are you Metamei only of a Chai, but not of a Mes? A Kal va'Chomer is Metamei Ever Min ha'Mes!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A living person is Tahor, yet Ever Min ha'Chai is Tamei. A Mes is Tamei, so all the more so, Ever Min ha'Mes is Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> In Megilas Ta'anis (a list of days on which we do not fast or eulogize), it says that we do not eulogize on Pesach Sheni. All the more so, Pesach itself is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>You must admit that the list omits Pesach, for we can derive it through a Kal va'Chomer;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Similarly, the one who taught you that Ever Min ha'Chai is Metamei omitted Ever Min ha'Mes, because it follows from a Kal va'Chomer!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> I heard that Ever Min ha'Chai is Tamei, to exclude Ever Min ha'Mes!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the Tum'ah of Ever Min ha'Chai and Ever Min ha'Mes (according to R. Meir, in our Mishnah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The difference is a k'Zayis of flesh or a bone ka'Adashah (the size of a lentil) that separated from them:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a k'Zayis of flesh separated from Ever Min ha'Chai, it is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Nechunyah ben Hakanah and R. Yehoshua are Metaher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Nechunyah says, if a bone ka'Adashah separated from Ever Min ha'Chai, it is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua are Metaher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (b)):</span> Since Tana'im argue about a k'Zayis of flesh or a bone ka'Adashah that separated from Ever Min ha'Chai, we can say that R. Shimon likewise argues with R. Meir about this!</p></div>
