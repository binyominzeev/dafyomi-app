<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Presumably, Rav Asi is correct, for R. Aba taught that Chelev that is covered by flesh is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because the Torah forbids Chelev on the flanks, but not in the flanks;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Similarly, it forbids Chelev on the kidney, but not in the kidney.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba citing Shmuel):</span> Chelev that is covered by flesh is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Rav Asi cited Shmuel to say that Chelev under the loins is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> When an animal walks, that Chelev becomes exposed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> One is Chayav Kares for eating Chelev on the Masas or on the Beis ha'Kosos. This is the Chelev on the Kerev (innards.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> If one eats Chelev of the hip he is Chayav Kares. This is the Chelev on the flanks.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> Strands in the foreleg are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Safra):</span> Did the Torah forbid all meat?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rava):</span> Did the Torah permit blood?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, after cutting them and salting them, the strands may even be cooked in a pot (no blood remains).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One must scrape off the Chelev from the first Amah of the small intestine (after the stomach). This is the Chelev on the small intestines.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Strands in the flanks are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There are five forbidden strands, three on the right side of the animal, and two on the left.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Three of them branch off into two smaller branches (each). Two of them branch off into three smaller branches (each);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is important to know for digging them out.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If they are removed when the meat is warm, they come out intact. If not, one must dig them out.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> There are five forbidden strands. Three are forbidden due to Chelev, and two due to blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Strands in the spleen, loins and kidney are forbidden due to Chelev. Those of the foreleg and jaw are due to blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Rav Yehudah bar Oshaya was peeling the Chelev off the top of the spleen for Levi, the son of Rav Huna bar Chiya.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Levi:</span> You must peel also lower on the spleen!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Oshaya:</span> Rav said that only the Chelev on the thick part is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah bar Oshaya):</span> Rav Hamnuna taught that the layer covering the spleen is forbidden, but one is not liable for eating it!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which Chelev on the spleen does he refer?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>He does not mean the Chelev on the thick part. One is liable for it!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he refers to the Chelev on the rest of it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Oshaya:</span> If he said so, I accept it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>(Rav Hamnuna) The layer covering the spleen is forbidden, but one is not liable for eating it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The layer covering the kidney is forbidden, but one is not liable for eating it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One is liable for them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is liable for the Chelev on the thick part of the spleen, but not on the rest. One is liable for the top layer of Chelev on the kidneys, but not the bottom layer.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BEITZIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami or Rav Asi):</span> If Beitzim are barely connected, they are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of R. Ami and Rav Asi):</span> They are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first opinion says, since they will never heal, it is as if they fell off. They are forbidden like Ever Min ha'Chai;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">93b----------------------------------------93b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The second opinion permits. Since they do not decay, this shows that they are alive.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The first opinion says that they do not decay because they are not exposed to air.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The second opinion says that they do not heal due to weakness.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan (to R. Shimon bar Aba):</span> They are permitted, but you should not eat them - "do not abandon the Torah of your mother."</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was less than one month old, the covering need not be peeled off;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was over one month, they are forbidden if there is semen inside. If not, they are permitted.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If inside there are red streaks, they are forbidden. If not, they are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Everywhere that Rav Acha and Ravina argue, Ravina is lenient and Rav Acha is stringent, with only three exceptions - raw meat, Beitzim, and veins;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Halachah always follows the lenient opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If raw meat is very red (because the animal was hit while alive, and blood gathered) -</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is cut and salted, it may even be cooked in a pot.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Alternatively, it suffices to roast it on a spit, for the blood will exude.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the meat is over coals, Rav Acha is lenient, and Ravina is stringent;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rav Acha says that the coals help draw out the blood. Ravina says that they cause the blood to stay inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>They argue similarly about Beitzim and veins.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> There are two Gidim. The inner one (near the bone) is forbidden, and one is liable for eating it;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a butcher removed the Chelev but left over k'Se'orah (the size of a barley seed), he is punished;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> The k'Se'orah must be in one place, but the k'Zayis may be spread over several places.</p></div>
