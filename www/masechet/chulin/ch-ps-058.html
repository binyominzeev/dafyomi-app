<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (according to Rav Acha - Ameimar):</span> If a female bird became a Tereifah, eggs that were inside at the time are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Eggs that formed later are permitted, for Zeh v'Zeh Gorem (something that comes from two sources, one of which (in this case, the father) is permitted) is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> They (Rashi - R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua; Tosfos - Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel) agree that eggs of a Tereifah are forbidden, for they grew inside a forbidden bird.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> That refers to eggs that developed without a male (the hen warmed itself in the earth).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he answer that the Mishnah discusses eggs inside the bird when it became Tereifah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should not say that the eggs grew inside a forbidden bird, rather, that they were completed inside a forbidden bird.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> The child of a Tereifah may not be offered (for a Korban);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, it may be offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to Ameimar, surely they argue about when the mother became Tereifah, and then it became pregnant. R. Eliezer forbids Zeh v'Zeh Gorem, and R. Yehoshua permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If so, why do they argue about Korbanos? The argument applies even to Chulin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about Korbanos to show the extremity of R. Yehoshua's opinion. The child is Kosher even for a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They should argue about Chulin to show the extremity of R. Eliezer's opinion, who forbids even Chulin!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to show the extremity of the lenient opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They agree that eggs of a Tereifah are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This discusses eggs that developed without a male. They are due solely to the mother.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Version #1 is like Rav Acha, who holds like Rav Acha bar Yakov. Ravina argues with Rav Acha bar Yakov, and reported the discussion differently.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Ravina - (Ameimar):</span> If a female bird became a Safek Tereifah, we hold onto eggs that were inside at the time:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the bird later forms more eggs, all the eggs are permitted. If it does not form more eggs, the (first) eggs are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> They agree that eggs of a Tereifah are forbidden, for they grew inside a forbidden animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> This discusses eggs inside the bird when it became Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should not say that the eggs grew inside a forbidden bird, rather, that they were completed inside a forbidden bird!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Mishnah should say that they were completed inside a forbidden bird.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> One may not offer offspring of a Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehoshua permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to Ameimar, surely they argue about when the mother became Tereifah when it was already pregnant. R. Eliezer holds that a fetus is like a limb of the mother (when the mother becomes Tereifah, also the fetus is forbidden). R. Yehoshua holds that the fetus is independent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If so, why do they argue about Korbanos? The argument applies even to Chulin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about Korbanos to show the extremity of R. Yehoshua's opinion. The child is Kosher even for a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They should argue about Chulin to show the extremity of R. Eliezer's opinion, who forbids even Chulin!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They agree that eggs of a Tereifah are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This discusses eggs that were inside when it became Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are like part of the bird. (They became forbidden with it.) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>The Halachah is, if a Safek Tereifah male lives 12 months, it is Kosher. If a Safek Tereifah female bears new eggs, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Any creature without bones cannot last 12 months.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> From Rav Huna's teaching we may derive the coming (second) law of Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a gourd became wormy while growing, it is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">58b----------------------------------------58b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Dates that were harvested 12 months ago are permitted. (We assume that any worms inside developed inside and never left. They were not "Shoretz Al ha'Aretz". Rosh (citing Ra'avad) - even though dead worms are forbidden, after 12 months, they are totally dry. They are like earth.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A mosquito does not live more than a day. A fly does not live more than a year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> People say that a female mosquito rebelled on her husband for seven years because he once enjoyed sucking a man's blood without telling her!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question (Abaye):</span> People also say that one can hang 60 Manim (huge measures) of iron on a mosquito's stinger. Of course that cannot be. It is too small!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, relative to its size, one can hang 60 Manim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Similarly, relative to its lifespan, it rebelled for seven years.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>EXTRA OR MISSING ORGANS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an animal has five or three legs, this is a blemish;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This refers to the forelegs, but a missing or extra hind leg is a Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because anything extra is considered as if it is missing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>There was a Chayah with an extra Sanya Divi (blind gut). Ravina ruled that it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the two Sanya Divi pour into each other, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>An animal had a conduit connecting the Beis ha'Kosos and the Masas; Rav Ashi was about to rule that it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Huna Mar bar Chiya:</span> All self-grazing animals have such a conduit!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>An animal had a conduit connecting the Beis ha'Kosos and the Keres. Mar bar Rav Ashi was about to rule that it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Oshaya:</span> You cannot extrapolate! We said that it is Kosher only when the conduit connects the Beis ha'Kosos and the Masas!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Noson bar Shilo was the chief Shochet of Tzipori. He testified in front of Rebbi that two (beginnings of) small intestines in an animal is Tereifah. In a bird, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This applies only if they emanate from two places; but if they emanate from one place, and finish within a finger's width, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ami or Rav Asi):</span> It is Kosher only if they later rejoin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Ami and Rav Asi):</span> It is Kosher even if they don't later rejoin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>According to the first opinion, they must merge within a finger's width.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the second opinion, what is the meaning of 'they finish within a finger's width'?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They merge at least a finger's width before the rectum.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>IF THE SMALL FEATHERS ARE MISSING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If the small feathers are missing, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yehudah and R. Yishmael agree with each other;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> The small feathers join. (Rashi - regarding Chutz li'Zmano, intent to eat these feathers is like intent to eat the meat. Tosfos - they join to the meat to comprise a Shi'ur (the volume of an egg) for Tum'as Ochlim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Perhaps they argue with each other!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps R. Yehudah said only that if the feathers are missing it is Tereifah, for they are needed to protect the skin, but he holds like Chachamim, they are not like meat;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Perhaps R. Yishmael said only that they are like meat, but even without them it is Kosher, for they do not protect the skin!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>FOODS THAT CAN KILL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following animals are Kosher:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One that was afflicted by excess blood, or inhaled smoke, or became sick through chills, or ate Hardufni (a poison that kills animals), or ate cat excrement, or drank exposed water (into which snakes may have put venom);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If it ate a poison (that kills people) or was bitten by a snake, it is Kosher, but one may not eat it lest the meat is poisonous.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> If Chiltis (a hard, pointy plant) is put down an animal's throat, it is Tereifah, for it will puncture the innards.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shizbi - Beraisa):</span> If an animal was afflicted by excess blood, or inhaled smoke, became sick through chills, ate Hardufni, or ate cat excrement, drank exposed water, or if Chiltis, Tei'ah or peppers were put down its throat, or it ate poison, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was bitten by a snake or a rabid dog, it is Kosher, but one may not eat it, due to danger.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This Beraisa refutes Shmuel regarding Chiltis, and contradicts the Mishnah regarding poison!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> Shmuel discusses eating stalks of Chiltis. The Beraisa discusses leaves of Chiltis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> The Beraisa discusses poison that kills animals. The Mishnah discusses poison that kills people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa discusses also Hardufni, which kills animals! (Surely, the 'poison' it refers to kills people.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It discusses Hardufni and another poison that kills animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Tei'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is the poisonous root of aconite.</p></div>
