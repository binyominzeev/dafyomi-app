<p class="dedicationbox">CHULIN 31-43 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SLAUGHTERING A PARAH ADUMAH TOGETHER WITH ANOTHER ANIMAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one slaughtered a Parah Adumah together with another animal, all agree that the Parah is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If another animal was slaughtered (unintentionally) with the Parah Adumah --</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to R. Noson, the Parah is invalid, and the other animal is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to Chachamim, the Parah is valid, and the other animal is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is the case of another animal slaughtered unintentionally, according to R. Noson;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that "he will slaughter it", but not it and another, disqualifies only slaughtering two Paros Adumos at once, but not one Parah and a Chulin animal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rava teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If he cut a gourd while slaughtering a Parah Adumah, it is invalid. If a gourd was cut while slaughtering the Parah, it is valid.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PAUSING DURING SHECHITAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one paused during Shechitah to pick up the knife or his clothes that fell, or to sharpen the knife, or he grew weary and someone else completed the Shechitah, if the delay was the time needed for Shechitah, the Shechitah is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon says, if it was the time to check, it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the time for Shechitah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> It is the time to slaughter another animal (i.e. from the start).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana and Rav Asi):</span> When slaughtering a bird, is the time to slaughter an animal, or the time to slaughter a bird?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav:</span> When I learned this law from R. Chiya, I was not informal enough with him to ask this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> For an animal, it is the time to slaughter an animal. For a bird, it is the time to slaughter a bird.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel and Ravin):</span> Also for a bird, it is the time to slaughter an animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> It is the time to bring an animal and slaughter it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If we must bring an animal, the time will vary, depending how far we must go to find one!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Rather, R. Chanina teaches that we include the time to cast the animal to the ground, (which the other Amora'im do not include - Rashi, based on our text. The text of many Rishonim omits these words, for all agree to this.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Sages of Eretz Yisrael, citing R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> It is the time to pick up an animal, make it crouch down, and slaughter;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>For a large animal, it is the time for a large animal. For a small animal, it is the time for a small animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one slaughters with a blunt knife, even if he spends the whole day slaughtering one animal, it is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Do small pauses join up? (If the total delay is the time for Shechitah, is the Shechitah Pasul?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava should resolve his question from the law he just taught (that they do not join up)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, he was constantly cutting. He did not pause.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna brei d'R. Noson):</span> What is the law if he paused while cutting the minority of the Simanim (Rashi - after he cut the majority; R. Tam - before cutting the majority; R. Ushiya - he cut the remainder of the Siman slowly, after he already cut its majority)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>These questions are unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A SHECHITAH THAT BECAME INVALID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1 - R. Yeshevav):</span> In the following cases, the animal is a Neveilah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He slaughtered the Veshet and uprooted the Kaneh, or uprooted the Kaneh and (then - some delete this) slaughtered the Veshet;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He slaughtered one Siman and paused until the animal died, or inserted the knife under the second Siman and slaughtered it through Chaladah (when the knife was covered up);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Akiva says, it is a Treifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yeshevav, citing R. Yehoshua):</span> Any case in which the Shechitah was Pasul, the animal is a Neveilah. If it was slaughtered properly but something else forbids the animal, it is a Treifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Akiva retracted and agreed to R. Yeshevav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction:</span> In our Mishnah, R. Akiva retracted and agreed to R. Yeshevav. Elsewhere, we see that they still disagree!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2):</span> The following are Treifos:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Veshet was punctured, or the Kaneh was uprooted...</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> In our Mishnah, the Kaneh was uprooted after the Veshet was slaughtered. A Pesul occurred in the Shechitah itself;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There, the Kaneh was uprooted before anything was slaughtered. The Pesul was not related to the Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Huna - Mishnah #1):</span> If he slaughtered the Veshet and uprooted the Kaneh, or uprooted the Kaneh and slaughtered the Veshet, it is a Neveilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Seifa really means that the Kaneh was uprooted after the Veshet was already slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rav Acha bar Huna):</span> That is precisely the Reisha!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rav Acha bar Huna - Beraisa):</span> If he uprooted the Kaneh and then slaughtered the Veshet, it is a Neveilah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If in our Mishnah he slaughtered the Veshet afterwards, also our Mishnah would have specified!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Mishnah #2 really means 'the following forbid an animal.' Some of them make it a Treifah, and others make it a Neveilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Mishnah should list also the cases of Chizkiyah and R. Elazar!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> An animal cut in half is a Neveilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If the thigh and its socket were removed, the animal is a Neveilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah lists only animals that become Tamei (Neveilah) when they are fully dead. These two cases are Tamei even when the animal is still quivering.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Reish Lakish):</span> In our Mishnah, he cut the Kaneh where its majority was already cut. This is a Pesul in the Shechitah itself (only one Siman was slaughtered);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In Mishnah #2, he cut it where it was not already cut. The Shechitah was proper, just the animal itself was a Treifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reish Lakish himself taught that if he slaughtered the Kaneh and then punctured the lungs, it is Kosher. This implies that once a Siman is cut, it (or any organ dependent on it) no longer affects the animal's status;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Here also, if the Kaneh was already cut, cutting it in a different place should not be considered Shechitah. The animal should be a Neveilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> R. Akiva taught Mishnah #2 before he retracted. Since Chachamim were used to the text of that Mishnah, it was not changed after he retracted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PROBLEMS IN THE MIDDLE OF SHECHITAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If he slaughtered the Kaneh and then punctured the lungs, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is only if the lungs were punctured, since their whole function depends on the Kaneh. If the intestines were punctured (after cutting the Kaneh), it would not be Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Zeira):</span> If you permit even though a wound that makes it a Treifah occurred after cutting one Siman, it makes no difference if the wound was in the lungs or intestines!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The following question shows that R. Zeira retracted. (Rashi - he retracted from his opinion that no wound (after cutting one Siman) disqualifies the Shechitah, and agreed to Rava, and then asked the following question. Tosfos - he used to think that a wound anywhere makes the animal Treifah, and asked the following question. He retracted to hold that no wound disqualifies the Shechitah, and then challenged Rava.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If the intestines were punctured after cutting one Siman, what is the law? Does the cutting of the first Siman join to the cutting of the second?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is clear to R. Zeira that the animal is forbidden. He asks whether we consider the animal to be slaughtered (and only Treifah), or a Neveilah, similar to Ilfa's question.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ilfa):</span> After one Siman of a pregnant animal was slaughtered, the fetus stuck its foot outside, and the second Siman was cut. Do we join the Simanim to say that it was included in the Shechitah, and is not a Neveilah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Surely the foot is Treifah, and one may not eat it.</p></div>
