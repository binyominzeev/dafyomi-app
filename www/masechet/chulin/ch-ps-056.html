<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TEREIFOS IN BIRDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any of the following makes a bird Tereifah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Veshet was punctured; the majority of the Kaneh was cut; a weasel bit it on (a certain portion of) the head; the stomach or small intestines were punctured;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>It fell into a fire and the innards were scorched;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the innards turned green, it is Tereifah. If they are red, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If it was trampled or hit against a wall, and was still quivering, if it was slaughtered after 24 hours (and the internal organs were checked), it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav, Shmuel and Levi):</span> To check (when a weasel bit it on the head), one puts his hand in the mouth and presses:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If brain matter exudes from the head, it is Tereifah. If not, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is like the opinion that it is Tereifah only if the inner and outer membranes of the brain was punctured.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that it is Tereifah even if only the outer membrane was punctured, how can we rely on this test? (Perhaps nothing exudes because the inner membrane is intact!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The inner membrane is soft. It would break under the pressure.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> One cannot check for a weasel's bite, because its teeth are fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this a problem? If there is a puncture, brain matter will exude!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Oshaya):</span> One cannot check because its teeth are fine and crooked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (R. Oshaya):</span> We can check, like Reish Lakish and R. Yochanan taught.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> We may check by hand (like above).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We may also check using an (iron) nail (to see if it gets caught in a crevice in the membrane).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Reish Lakish and R. Yochanan argue like the following Tana'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah would check by hand. R. Nechemyah would check with a needle.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> Through using a needle, you sometimes inadvertently create a hole (and rule that it is Tereifah), and cause a loss to the owners!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Nechemyah:</span> Checking by hand is not reliable. You sometimes permit a Nevelah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Really, it is only a Tereifah, for it was slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If a bird was bitten by a weasel, we may check it by hand, not with a nail;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the skull was broken, even if the membrane is intact, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we cannot rely on the above test (which is only for the membrane)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A broken skull is Tereifah only in birds that live in water, since they have no membrane.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Really, they have a membrane, just it is very soft.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> Do Rav and Shmuel really rely on testing by hand? Levi's Beraisa refutes them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Levi):</span> If a defect makes an animal Tereifah, it makes a bird Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A broken skull, even though the membrane is intact, is Tereifah only regarding birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A broken skull is Tereifah only in birds that live in water, since their membrane is soft.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>R. Chana's chicken had a broken skull, but the membrane was intact. Rav Masna was Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chana:</span> Levi taught that this is Tereifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Masna:</span> He referred only to birds that live in water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>Rav Shizbi would check by sunlight. Rav Yemar would check with water (he would see if water can leave through the wound. Alternatively, he would see if water put on the wound externally would whiten, which shows that it mixed with brain matter). Rav Acha bar Yakov would check with straw (the way one checks with a nail.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shizbi):</span> Our geese are considered birds that live in water.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IF THE INTESTINES WERE BURNED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it fell in a fire...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Just like a puncture of any size (in the innards) is Tereifah, also greenness of any size.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef, son of R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If the part of the liver by the innards turned green, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> It is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This should be no worse than if it was missing, but that is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If this part turned green, it indicates that the small intestines themselves were singed, so it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Levi sent a chicken to R. Elazar Hakapar b'Ribi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> It is green, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If they are green, it is Tereifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That only refers to the stomach, heart and liver, which are normally red.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Greenness is a Tereifah only in the stomach, heart and liver, which are normally red.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Avahu checked a chicken for R. Yitzchak bar Yosef. He ruled that it is Tereifah due to redness (in the small intestines.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If they are red, it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If what is normally red turns green, or vice-versa, it is Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Redness is Kosher only in the stomach, heart and liver.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Chiya):</span> If what was red turned green, and reverted to red when it was cooked, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The greenness was due to smoke. It went away during the cooking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> If red organs turned green during cooking, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This reveals that they were burned while the animal was alive.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Ashi):</span> If so, a bird that fell in a fire should not be eaten until it is cooked!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If we do not see Simanim that the innards were singed, we are not concerned for this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it was trampled or hit against a wall...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar ben Antigonus):</span> In either case, it must be checked.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DEFECTS THAT DO NOT MAKE BIRDS TEREIFAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following defects do not make a bird Tereifah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Kaneh was punctured or cracked; a weasel bit it on the head (in a place that will not kill it); the crop was punctured;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rebbi says, even if the crop was removed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The intestines came out (and were returned), but they were not punctured;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The wings or legs were broken;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The large feathers fell off;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if the small feathers fell off, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> R. Simai and R. Tzadok ruled about a removed womb, like Rebbi rules about the crop.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did they rule that a removed womb is Tereifah, and about a crop like Rebbi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Or, did they rule that a removed womb is Kosher, like Rebbi rules about the crop, but they hold that a removed crop is Tereifah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> The top of the crop is like the Veshet. (If it is punctured, it is Tereifah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> This applies from where it starts to get thin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The intestines were removed...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar R. Yitzchak):</span> This is only if they were returned the same way. If they were reversed, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Hu Ascha va'YKoNenecha" - Hash-m made bases (Kenim) in man. If they are reversed, man cannot live.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "Hu Ascha va'Ykonenecha" - Hash-m made Yisrael like a great city that has everything, i.e. Kohanim, prophets, ministers, and kings. "Mimenu Finah Mimenu Yased" (teaches that the cornerstone and bolt, i.e. the essential leaders, are from Yehudah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>A man fell from the roof. (The skin over) his stomach split, and his intestines came out. A Nochri looking on made an illusion, as if he slaughtered the man's son;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The man's anguish caused his intestines to recoil into his body without reversing. The Nochri sewed him up (and he lived.)</p></div>
