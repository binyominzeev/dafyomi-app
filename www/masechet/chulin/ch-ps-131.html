<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>PAYING FOR DAMAGE TO MATANOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If the king's officers took Reuven's grain:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they took it for money that he owed, he must take Ma'aser (from other Tevel, and give the Ma'aseros to the proper recipients. The same applies to one who eats or damages Tevel!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he did not owe anything (they merely stole it), he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That case is different, for he saves money (had they not taken his Tevel, they would have taken other money. One who damaged or even ate Tevel did not save money. He could have fasted!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven bought the innards of a cow from a butcher, Reuven gives the stomach to a Kohen, without deducting from the price;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Reuven bought by weight, he gives the stomach to a Kohen, and does not pay for its weight.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Why must he give to a Kohen? Selling it is like damaging it. We should say that there is no longer a Mitzvah to give it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When the Matanos are intact, they must be given.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Nine (of the 24) Matnos Kehunah are the property of the Kohen:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Terumah, Terumas Ma'aser, Chalah, Reishis ha'Gez, Matanos, Terumas Ma'aser of Demai, Bikurim, Keren v'Chomesh (the principal of Gezel ha'Ger and its added fifth. Rashi lists six other Matnos Kehunah that are the property of the Kohen; some pairs are counted like one, so the total is nine. Tosfos' text says seven; the Tana excludes Reishis ha'Gez, for it is permitted to Zarim, and it does not Tovel (forbid shearings before it is given). 'Keren v'Chomesh' refers to payment for Terumah eaten by a Zar, and they are counted like one.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> These are called the property of the Kohen to teach that if one eats or damages them, he must pay the Kohen!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Rather, it teaches as follows;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> These are called property of the Kohen to teach that he may buy with them slaves, land, or Tamei animals. He may use them to pay a debt or Kesuvah, or to buy a Sefer Torah (even though a Sefer Torah has no connection to food. One may not even rent it out to get money for food.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>A certain Levi used to seize Matanos (being sent to a Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav:</span> Is it not enough that we do not make him give, that he even grabs from others?!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MUST LEVIYIM GIVE MATANOS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Matanos are taken "Me'es ha'Am'.") Does Rav say that Leviyim are included in "ha'Am" (and therefore obligated to give them), or not?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they are included, why do we not take from Leviyim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they are not included, why did Rav say "is it not enough that we do not make him give"? The Torah exempts him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav is unsure whether they are included. (We do not make them give, due to the Safek.) (The following question is from a long Beraisa. The question is explained on Amud B, 3:a.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Idi bar Avin - Beraisa):</span> There are four Matnos Aniyim in a vineyard:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Peret (grapes that drop during harvesting), Olelos (deficient clusters), Shichechah (what is forgotten) and Pe'ah (a corner of the field or vineyard left unharvested).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">There are three Matnos Aniyim of grain:</span> Leket (sheaves that drop during harvesting), Shichechah and Pe'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>There are two Matanos on trees - Shichechah and Pe'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Regarding all of these, the owner has no Tovas Hana'ah (he may not choose to which poor person to give them). Even if the owner is the poorest Yisrael in the world, if he took them, we force him to give them to other Aniyim.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>We learn the four Matanos in a vineyard as follows;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Charmecha Lo Se'olel, u'Feret Karmecha Lo Selaket" teaches about Olelos and Peret.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Why did Rav not learn from this Beraisa that Leviyim are included in "ha'Am" (and must give Matanos)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses Matanos like Zero'a Lechayayim v'Kevah, but not Zero'a Lechayayim v'Kevah themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Matanos does it discuss?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It discusses Ma'aser Rishon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Levi receives Ma'aser Rishon. He need not give it to a Kohen!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Elazar ben Azaryah:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> We give Terumah to a Kohen, and Ma'aser Rishon to a Levi;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Elazar ben Azaryah says, we give Ma'aser Rishon even to a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar said only that we give it even to a Kohen. He did not say that we give it only to a Kohen!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that after Ezra fined the Leviyim (for not returning to Eretz Yisrael at the beginning of Bayis Sheni), we give it only to a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Ezra fined them so that Yisraelim will give only to Kohanim. He did not obligate Leviyim to give to Kohanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Beraisa discusses Reishis ha'Gez. (Leviyim must give it to Kohanim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The general rule is, anything with Kedushah (that is forbidden to a Zar), like Terumah, Terumas Ma'aser and Chalah, Leviyim must give to Kohanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Anything without Kedushah, like Zero'a Lechayayim v'Kevah, Leviyim need not give to Kohanim. (Rav should have learned from this Beraisa that Leviyim are not included in "ha'Am"!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses Matanos like Zero'a Lechayayim v'Kevah, namely, Ma'aser Rishon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one slaughters an animal for a Kohen or Nochri, he is exempt from Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he slaughters for a Yisrael or Levi, he must give them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. If he slaughters for a Yisrael, he must give them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If one who slaughters for a Levi is exempt, the Beraisa should (explicitly) exempt one who slaughters for a Levi or Nochri!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Beraisa):</span> If one slaughters for a Kohen or Nochri, he is exempt; if he slaughters for a Yisrael or Levi, he must give Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This refutes Rav!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> Tana'im argue about this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "V'Chiper Es Mikdash ha'Kodesh" - Avodah (on Yom Kipur) atones for transgressions of Tum'ah in the Mikdash. "Ohel Mo'ed" - (it atones for Tum'ah in) the Heichal. "Ha'Mizbe'ach" refers to the Mizbe'ach. "Yechaper" refers to the courtyards of the Mikdash. "Ha'Kohanim" teaches about the Kohanim. "Am ha'Kahal" teaches about Yisrael. "Yechaper" teaches about the Leviyim. (Leviyim are not included in "Am ha'Kahal");</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> "Yechaper" - it atones for slaves. (This Tana must hold that Leviyim are included in "ha'Kahal.")</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Rav says that the Halachah follows Tana #1, he should exempt Leviyim from Matanos. If the Halachah follows Tana #2, he should obligate them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav was unsure whom the Halachah follows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mereimar):</span> The Halachah follows Rav, and Rav Chisda (who exempts one who damages Matnos Kehunah).</p></div>
