<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHICH MEAT IS FORBIDDEN WITH MILK?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(continuation of Mishnah):</span> One who vows not to eat meat is permitted to eat meat of fish and grasshoppers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Our Mishnah holds that the Torah forbids cooking  fowl with milk. Who is the Tana?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not R. Akiva, for he holds that the Isur of Chayos or birds with milk is only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> One who vows not to eat meat is permitted meat of fish and grasshoppers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This implies that he is forbidden to eat fowl. This is like R. Akiva, who says that anything a messenger would ask about is considered the same species!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed not to eat Yerek (this word connotes certain species of vegetables), he may eat pumpkin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Akiva forbids.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If a messenger was sent to get Yerek (and didn't find any), he would say 'I found only pumpkin.' (This shows that pumpkin is not considered Yerek!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> To the contrary! He would not respond 'I only found Kitnis (legumes, e.g. peas, because Kitnis is not considered Yerek at all, but pumpkin is)'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Is the Reisha Chachamim, and the Seifa R. Akiva?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> The Mishnah is like Rebbi. He holds like R. Akiva regarding vows, and like Chachamim regarding meat and milk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The whole Mishnah is like R. Akiva;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Reisha means that one may not cook any kind of meat with milk. Some kinds are forbidden mid'Oraisa, and others, mid'Rabanan;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Only meat of fish and grasshoppers is permitted even mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A DECREE TO GUARD A DECREE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not bring cheese...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Yosef):</span> This shows that the Torah forbids (eating) fowl (cooked with) milk. If it were only a Rabbinic decree, we would not forbid putting them on the same table. That would be a decree to guard a decree!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that we do not enact a decree to guard a decree?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> A Zar (non-Kohen) may eat at the same table with a Kohen eating Chalah of Chutz la'Aretz (which is only mid'Rabanan). Such Chalah may be given to any Kohen (even an ignoramus);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">104b----------------------------------------104b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> That would be a proof if the Mishnah discussed Chalah of Chutz la'Aretz in Eretz Yisrael, where there is reason to decree, lest a Zar or a Tamei ignoramus Kohen eat mid'Oraisa Chalah (of Eretz Yisrael)l</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The only reason not to decree would be that we do not make a decree to guard a decree.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>In Chutz la'Aretz, there is no concern for any Torah Isur (regarding Chalah). There is no need to decree!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Regarding meat and milk, if we allow fowl and milk on the same table, one may come to put beef and milk on the same table, and eat them together!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes):</span> Even if the Torah forbids fowl cooked with milk, not putting them on the same table is a decree to guard a decree. The Torah permits eating them together if they are not cooked together!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We decree lest they be put together in a hot pan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even so, a Kli Sheni (it was not on the fire, but food from a pot on the fire was poured into it) cannot cook (the meat and milk together)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decree lest they be put in a Kli Rishon (it was on the fire. Such pans can cook.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE ARGUMENT ABOUT FOWL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Fowl may be put on the same table as cheese, but they may not be eaten together;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Beis Hillel say, they may not be put on the same table nor eaten together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yosi says, this is a law in which Beis Shamai are lenient and Beis Hillel are stringent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>They discuss the table on which one eats, but all permit putting them side by side on a table on which one arranges the courses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Also the first Tana says that Beis Shamai are more lenient (just like R. Yosi)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about eating. The first Tana says that all forbid eating them together, and R. Yosi says that Beis Shamai permit eating them together.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> In six laws, Beis Shamai are lenient and Beis Hillel are stringent. One is that Beis Shamai permit putting fowl and cheese on the same table, but they may not be eaten together;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, they may not be put on the same table nor eaten together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Mishnah teaches that the first Tana is R. Yosi!</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE REQUIRED SEPARATION BETWEEN MEAT AND MILK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Agra, the father-in-law of R. Aba - Beraisa):</span> Fowl and cheese may be eaten wantonly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Agra):</span> This means that one need not wash his hands or clean his mouth in between.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rav Yitzchak brei d'Rav Mesharshiya visited Rav Ashi. He ate cheese and then beef without washing his hands in between.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Onlookers:</span> Agra's Beraisa permits eating fowl and cheese wantonly. This implies that beef and cheese are forbidden (without washing)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yitzchak:</span> That applies at night. During the day, one can see that his hands are clean.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> One cleans his mouth (between meat and milk);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Beis Hillel say, he washes (Rosh - his mouth; Rambam - his hands).</p></div>
