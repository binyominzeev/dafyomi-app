<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The ribbon informs people to pray that the tree should improve;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "'Tamei, Tamei' he will call" - a Metzora announces his plight, so people will pray for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> There is a practice to hang a cluster of dates on a date tree whose dates fall down. This is like the Tana of Beraisa #1.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK OSO V'ES BENO</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE PROHIBITION OF OSO V'ES BENO</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Oso v'Es Beno (the Isur to slaughter a mother and her child on the same day) applies both in Eretz Yisrael and in Chutz La'aretz, whether or not the Mikdash stands, to Chulin and to Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a mother and her child were slaughtered on the same day, both animals are Kosher. The one who slaughtered last receives 40 lashes. (In all the cases below, the second Shochet is lashed.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If both animals were Kodshim (Korbanos) and they were slaughtered outside (the Mikdash), the first Shochet is Chayav Kares and is also lashed (for Shechutei Chutz). Both animals are forbidden (they are Pasul Korbanos);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If both were Chulin and they were slaughtered inside (the Mikdash), both are forbidden. (They are Chulin b'Azarah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If both were Kodshim and they were slaughtered inside, they are Kosher and Pasul. (The first is Kosher and the second is Pasul. We always describe the animals and their status in the order in which they were slaughtered.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If they were Chulin and Kodshim and both were slaughtered outside, they are permitted and Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If they were Kodshim and Chulin and they were slaughtered outside, the first Shochet is Chayav Kares and is lashed, they are Pasul and Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>If they were Chulin and Kodshim and both were slaughtered inside, both are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>If they were Kodshim and Chulin and they were slaughtered inside, they are Kosher and forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>If both were Chulin and they were slaughtered outside and inside, they are permitted and forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>If both were Kodshim and they were slaughtered outside and inside, the first Shochet is Chayav Kares and is lashed. Both Korbanos are Pesulim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>If both were Chulin and they were slaughtered inside and outside, they are forbidden and permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>If both were Kodshim and they were slaughtered inside and outside, they are Kosher and Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OSO V'ES BENO APPLIES TO KODSHIM AND TO KIL'AYIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that Oso v'Es Beno applies to Kodshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "An ox, sheep or goat that will give birth... (may be offered for a Korban)... v'Shor Oh Seh Oso v'Es Beno you will not slaughter on one day" teaches that Oso v'Es Beno applies to Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should learn that it applies only to Kodshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Shor" is extra. It separates the verses (to teach that Oso v'Es Beno is not limited to Kodshim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should learn that it applies only to Chulin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Shor" connects Oso v'Es Beno to the previous matter (Kodshim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If we connect it to Kodshim, we should say that it does not apply to Kil'ayim (a crossbreed, since it cannot be a Korban!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Oso v'Es Beno applies to Kil'ayim and to a Koy (a crossbreed; it will be explained below.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Oso v'Es Beno should not apply to Kil'ayim because it says "Oh Seh"!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">78b----------------------------------------78b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Wherever the Torah says "Seh", this excludes Kil'ayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> "Oh" includes Kil'ayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Oh" is not extra. Had the Torah not wrote it, we would think that one transgresses Oso v'Es Beno only if he slaughters a mother and child of cattle and of flock!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since "Beno (its child)" is singular, we would not make that mistake. (Indeed, "Oh" is extra.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Oh" is needed for the following!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Had the Torah said 'Shor v'Seh u'Veno', one might have thought that one transgresses only if he slaughters all three. "Shor Oh Seh Oso v'Es Beno" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The word "Oh" teaches that all three are not required.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, we learn this from "Oso". (Below, Chachamim and Chananyah argue about how to expound "Oso".)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim can learn like this, for they don't learn anything else from "Oso". How can Chananyah answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like R. Yonason, whenever the Torah says "and", it means "or" unless it specifically says "together";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah) Question:</span> The Torah obligates "a man who will curse his mother and father." What is the source that he is liable if he curses only one?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "his father and his mother he cursed."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yonason says, ("and") connotes both or only one, unless the Torah specifies "together".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE FATHER AND THE SON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the opinions of Chananyah and Chachamim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Oso v'Es Beno applies to a mother (and her child), but not to a father;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chananyah says, it applies to mothers and fathers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> One might have thought that Oso v'Es Beno should apply to mothers and fathers. The Torah teaches that it does not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shilu'ach ha'Kan (the Mitzvah to send away a bird sitting on its eggs or chicks before taking them) applies only to a mother, but not to a father;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Also Oso v'Es Beno applies only to mothers!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Oso v'Es Beno applies in more cases than sending the mother bird, e.g. it applies to one's own animals. Perhaps it also applies to fathers!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Oso" connotes one parent, and not both.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Once we know this, we may now learn from Shilu'ach ha'Kan. Just like that applies only to the mother, also Oso v'Es Beno.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If you prefer, you can learn from "Beno", which connotes the parent that a child follows around. This does not apply to a father.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What objection might one have to the previous explanation?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Oso" is masculine, which denotes the father.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Chananyah explains, "Oso" is masculine, which denotes the father. "Its son" denotes the parent that a child follows around, i.e. the mother. Therefore, both are included.</p></div>
