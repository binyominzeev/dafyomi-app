<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HOW TO FORCE HER TO TAKE AN OATH OF THE TORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If he is clever, he will force her to take an oath mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He pays the Kesuvah again in front of a different witness. He joins the two witnesses (so she cannot deny receiving her Kesuvah), and claims that the first payment was a loan. (Since she contradicts the witness who saw the first payment, she must swear mid'Oraisa.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> The two witnesses cannot be joined (since they saw different matters. She could contradict both of them and collect a third time!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shisha):</span> Rather, the second time, he pays her in front of the original witness and another witness. Now, he can prove that he paid once, and he claims that the first payment was a loan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> She can claim that she had two Kesuvos, and this is what he paid her! (The first witness supports her!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Rather, he must tell the witnesses why he is doing this, and that there was only one Kesuvah. (She is not believed to say that she had two Kesuvos, for this is unusual.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>GETTING PAID FROM OTHERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (When she collects) from buyers...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Also orphans collect only with an oath.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> From whom do they collect?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is from the borrower.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Their father would have collected without an oath. Must they make an oath?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Orphans who collect from orphans must swear.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Zrika):</span> This is only when the borrower's children say 'our father said that he borrowed and paid.' If they say 'our father said that he never borrowed', they do not pay.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Just the opposite! Denying the loan is admission that it was not paid! (And a document says that there was a loan!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Zrika):</span> Orphans who collect from orphans must swear, only when the borrower's children say 'our father said that he borrowed and paid.' If they say 'our father said that he never borrowed', they pay, and no oath is needed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Denying a loan is like admitting that it was not paid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who is paid up in her husband's absence must swear.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha):</span> A case occurred, and R. Yitzchak said that only a Kesuvah is paid up in the husband's absence to encourage marriage, but a loan is not paid in the borrower's absence.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Also a loan is not paid in the borrower's absence, lest borrowers take the money and go abroad. If Beis Din would not collect in such a case, people would be hesitant to lend.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>R. SHIMON'S OPINION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> (The heirs can make her swear only) when she demands payment of her Kesuvah...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which case does R. Shimon discuss?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmiyah):</span> Chachamim (86a) taught that one who is paid in her husband's absence must swear, whether she demands food or her Kesuvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon argues and says that the heirs can make her swear only when she demands her Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">88b----------------------------------------88b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon and Chachamim argue as Chanan and Bnei Kohanim Gedolim do:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1 - Chanan):</span> If a man went overseas and his wife demands food, she does not swear now, only when she will collect her Kesuvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Bnei Kohanim Gedolim say, she swears also now.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Shimon holds like Chanan; Chachamim hold like Bnei Kohanim Gedolim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> Our Mishnah says that the <i>heirs</i> make her swear. If the case is like in Mishnah #1, it should say that Beis Din makes her swear!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> Chachamim (86b) taught 'if she went from burying her husband to her father's house, or returned to her father-in-law's house, and did not become an overseer, the heirs cannot make her swear. If she became an overseer, the heirs can make her swear about the future, but not about the past.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon teaches that they can make her swear only if she claims her Kesuvah (but not for being an overseer).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They argue as Aba Sha'ul and Chachamim do:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An overseer appointed by the father must swear to the orphans. One appointed by Beis Din does not swear;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Aba Sha'ul says oppositely. An overseer appointed by Beis Din must swear. One appointed by the father does not swear.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Shimon holds like Aba Sha'ul, and Chachamim hold like Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> R. Shimon says '<i>whenever</i> she demands her Kesuvah...' (implying that he holds that they can make her swear in more cases than Chachamim). According to you, it should say <i>if</i> she demands her Kesuvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> Chachamim (86b) taught 'if he wrote 'I, my heirs, or those who come in my stead have no vow or oath on you, your heirs, or those who come in your stead', then he, his heirs, or those who come in his stead cannot impose an oath on them';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon teaches that whenever she claims her Kesuvah, they can make her swear.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They argue as Aba Sha'ul ben Eima Miryam and Chachamim do. (On 87a, Aba Sha'ul ben Eima Miryam said 'whether he wrote 'not an oath', 'clean oath'... 'from my property', or 'from these properties', neither he nor his heirs can make her swear. But what can I do? We learned that one can collect from orphans' property only if he swears!' We may infer that Chachamim argue with him (and exempt), for Rav Nachman said that the Halachah follows Aba Sha'ul.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon holds like Aba Sha'ul ben Eima Miryam, Chachamim hold like Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> This explains why R. Shimon said 'whenever she claims her Kesuvah, they can make her swear.' It does not explain why he concluded, 'if she does not claim her Kesuvah, they cannot make her swear'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Papa):</span> His concluding words come to argue with R. Eliezer and the Chachamim who argue with him. (On 86b, R. Eliezer and Chachamim hold that they can make her swear if she was an overseer, even if she does not claim her Kesuvah.)</p></div>
