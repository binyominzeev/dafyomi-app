<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IS BI'AH RISHONAH PERMITTED ON SHABBOS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(The house of Rav):</span> Rav permits this, and Shmuel forbids.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Nehardai):</span> Rav forbids and Shmuel permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> A way to remember this is that each place is lenient on themselves (each follows its teacher, and says that its teacher permits).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav forbids!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Simi bar Chizkiyah citing Rav):</span> One may not cram a piece of cloth into the opening of a barrel of beer to seal it. (This shows that Rav holds like R. Yehudah. who forbids Davar she'Eino Miskaven, i.e. squeezing from the cloth.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Stuffing the cloth will definitely squeeze;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> R. Shimon agrees that a Pesik Reisha (a case when the result will definitely happen) is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Chiya bar Ashi and R. Chiya bar Avin said that Rav rules like R. Yehudah, and Rav Chanan bar Ami said that Shmuel holds like R. Shimon!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, Rav holds like R. Yehudah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to the version that the blood is stored, he holds that one ruins the opening;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to the version that the blood is absorbed, he holds that the wound is destructive.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda - Mishnah):</span> If a girl was married below (12,) the age at which one normally sees Dam Nidah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai attribute blood seen during Bi'ah on the first four nights to her Besulim (tokens of virginity), and she remains permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel apply this leniency until the wound heals.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If she was married above this age, Beis Shamai apply the leniency the first night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Beis Hillel are lenient until Saturday night, four nights.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They permit Bi'ah on Shabbos night, even if they did not Bi'ah before!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> No, they are permitted any night except Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> 'Until Saturday night, four nights' includes Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, the Mishnah discusses when they had Bi'ah before Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what do we learn from 'until Saturday night'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It permits Bi'ah (if it is not the first) on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may enter through a narrow opening on Shabbos, even though he might make pebbles fall (off the sides, widening the opening).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A CHASAN IS EXEMPT FROM KRI'AS SHEMA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> A Chasan is exempt from Kri'as Shema the first night, until Saturday night if he has not had Bi'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He is exempt (even on Shabbos) because he is distracted because he wants to have Bi'ah (now)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> No, he is troubled that he has not had Bi'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Distress does not exempt from Kri'as Shema! If it did, one whose ship sank should be exempt!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is true!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav taught that a mourner is obliged to keep all Torah Mitzvos, except for Tefilin, since they are called "glory".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Tana'im argue about whether or not Bi'ah Rishonah is allowed on Shabbos (this Tana permits. Shmuel holds like the other Tana.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If he did not have Bi'ah on the first night, he is exempt (from Kri'as Shema) even on the second. If he did not have Bi'ah on the second night, he is exempt even on the third (which is Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> He is exempt the first two nights, and obligated on the third.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rebuttal (Abaye):</span> The authors of both Beraisos forbid Bi'ah. They argue about whether or not distress is an exemption.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rashi explains that the following is according to Rava):</span> These two Tana'im argue like the following Tana'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who marries a virgin may not have Bi'ah Rishonah on Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim permit it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are the Chachamim that permit it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They hold like R. Shimon, who permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven (in this case, wounding or making an opening).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> R. Shimon agrees that a Pesik Reisha is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Beraisa does not discuss Babylonians, who are unskilled in Hatiyah (tilting the Ever to avoid breaking the Besulim). It discusses those skilled in Hatiyah. (For them, it is not a Pesik Reisha.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they are skilled, why are they distracted?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Unskilled men are distracted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Only skilled men should be permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Most men are skilled.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava bar Rav Chanan):</span> If most men are skilled, why do we do Bi'ah Rishonah with a cloth and Shushbinin (people nearby to ensure that no one will lie about the presence of Dam Besulim? Tosfos - we ask about Shabbos, when he must do Hatiyah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Perhaps he will (have normal Bi'ah,) find blood and dispose of it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ami):</span> If one opens a scab on Shabbos with intent to make a (lasting) opening (to let out pus and let air enter), he is liable. If he wants only to remove pus, he is exempt (and we hold that it is permitted)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Pus in a scab is stored and outside the flesh. Dam Besulim is stored but partially absorbed in the flesh.</p></div>
