<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A WOMAN TAKEN FOR MONETARY REASONS (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the same applies even to one taken for ransom. The case happened to be that she was taken for collateral.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Support (for Rav Shmuel - Rava - Mishnah):</span> R. Yosi ha'Kohen and R. Zecharyah ben ha'Katzav testified about a girl who was taken for collateral for a loan in Ashkelon. Her family distanced themselves from her, even though witnesses say that she was never in seclusion;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If you believe the witnesses that she was taken for collateral, believe them that she was not secluded. If you do not believe them that she was not secluded, do not believe them that she was taken for collateral!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>She was taken for money, and she was permitted only due to the witnesses. Without witnesses, she would be forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We do not distinguish between being taken for collateral and being taken for ransom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, we distinguish. Being taken for collateral is more stringent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #3 - Question (Mishnah):</span> If she is taken for money, she is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> R. Yosi testified...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though she was taken for money, if not for the witnesses she would have been forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> When Yisrael are in control she is permitted. When Nochrim are in control, even when taken for money, she is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she was taken for a capital offense...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav):</span> An example is the wife of a thief.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Levi):</span> An example is the wife of ben Dunai (a murderer).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> This applies only when there was a verdict for death.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is even if there was no verdict.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A BESIEGED CITY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a besieged city was captured, all wives of Kohanim are forbidden to their husbands;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If they have witnesses, even a male or female slave, they are believed;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A person is not believed about himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Contradiction - Beraisa):</span> If an army entered a city in peacetime, open barrels of wine are forbidden and closed barrels are permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was wartime, both are permitted, because the soldiers have no time to pour it to idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Mari):</span> They find time to rape women (for there is a great lust for this), but not to serve idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Tosfos) Answer #2 (R. Yitzchak bar Elazar):</span> We distinguish the army of the country from an invading army. (The home army has time, but an invading army does not.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even when the home army entered, certainly one woman escaped. (Why are all forbidden?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi, according to Tosfos) (R. Yitzchak bar Elazar):</span> We distinguish the home army (it does not do any damage) from an invading army.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even when the home army entered, certainly one soldier escaped (to rape a woman. Why are all permitted?) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> There are guards that see everyone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Certainly, guards sometimes doze!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Levi):</span> The city is surrounded by iron chains, dogs, sticks, thorns and geese (it is very hard to leave, and one who tries will surely be detected).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Zavda):</span> R. Yehudah Nesi'ah and Chachamim argued about how to resolve the Mishnah and the Beraisa. One distinguished between the host army and an invading army, and had no difficulty (he was not concerned lest one escaped). The other (did not distinguish and) had difficulty, and answered that the city is surrounded by chains, etc.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A HIDING PLACE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> If there is a hiding place in the city, all wives of Kohanim are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> Is this even if it can hold only one woman?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do we say about each woman that she hid there, or not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like the case of two paths:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> There are two paths; one is Tahor and the other is Tamei. (We do not know which is which.) Reuven walked on one path and touched Taharos (Tahor Kelim or food). Shimon walked on the other path and touched Taharos. If they ask at different times, we tell each that his Taharos are Tehorim. If they ask together, we tell them that their Taharos are Temei'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, in either case their Taharos are Temei'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If they ask at the same time, all agree that their Taharos are Temei'im. If they ask at different times, all agree that the Taharos are Tehorim. They only argue when one comes to ask for himself and his friend;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yehudah equates this to asking at different times. R. Yosi equates this to asking at the same time.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Here too, we decide the law of all the women together! (The Halachah follows R. Yosi against R. Yehudah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The comparison is no good. There, one path is certainly Tamei. Here, perhaps all the women are Tehoros!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If she says that she did not hide there but she is Tehorah, is she believed?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do we believe her because she did not need to lie? (She could have claimed that she hid there, so surely she tells the truth!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, do we not say this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like when Reuven rented his donkey to Shimon and told him not to lead it near the river, since it is wet. Shimon led it by the river, and it died.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> I led it by the river, but it was dry!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> He is believed. He did not need to lie, for he could have said that he didn't lead it by the river!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> This reasoning does not override witnesses. (Rashi Bava Metzia 81b - we can testify that it was wet by the river. Teshuvas Rosh 82:1 - we know that it is usually wet.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The comparison is no good. There, (it is as if) witnesses know that it was wet. Here, we have no witnesses that she is Temei'ah. It is merely a suspicion!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We do say 'why should she lie?' to overcome a suspicion.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>CAN A SLAVE TESTIFY ABOUT HER MASTER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even a male or female slave is believed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Even her Shifchah (female slave) is believed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> (If a man divorced his wife on condition that he die from his current illness,) they may not be secluded together without witnesses. It suffices even if a male or female slave is with them, except for her Shifchah, for she is uninhibited in front of her Shifchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papi):</span> We are more lenient about a captured woman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> We believe his Shifchah, not hers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do believe her Shifchah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A person is not believed about himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Her Shifchah is believed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, her Shifchah is like herself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> Both Mishnayos discuss her Shifchah. (Normally,) her Shifchah sees and is silent;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Her Shifchah cannot be a chaperon, for we permit (seclusion) when the chaperon is silent (perhaps she will see Bi'ah and be silent);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We forbid a captive if the witness is silent. If the Shifchah testifies, she is believed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Just like her Shifchah would see the divorced couple have Bi'ah and be silent,) we should be concerned lest she lie (about a captive)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Keeping silent (when seeing her sin) is one sin. She would not do a second sin of testifying falsely, like we find in the case of Mari bar Isak:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mari's brother Ploni came after being away for a long time. He asked for half the inheritance of their father.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Mari:</span> I don't recognize you.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Mari's claim is plausible. We find that Yosef's brothers did not recognize him because he left them before he had a full beard! Ploni must bring witnesses to testify that he is Mari's brother.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Ploni:</span> I have witnesses, but they are afraid to testify because Mari is powerful.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda (to Mari):</span> Get the witnesses to testify that he is not your brother.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Mari:</span> Is this the law? The one who seeks to take money from its owner must bring proof!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> I rule thusly to you and your fellow strong-arms.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest the witnesses (fear Mari and) lie for him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They would not do a second sin, to testify falsely.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not her Shifchah can testify for her:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> We accept testimony that a captive is Tehorah from a man, woman, boy, girl, her father, mother, brother or sister, but not from her son, daughter, slave or Shifchah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> All are believed to testify for her, except herself and her husband.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Rav Papi and Rav Ashi must say that the Tana'im argue (Beraisa #1 contradicts them).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must Rav Papa say that they argue?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Beraisa #2 discusses when they speak l'Fi Tumo;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> A man was talking l'Fi Tumo in front of Rebbi, about when he and his mother were captured.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">The man:</span> When I went to draw water... or gather wood, my mind was (always) on my mother.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Based on this, Rebbi allowed her to marry a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>A WOMAN WHO BECAME FORBIDDEN TO HER HUSBAND</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Zecharyah ben ha'Katzav (a Kohen)):</span> I swear that my wife didn't leave my side from the time the invaders entered Yerushalayim until they left!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> A man cannot testify for himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> (Even though Chachamim forbade her to him,) he designated a house for her in his courtyard. She would leave before her children and enter after her children (to avoid seclusion with him).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Is this set-up acceptable for a divorced woman?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps we are lenient only for a captive. Or, perhaps there is no difference!</p></div>
