<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO SELLS TO ONE WHO OWES HIM MONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Admon):</span> If Reuven shows a document saying that Shimon owes him money and Shimon shows a document that Reuven sold him a field, Shimon can say 'if I owed you money, you should have kept the money as repayment, and not sold to me a field!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Reuven was clever to sell to him land. Now he will be able to collect his debt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Admon's law is reasonable. Why do Chachamim argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In a place where people pay for a field before the document is written, all agree that Shimon can say 'if I owed you money, you should have kept the money as repayment';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue in a place where people pay for a field after the document is written.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Admon holds that Reuven should have told witnesses why he is selling.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say that everyone has friends. Had Reuven done this, Shimon would have heard and would not have bought the field.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO LENT TO HIS CREDITOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Admon):</span> If Reuven shows a document saying that Shimon borrowed from him and Shimon shows a document that Reuven subsequently borrowed from him, Shimon can say 'if I truly owed you money, why did you borrow from me? You should have collected the debt!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, each collects what the other owes him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Nachman):</span> If Reuven and Shimon both show documents saying that the other borrowed from him, each collects what is owed to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> There is no point in paying money and returning it. Rather, each keeps his own.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>All agree that if Reuven and Shimon have the same quality land (both have Idis (top quality), or both Beinonis (medium), or both Ziburis (inferior)), each keeps what he has;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about when one has Beinonis and the other has Ziburis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Nachman holds that each collects, because he says that a creditor collects from subjective Beinonis (the borrower's middle quality land).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The one with Ziburis receives the other's Beinonis. He then pays with his Ziburis. (He need not return the Beinonis he received, since it is his Idis.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Sheshes holds that each keeps his property, because he says that a creditor collects objective Beinonis (medium quality land based on the world standard).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he would collect Beinonis, he would have to return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Nachman, why does the owner of the Ziburis collect first?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should let the owner of the Beinonis first collect Ziburis, and he can then return the Ziburis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the owner of the Ziburis was the first to demand payment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But still, they come to collect at the same time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, they argue when one has Idis and Beinonis, and the other has Ziburis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nachman holds that a creditor collects from subjective Beinonis. Rav Sheshes holds that he gets objective Beinonis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Sheshes - Mishnah):</span> Chachamim say that each collects...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman on behalf of Rav Sheshes):</span> The case is, one loan was for 10 years, and the other was for five years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When were the loans made?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the first was for 10 years, and the second for five, why would Admon say that he should have collected his loan? The collection time didn't come yet!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the first loan was for five years, and the second was for 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When was the second loan made?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the first loan was already due to be collected, Chachamim should agree to Admon that if he really owed him, he should have collected the loan!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If the first loan was not yet due, why does Admon say he should have collected it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the second loan was made on the day the first loan was due,</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim hold that a person would take a loan for one day (i.e. rather than wait to collect his loan at the end of the day). Admon holds that a person would not take a loan for one day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rami bar Chama):</span> The case is, one party died, leaving no land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His orphans collect, but a creditor cannot collect from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Mishnah says that each side collects!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, this one collects, and this one deserves to collect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah says that each collects!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rava):</span> The living creditor can pay land, and collect it again!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If orphans collect land for a debt owed to their father, a creditor of the father can collect that land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>These are left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The orphans have Ziburis, and the other party has (Idis and) Beinonis. The orphans collect Beinonis, and pay back Ziburis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if Beinonis is defined objectively, only Ziburis is collected from orphans!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is only if the creditor did not seize Beinonis. If he seized Beinonis, he keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FORCING ONE'S WIFE TO MOVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are three regions (of Eretz Yisrael) regarding marriage: Yehudah, east of the Yarden, and Galil. One cannot force his wife to move to a different region.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Within a region one can force his wife to move from one city to another, or from a large city to another large city;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">110b----------------------------------------110b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One cannot force his wife to move from a city to a big city, or vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One can force his wife to move from a bad place to a nice place, but not from a nice place to a bad place;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, one cannot force her even from a bad place to a nice place, because living in a nice place tests (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Granted, one cannot force his wife to move from a big city to a city, for everything is found in a big city, but not in a city;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why can't he force her to move from a city to a big city?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like R. Yosi bar Chanina taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> Living in a large city is hard - "They blessed all the people who volunteered to live in Yerushalayim." (It is crowded and there is little air.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'tests' mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Shmuel taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Change in one's routine brings stomach sickness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Sefer Ben Sira):</span> All days of a poor person are hard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shabbos and Yom Tov are enjoyable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel taught that a change in one's routine brings stomach sickness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Sefer Ben Sira):</span> Even nights (of a poor person are hard). His roof is lowest of the roofs, his vineyard is at the top of the hill.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rain from other roofs falls on his. The soil of his vineyard falls to others.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FORCING ONE'S HOUSEHOLD TO MOVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone can force (his household) to move to Eretz Yisrael. Anyone cannot force them to leave Eretz Yisrael. Anyone can force (his household) to move to Yerushalayim. Anyone cannot force them to leave Yerushalayim. This applies to men and women equally.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a man married a woman in Eretz Yisrael and divorced her in Eretz Yisrael, he pays the Kesuvah in coins of Eretz Yisrael. If he married her in Eretz Yisrael and divorced her in Kaputkiya, he pays the Kesuvah in coins of Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he married her in Kaputkiya, and divorced her in Eretz Yisrael, he pays the Kesuvah in coins of Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he pays coins of Kaputkiya (which are larger);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If he married her in Kaputkiya, and divorced her in Kaputkiya, he pays the Kesuvah in coins of Kaputkiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does 'anyone can force' come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It includes slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (There is an opinion that the Mishnah explicitly lists slaves.) According to this opinion, what does 'anyone' include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It includes even from a nice place to a bad place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'anyone cannot force them to leave' include?</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The master must sell the slave to one who lives in Eretz Yisrael, to promote settlement of Eretz Yisrael.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes even from a bad place to a nice place.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(This is not a Chidush, for we taught that anyone can force to go to Yerushalayim, even from a nice place to a bad place!) This is taught for parallel structure with the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he wants to go to Eretz Yisrael, and his wife does not, she must go, or else he may divorce her without paying her Kesuvah.

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he married a woman...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah contradicts itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he married her in Eretz Yisrael and divorced her in Kaputkiya, he pays the Kesuvah in coins of Eretz Yisrael. This shows that he pays coins of the place where he obligated himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he married her in Kaputkiya, and divorced her in Eretz Yisrael, he pays the Kesuvah in coins of Eretz Yisrael. This shows that he pays coins of where she collects!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The Tana holds that Kesuvah is mid'Rabanan, therefore, he is lenient to allow payment of the smaller coins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> He pays coins of Kaputkiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that Kesuvah is mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a loan document says (that it was written in) Bavel, it must be paid in coins of Bavel. If it says Eretz Yisrael, it must be paid in coins of Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the place is not written, it is paid in coins of the place of collection.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If it says only 'Kesef' - the borrower pays him whatever he wants;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This does not apply to a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which law does not apply to a Kesuvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> The first law (that it is paid in the coins of the place it was written) does not apply. The Tana does not hold like R. Shimon ben Gamliel (rather, he pays smaller coins).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If it only says 'Kesef', the borrower pays him whatever he wants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should pay him chunks of silver!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> The case is, the document says 'coins of Kesef'.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A person should live in Eretz Yisrael, even in a city that is mostly Nochrim. He should not live in Chutz la'Aretz, even in a city that is mostly Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because anyone who lives in Eretz Yisrael is like one who that has a G-d, but anyone who lives in Chutz la'Aretz is like one who does not, like it says "To give to you Eretz Kena'an, to be to you l'Eilokim."</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, anyone who lives in Chutz la'Aretz is like one who serves idolatry (Rashi (Devarim 4:28 and 28:64) - because he serves idolators or pays taxes that support idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "I was expelled from (Eretz Yisrael)... I was told to go serve idolatry" - did anyone tell David to serve idolatry?!</p>
