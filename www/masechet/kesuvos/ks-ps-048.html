<p class="dedicationbox">KESUVOS 48 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE OBLIGATION TO FEED ONE'S WIFE (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Elazar ben Yakov says, "She'erah Kesusah" - give to her clothing according to her age;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do not give to a girl clothing fitting for an older woman, nor clothing fitting for a girl to an older woman;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>"Kesusah v'Onasah" - give clothing fitting for the season;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do not give new clothing in summer, nor worn clothing in winter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> "She'erah" - he should have Bi'ah without clothing, unlike the Persians who have Bi'ah clothed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This supports Rav Huna, who said that if a man agrees to have Bi'ah only clothed, he must divorce his wife and pay a Kesuvah (if she desires).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Even the poorest Yisrael must have two flutists and a woman to arouse wailing at his wife's funeral.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The first Tana does not require this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is her family's custom to have this, the first Tana should agree!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is not her family's custom to have this, why does R. Yehudah require it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is his family's custom, but not her family's;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All agree that she rises with him (when his family's customs are greater) but does not descend (when his customs are lower). The first Tana holds that this applies only in her lifetime, but not after her death;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that she rises with him even after her death.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>FOR WHAT DO SPEND MONEY OF ONE WHO WENT AWAY?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a man went insane, Beis Din takes from his property to feed his wife and children, and for something else (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Why is this different than the following?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man went overseas and his wife demands food, Beis Din takes from his property to feed her, but not to feed his children or for something else.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> We distinguish between one who left intentionally and one who left unintentionally.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is 'something else'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is cosmetics (for his wife).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> It is Tzedakah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Rav Chisda, who says that we do not give to her cosmetics, certainly agrees that we do not give Tzedakah from his property;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Yosef, who says that we do not give Tzedakah from his property, would say that we give to her cosmetics. Her husband does not want her to become repulsive.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> If a man went overseas and his wife died, Beis Din takes from his estate to bury her, according to his honor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we bury her according to his honor, but not according to hers?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, we bury even according to his honor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This teaches that she ascends with him and does not descend, even after she dies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Masnah):</span> If one said 'if my wife dies (after me), do not bury her', we heed his words.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do his words cause his property to fall to his heirs? Even had he said nothing, this would happen (and surely, they need not bury her)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if he says 'do not bury me from my property (Rashi - rather, from Tzedakah)', we ignore his words;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He cannot benefit his children by imposing on the congregation.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ENTERING THE HUSBAND'S RESHUS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A girl is always in her father's Reshus (jurisdiction), until she enters her husband's Reshus for Nisu'in;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If her father gave her over to her husband's Sheluchim, she is in her husband's Reshus;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If the father or his Sheluchim went with her husband's Sheluchim, she is in her father's Reshus;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If her father's Sheluchim gave her to the husband's Sheluchim, she is in her husband's Reshus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does it say she is <i>always</i> in her father's Reshus?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows that our Mishnah disagrees with the original version of the Mishnah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the time that an Arus and his Arusah set for Nisu'in came and they were not married, she eats Terumah (if he is a Kohen) and is fed from his property.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>'Always' shows that our Mishnah argues.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>FOR WHAT IS SHE GIVEN OVER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If her father gave her over to the husband's Sheluchim, she is in her husband's Reshus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> She is given over for all laws, except for eating Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> She is given over even for Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Asi - Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> She is always in her father's Reshus, until she enters the Chupah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav):</span> Do not challenge a teaching based on your understanding of a Mishnah or Beraisa that can be learned differently!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Asi can say that giving her over to the Sheluchim <i>is</i> entering Chupah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> After she is given over, the husband becomes her heir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Giving her over is considered like Chupah regarding the Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it means that he inherits the Kesuvah if she dies, this is just like Shmuel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> If she remarries (after becoming widowed or divorced) her Kesuvah from the new husband is 100.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> She is given over for all laws of marriage, even Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If the father or his Sheluchim went with the husband's Sheluchim, or if she entered her courtyard with her husband to lodge, if she dies, her father inherits her. This is even if the husband has (the Metaltelim (movable objects) designated for) the Kesuvah (dowry);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the father or his Sheluchim gave her over to the husband's Sheluchim, or if she entered the husband's courtyard with him for Nisu'in, if she dies, her husband inherits her. This is even if her father has the Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This applies only to inheritance. She may not eat Terumah until Chupah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This refutes all the Amora'im (other than Shmuel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Contradictory inferences can be made from the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>'If she entered her courtyard with him to lodge' implies that Stam (unspecified), it is for Nisu'in!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>'If she entered his courtyard with him for Nisu'in' implies that Stam, it is to lodge!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The Beraisa teaches the Stam cases;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We assume that entering her courtyard is to lodge. Entering his is for Nisu'in.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>CAPITAL PUNISHMENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If her father gave her to the husband's Sheluchim and she was Mezanah, she is strangled.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ami bar Chama):</span> "To be Mezanah in her father's house" excludes this case (from stoning).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it excludes a girl that had Chupah without Bi'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava citing Ami):</span> Another verse teaches that she is not stoned after Chupah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Na'arah Besulah Me'orasah" excludes a Bogeres, a non-virgin and a Nesu'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If 'Nesu'ah' truly refers to a full Nesu'ah (after Chupah and Bi'ah), "Besulah" excludes her!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, "Me'orasah" excludes Chupah without Bi'ah.</p></div>
