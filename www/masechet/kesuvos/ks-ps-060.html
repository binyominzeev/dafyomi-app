<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RECOGNIZING THE MOTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the baby recognizes his mother...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> At what age do we say that a child recognizes his mother?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It is after three months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Answer #2 (Shmuel) It is after 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is after 50 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Simi bar Abaye):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand Rav and R. Yochanan. Some babies are faster to recognize their mothers than others;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But Shmuel should agree that a baby cannot recognize his mother after 30 days!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rami bar Yechezkel):</span> My brother Rav Yehudah cited Shmuel to say 30 days. This is incorrect. Really, Shmuel said that it depends only on when the baby recognizes her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A (divorced) woman (who did not want to nurse her baby) came in front of Shmuel. Shmuel told Rav Dimi to see if her son recognizes her. He sat her among other women, and passed her son in front of them. When the baby reached her, he was looking at her. Shmuel told her that she must nurse him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can a blind baby recognize his mother?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He recognizes her smell and (her milk's) taste.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW LONG MAY A CHILD NURSE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A child may nurse for 24 months. After this, it is like nursing from a disgusting thing;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehoshua says, he may nurse for four or five years. If he stopped nursing after 24 months and resumes, it is like nursing from a disgusting thing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps human milk is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Kal v'Chomer supports this! We are lenient about touching animals (a living animal is always Tahor), but we are stringent about their milk (of Tamei species);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We are stringent about touching people (a living Yisrael can become Tamei), all the more so we should be stringent about their milk!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (The Tamei animals are listed in Parshas Shemini, and repeated in Parshas Re'eh.) "The camel (the repetition forbids its milk)... <i>it</i> is Tamei", but milk of humans is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps human milk is permitted because milk of some animals is permitted. The blood of every animal is forbidden, so also human blood should be forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "It" is forbidden, but the blood of humans is permitted. (Rashi - perhaps the same word permits human milk and blood. Alternatively, "Zeh" permits human blood.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> It is not even a Mitzvah (mid'Rabanan) to refrain from human milk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Milk that separated from the breast (into a Kli) is permitted. Nursing (above the permitted age) is despicable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The opposite applies to blood (it is forbidden only if it separated):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If blood is on a loaf, one scrapes it off and eats the loaf;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If blood is between one's teeth, one may swallow it without concern.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> A child may nurse until four or five...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> (He may nurse) even if he can carry a bundle on his shoulder.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is the same Shi'ur (four or five, depending on how healthy he is).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Marinus):</span> A moaning child may suckle (from a goat's udder) on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because suckling is Mefarek (a derivative Melachah of Dash, i.e. extracting a food), done in an unskilled way. (Normally, one milks by hand. Suckling is forbidden only mid'Rabanan, so) Chachamim did not forbid it to one who is in pain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah follows R. Marinus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Nachum Ish Galya):</span> If a gutter pipe became clogged, (on Shabbos and the water is dripping into the house) one may covertly squash the clogging matter with his foot, without concern.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because this is an unskillful way of fixing a Kli. (Normally, it is forbidden mid'Rabanan.) Chachamim did not decree when this will cause a loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah follows Nachum Ish Galya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he ceased nursing after 24 months, he may not resume nursing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long is considered that he stopped?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 Answer (Rav Yehudah bar Chaviva, citing Shmuel):</span> It is three days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 Answer (Rav Yehudah bar Chaviva in front of Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> It is three days.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A NURSING WOMAN MAY NOT MARRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a woman was widowed during the 24 months of nursing, she may not become Mekudeshes or have Nisu'in until 24 months (lest she become pregnant and wean the baby prematurely);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, she must wait until 18 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Nasan bar Yosef says, they argue as Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel do;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai say, the Shi'ur is 24 months. Beis Hillel say, it is 18 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, I will explain these opinions:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The opinion that says 24 months (is the Shi'ur for nursing) permits to marry after 21. The opinion that says 18 months permits to marry after 15.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is because milk is not impeded until three months of pregnancy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Ukva):</span> R. Chanina permitted me to marry a nursing woman after the baby was 15 months old.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Abaye's sharecropper asked whether he may Mekadesh a nursing woman when the baby is 15 months old.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> (Yes!) Firstly, the rule is the Halachah follows R. Yehudah when he argues with R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Secondly, the Halachah follows Beis Hillel against Beis Shamai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Thirdly, Ula ruled like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Fourthly, R. Chanina permitted this to Mar Ukva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>These rulings permit Nisu'in. All the more so, Kidushin is allowed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Abaye came before Rav Yosef (his Rebbi).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Rav and Shmuel both require waiting 24 months, excluding the day of birth and the day of Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Abaye ran three Parsa'os (about 12 kilometers; some say, one Parsah in sand), but did not catch his sharecropper to retract his ruling.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Chachamim say 'Do not rule in the place of your Rebbi, even to permit eating eggs with a dairy dip.' (Aruch - this refers to eggs found inside a slaughtered chicken.) This is not (only) because it shows arrogance. Rather, he will rule incorrectly!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>I had learned this teaching of Rav and Shmuel, and still, I erred!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman gave her baby to a wet-nurse or weaned him, or he died, she may marry immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>A case occurred, and Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua were about to rule like this Beraisa. A woman told them that Rav Nachman had forbidden her to marry in such a case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Nachman permitted widows of the Exilarch's house!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different. A wet-nurse who accepted to nurse a baby of their house would not retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papi):</span> We have another source that Rav Nachman forbids!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A woman must wait three months before remarrying even in the following cases (even though it is unlikely or impossible that she is pregnant):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>She was constantly going to her father's home or was quarrelling with her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Her husband was imprisoned or overseas;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Her husband was too old to have children or sick;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>She was sterile, too old to have children, an Ailonis or a minor;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>She miscarried after her husband died;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span>Her womb was uprooted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi permits her to marry immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows decrees of R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rav Papa and Rav Huna):</span> We overlooked this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The Halachah is, if the baby died, she may marry. If she weaned him, she must wait;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> Even if he died, she must wait. If not, perhaps she will kill her baby in order to marry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Such a case occurred, and a woman choked her baby!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That woman was insane. A normal woman would not kill her baby.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OBLIGATIONS OF A NURSING WOMAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman accepted to nurse a baby, she may not nurse during this period her own or another's baby;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Even if meager food was stipulated, she must still eat well. She may not eat things bad for the milk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she may not nurse her own baby together with the first, we need not teach that she may not nurse another's baby!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that out of concern for her baby, she would nurse him (if we permitted her) even if enough milk will not remain for the first baby;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, we would permit her to nurse another's baby, for she would not nurse another baby unless more remains for the first;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Beraisa forbids even another's baby.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that if meager food was stipulated, she must still eat well. Who pays for the extra food?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> She pays for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa forbids her to eat things bad for the milk. What are these?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> They are hops, grass, small fish and earth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Even gourds and quince are bad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> Even bark and immature dates are bad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> Even Kutach (a dip made with bread and milk) and fried breaded fish are bad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some of these impede milk; others cloud it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>A child who results from Bi'ah in a millhouse will be epileptic. A child who results from Bi'ah on the ground will be long-necked;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>If she walked on the blood of a donkey, the children will be bald or have warts. (Rashi (cited in Shitah Mekubetzes) says that the following foods affect the baby if she ate them during pregnancy. Perhaps the same applies to walking on a donkey's blood.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>If she ate (or drank) mustard, cress, small fish regularly, earth, beer, or beef and wine, the child will be gluttonous, his eyes will constantly tear, his eyes will always be moving, he will be ugly; he will be black, or he will be healthy, respectively.</p>
