<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE PUNISHMENT OF MOTZI SHEM RA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> In Beraisa #2 R. Yehudah says that he is Lokeh, i.e. suffers monetarily, only if he had Bi'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would the Tana call paying money 'Lokeh'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one says 'I pledge half my Erech to Hekdesh', he pays half his Erech;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi bar Yehudah says, he is Lokeh and pays his full Erech.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he lashed?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> He is stricken by having to pay his full Erech;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is a decree due to one who pledges the Erech of half of himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Since he cannot live without half of himself, he must pay his full Erech.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He will be punished" - monetarily; "They will afflict him" - with lashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand that the punishment is monetary, like the verse continues "Me'ah Kesef";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>How do we know that 'affliction' is lashes?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> We learn "They will afflict" from "They will afflict" (regarding Ben Sorer u'Moreh), which we learn through "Ben-Ben" from "Im Bin Hakos ha'Rasha".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Lav against Motzi Shem Ra?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> "Lo Selech Rachil (do not go around like a talebearer.)"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Nasan):</span> "Guard yourself from every evil matter".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Elazar did not learn like R. Nasan, for he uses that verse like R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Pinchas ben Ya'ir):</span> "Guard yourself from every evil matter" - do not have thoughts (of women) by day, which lead to Tum'ah (nocturnal emissions) at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>R. Nasan did not learn like R. Elazar, for he uses "Lo Selech Rachil" to teach that Beis Din should not be Rach (soft) to one litigant and harsh to the other.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE HUSBAND MUST BRING THE WITNESSES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If witnesses testified for him without his request, he is not lashed and does not pay. She and the Edim Zomemim are stoned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot say that she and the witnesses are stoned!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> She or the Edim Zomemim are stoned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he requested the witnesses to testify for him, he would be punished even if he did not hire them. This is unlike R. Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> He is not liable unless he hired witnesses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> It says "Sam (putting)" regarding Motzi Shem Ra, just like regarding usury;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like there it refers to money, also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (R. Yirmiyah):</span> What is the law if he hired them for land, for less than a Perutah, or both witnesses for one Perutah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (Rav Ashi):</span> What is the law if he divorces and remarries her and is Motzi Shem Ra on the first marriage? What is the law if a Yavam is Motzi Shem Ra on his brother's marriage?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer	(to the last question - Beraisa - R. Yonah):</span> "I gave my daughter to this man" - to this man, not to a Yavam.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>IS MOTZI SHEM RA DEPENDENT ON BI'AH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the argument of R. Elazar ben Yakov and Chachamim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Motzi Shem Ra is when a man says, I found that your daughter is not a virgin. If witnesses say that she was Mezanah while married to him, her Kesuvah is 100.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If she had adultery, why does she have a Kesuvah? She is stoned!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> If witnesses say that she had adultery, she is stoned. If they say that she was Mezanah before Kidushin, her Kesuvah is 100.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If his accusation was false, he is lashed and pays 100 Sela'im, whether or not he had Bi'ah with her;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Elazar ben Yakov says, this (lashes and a fine) is only if he had Bi'ah with her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Elazar ben Yakov we understand "<i>U'Va</i> Eleha (this connotes Bi'ah)" and "I drew close to her";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim explain these verses?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He came" with accusations; "I drew close" with words.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Elazar ben Yakov we understand "I did not find Besulim in your daughter";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>How do Chachamim explain this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "I did not find witnesses who uphold the virginity of your daughter (through Hazamah of the witnesses who say that she was Mezanah)."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Elazar ben Yakov we understand "U'Forsu (they will spread) the sheet (on which they had Bi'ah, to check for Dam Besulim)";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>How do Chachamim explain this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> "They will clarify (the accusations) he put on her."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tana'im argue about how to explain "U'Forsu" like these two opinions.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "They will spread the sheet" - the witnesses for each side come, and they make the matter as clear as a new sheet;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Elazar ben Yakov says, the verse literally refers to the sheet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Rav Yakov):</span> Even though the Torah never distinguishes between Bi'ah k'Darkah and Lo k'Darkah regarding lashes or punishments, it distinguishes regarding Motzi Shem Ra. He is punished only if he had Bi'ah (even) Lo k'Darkah, and claims that she was Mezanah k'Darkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yitzchak is not like either Tana!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim obligate even if he didn't have Bi'ah with her!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar ben Yakov requires that also he had Bi'ah with her k'Darkah (to be able to claim that there were no Besulim)!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Kahana):</span> He is punished only if he had Bi'ah k'Darkah with her and claims that she was Mezanah k'Darkah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PRIVILEGES A FATHER HAS IN HIS DAUGHTER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A father has the right to be Mekadesh his daughter (and keep the money) through money, a document, or Bi'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He receives her Metzi'os and her earnings;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>He can annul her vows;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>He can receive a Get (document of divorce) from her husband (during Eirusin);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>He does <i>not</i> eat the Peiros (produce) of her property in her lifetime;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If she does Nisu'in, her husband has a privilege above what a father has; he eats the Peiros of her property in her lifetime.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Her husband is obligated to feed, redeem and bury her;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, even the poorest Yisrael must get two flutists and a woman to arouse the wailing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that he receives the Kidushin money?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "She will leave free; there is no money" - the master (of a Yisraelis slave who goes free when she becomes a Na'arah) does not receive money, but another 'master' receives money, i.e. her father (when she becomes Mekudeshes and leaves him).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps she receives the money!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The father is Mekadesh her - "I gave my daughter to this man." Surely she does not keep the money!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this applies only to a minor, who has no Yad (power of acquisition) to receive Kidushin. A Na'arah has a Yad to receive Kidushin, perhaps she can Mekadesh herself and keep the money!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Bi'N'ureha Beis Aviha" teaches that all revenue of a Na'arah goes to her father.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Huna learned that her earnings go to her father from "When a man will sell his daughter to be a slave" - just like a slave's earnings go to her master, a girl's earnings go to her father;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why couldn't he learn from "Bi'N'ureha Beis Aviha"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that "Bi'N'ureha Beis Aviha" teaches only about vows.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should say that her father gets her Kidushin money, just like he can annul her vows!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We do not learn monetary laws from non-monetary laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He receives the fine of one who rapes or seduces her. We should learn from this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We do not learn about Mamon from fines.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He receives the payments (of Mamon) for embarrassment and blemish. We should learn from them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Those are different, since they affect him. (They decreased the amount of Kidushin money he can receive for her.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> When a slave leaves her master, no money goes to the master she leaves - the implication is that in a similar case (Kidushin), money goes to the master she leaves - her father.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> These are not comparable! A slave entirely leaves her master, but an Arusah doesn't leave her father until Nisu'in!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She (partially) leaves his jurisdiction regarding vows;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The father and husband of a Na'arah Me'orasah jointly annul her vows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The father can be Mekadesh her via a document or Bi'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"She will be (Mekudeshes) to another man" equates all methods of Kidushin.</p></div>
