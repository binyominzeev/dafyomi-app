<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REASONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ula and Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah agree that she does not eat. What difference does it make what the reason is?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue in the following cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The husband accepted her, even if she has a Mum (the only concern is feeding siblings);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> The father gave her to the husband's Sheluchim, or Sheluchim of the father went with her and with the husband's Sheluchim (the only concern is a Mum).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Version #2 (Tosfos Kidushin 11a DH Kibel). The father gave her to the husband's Sheluchim <i>and</i> Sheluchim of the father went with her. (We are not concerned for a Mum, for her husband checks her first through relatives, but we are concerned lest she feed Terumah to her father's Sheluchim.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A <i>KOHEN'S</i> WIFE RECEIVES <i>TERUMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Tarfon):</span> He may give to her only Terumah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> They argue about a Kohen who married a Bas Kohen (she is used to guarding Terumah and selling it), but all agree that a Bas Yisrael receives half Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> They argue about an Arusah (who lives with her father, who can sell Terumah for her), but all agree that a Nesu'ah receives half Chulin (it is undignified for her to go out to sell).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (for both laws - Beraisa - R. Tarfon):</span> He may give to her all Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva says, he gives to her half Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This applies to a Bas Kohen Mekudeshes to a Kohen. If she is a Bas Yisrael, or Nesu'ah, all agree that she receives half Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira says, she receives two thirds Terumah and a third Chulin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehudah says, he may give to her only Terumah, and she sells it to buy Chulin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, whenever he gives Terumah, he gives double the quantity.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do R. Yehudah and R. Shimon ben Gamliel argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether (she gets 'extra' Terumah, so she can sell it <i>easily</i> at a discount (R. Shimon), or if she must toil to sell it (at the market price of Terumah to obtain the Chulin she needs (R. Yehudah)).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WOMEN WHO MUST WAIT BEFORE EATING <i>TERUMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Yavam does not permit a Shomeres Yavam to eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"<i>His </i>(a Kohen's) monetary acquisition" eats. She is the acquisition of his brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she was an Arusah for six months (... or for a full year less one day and Shomeres Yavam for one day, <i>or vice-versa</i>, she may not eat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If her husband does not permit her to eat (even if she was an Arusah almost a full year), It need not teach that (in a similar case) the Yavam does not permit her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Correct! The Mishnah taught this (a year less one day Shomeres Yavam), even though it can be learned from the previous law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This is the Mishnah Rishonah (the original version...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the Mishnah Acharonah (the revision) more stringent?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula; alternatively, Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> We are concerned lest she has a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, if Ula said this, the Mishnah Rishonah was concerned lest she share her Terumah with her siblings, and the Mishnah Acharonah is concerned for a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">58b----------------------------------------58b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if Rav Shmuel said this, this is just like he explained the Mishnah Rishonah! (Why did the law change?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether or not we rely on his relatives to check her for Mumim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Mishnah relies on this (he will not feed her until he checks her through relatives). The Mishnah Acharonah does not rely on this (until he himself checks her).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CAN A HUSBAND MAKE HIS WIFE'S EARNINGS <i>HEKDESH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Makdish his wife's earnings, she may eat what she earns (it is not Hekdesh);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, if he was Makdish her extra earnings (more than the Mishnah (64b) requires), it is Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar says, it is Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> A wife can tell her husband 'do not feed me, and I will not work for you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that the primary enactment was that she should be fed. He receives her earnings to avoid resentment;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she wants, the enactment does not apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> It was enacted that he feed her in exchange for receiving her earnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should say that the enactment was that he receives her earnings in exchange for feeding her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Huna - Mishnah):</span> If one was Makdish his wife's earnings, she may eat what she earns.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, he offers to feed her (but she declines, so he has no rights to her earnings)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the case is, he does not (have the means to) feed her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the law is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even the opinion that allows one to force his slave to work for him without feeding him, says so only about a Kena'ani slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding a Yisrael slave it says "with you" (he eats like you). All the more so, one may not take his wife's earnings unless he feeds her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the entire Mishnah was taught for the sake of the Seifa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Meir):</span> If she makes extra money, it is Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar says, it is Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rav Huna disagrees with Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> R. Meir's reason (why her extra earnings are Hekdesh) is not because he holds that one can make Hekdesh something that is not yet in the world. Rather, <i>since he can force her to work</i>, it is as if he said 'your hands are Hekdesh to their Maker'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He didn't say that!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since R. Meir holds that a person does not speak in vain (about Hekdesh), he certainly meant this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir holds that a person <i>can</i> be Makdish something not in the world!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> In the following cases, a woman becomes Mekudeshes (in the proper time):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>John was Mekadesh Lisa to take effect after he or she converts, after he or she is freed (from being a Kena'ani slave), or after her husband or her sister (John's current wife) dies, or after she does Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Even though he cannot Mekadesh her now, it takes effect when it is possible. Likewise, one may transfer ownership or be Makdish something not yet in the world, to take effect when it comes to the world!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, that Beraisa proves that R. Meir says so. Reish Lakish teaches that our Mishnah is not a proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> The extra is Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When does it become Hekdesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav and Shmuel):</span> It is Hekdesh after she dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> It is Hekdesh (even) in her lifetime.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is feeding her and giving her a Ma'ah (a coin, a sixth of a Dinar) every week for other needs, Rav and Shmuel should agree that it is Hekdesh in her lifetime!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he is not feeding her and giving a weekly Ma'ah, why does Rav Ada say that it is Hekdesh during her lifetime?</p>
