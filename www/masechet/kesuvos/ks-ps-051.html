<p class="dedicationbox">KESUVOS 51 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>FEEDING ORPHANED DAUGHTERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>An orphan and his sister came in front of Rava, who instructed that they give him (from Metaltelim) enough food for both of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> You yourself said that food, Kesuvah and Parnasah are collected only from land!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> (She will serve him to be fed.) If he wanted a slave to serve him, would we not buy one? All the more so, we are also feeding a daughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Both property that can have a lien on it (i.e. land) and property which cannot (Metaltelim) are used to feed a widow and orphan daughters;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, from land we take from sons to daughters (for food and dowries), from daughters to daughters (when there are no sons and the older daughters seized the property, we make them divide it equally, and likewise) from sons to sons, and from daughters to sons when there is much property (more than needed to feed the children until they mature);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>We do not take from daughters to sons when there is little property;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>We take Metaltelim from sons to sons, from daughters to daughters, from daughters to sons, but not from sons to daughters.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Even though we (generally) rule like Rebbi against his colleague, here the Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Elazar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Food, Kesuvah and Parnasah are collected only from land.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>EVERY WIFE MUST HAVE A KESUVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man did not write a Kesuvah to his wife, it is an enactment of Beis Din that a virgin collects 200 and a non-virgin collects 100;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he wrote that she should collect a field worth 100 in place of 200, or did not write that there is a lien on all his property to the Kesuvah, he is obligated (she has a lien and collects 200), by an enactment of Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he (a Yisrael) did not write 'if you will be captured, I will redeem you and return you to be my wife', or if a Kohen did not write 'if you will be captured, I will return you to your land', he is obligated by an enactment of Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If she is captured, he must redeem her. He may not say 'Behold, I divorce her. Here is a Get and her Kesuvah, let her redeem herself.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If she gets sick, he must heal her. He may say 'Behold that I divorce her; here is a Get and her Kesuvah, let her heal herself.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Meir, who says that if her Kesuvah is less than 200 for a virgin or 100 for a non-virgin, Bi'ah with her is considered Znus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be R. Yehudah, who permits writing 200 to a virgin or 100 to a widow, and she writes a receipt for him that she received half (even if she received nothing).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> Even if he did not write that there is a lien on all his property, he is obligated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This is like R. Yehudah, who says that Acharayos Ta'us Sofer (a loan document puts a lien on land even if it does not say so. We attribute the omission to a mistake of the scribe). R. Meir disagrees;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">51b----------------------------------------51b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one finds a loan document, if it mentions a lien on property, we do not return it, since Beis Din collects (from land that people bought from the borrower) to pay the loan (and we suspect that the loan was already paid);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the document does not mention a lien, it may be returned, since Beis Din does not collect from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim say, in either case it may not be returned, since Beis Din collects (from sold land).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Reisha R. Meir and the Seifa R. Yehudah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the whole Mishnah is like R. Meir, and he distinguishes between a Kesuvah and other documents.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He doesn't distinguish!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Five things are collected only from free (unsold) property: Peiros of and improvements made on stolen land; one who agrees to feed his wife's child; a loan document or Kesuvah that does not mention a lien.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This Beraisa is like R. Meir, who says that a loan document without a lien does not permit collecting from sold property, and it says the same about a Kesuvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The entire Mishnah is R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah permits her to write that she received half, but he must write the full amount!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The entire Mishnah is R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says that even if he didn't write a lien, he must pay, i.e. from unsold property.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A MARRIED WOMAN WHO WAS RAPED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel's father):</span> If a Yisrael's wife was raped, she is forbidden to her husband. We are concerned lest initially she was forced, but later desired the Bi'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav - Mishnah):</span> 'If you are captured... I will return you to be a wife'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Shmuel's father was silent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav:</span> "The princes held back word, they put a hand to their mouths".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What could Shmuel's father have answered?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim were lenient about a captured woman (since it is a Safek whether or not she was raped).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> The Torah permits a raped woman to her husband (this is brought below). According to Shmuel's father, what is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Witnesses say that she screamed from beginning to end.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rava disagrees with Shmuel's father.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If initially she was forced, even if she later desires, even if she says 'Leave him. If he didn't want to, I would pay him for this', she is permitted (to her husband).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is because he put the evil inclination on her (against her will).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Beraisa #1):</span> If "she was not grabbed" she is forbidden. Had she been grabbed, she would be permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is another case in which she is permitted even if she was not grabbed, i.e. she was forced in the beginning and desired in the end.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If "she was not grabbed" she is forbidden. Had she been grabbed, she would be permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is another case in which she is forbidden even if she was grabbed, i.e. a Kohen's wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing R. Yishmael):</span> If "she was not grabbed" she is forbidden. Had she been grabbed, she would be permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is another case in which she is permitted even if she was not grabbed, i.e. mistaken Kidushin. Even if her son is on her shoulder, she may do Mi'un (say that she doesn't desire him) and leave him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Women captured by robbers are permitted to their husbands.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The women supply the robbers with bread (this shows that they want to be with them)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> They do so out of fear.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> But they supply them with arrows!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> They do so out of fear;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the robbers allow the women to return to their husbands and they choose to stay with the robbers, they are certainly forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3):</span> A captive of the king is like a captive (she is permitted to her husband if he is a Yisrael). A captive of a robber is not like a captive (she is forbidden to her husband).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Another Beraisa (#4) says oppositely!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #3 permits a captive of the king, i.e. a king like Achashverosh. (She has no hope that he will marry her, so she is forced.) Beraisa #4 forbids a captive of a king like Ben Netzar (a marauder who conquered cities. Perhaps she hoped that he would marry her and had Bi'ah willingly);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beraisa #3 forbids a captive of a robber like Ben Netzar. Beraisa #4 permits a captive of a plain robber.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Beraisa #3 call Ben Netzar a robber, and Beraisa #4 calls him a king?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Compared to Achashverosh he is only a robber. Compared to regular robbers, he is a king.</p></div>
