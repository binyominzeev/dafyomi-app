<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>GIRLS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE A FINE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Arayos and Shniyos l'Arayos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If Arayos is literal (relatives forbidden mid'Oraisa) and Shniyos l'Arayos are relatives forbidden mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since Shniyos are permitted mid'Oraisa, there is a fine for them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #2:</span> Arayos are Chayavei Misos Beis Din and Shniyos l'Arayos are Chayavei Krisos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, there is a fine of Chayavei Lavin (because Kidushin is Tofsin). This is like Shimon ha'Teimani.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #2:</span> Arayos are Chayavei Misos Beis Din and Chayavei Krisos. Shniyos l'Arayos are Chayavei Lavin. This is like R. Shimon ben Menasya (who says that there is a fine only if one may marry her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> A Mema'enes does not receive a fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Other minors receive a fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Chachamim, who say that there is a fine for a minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> There is no fine for an Ailonis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like R. Meir, who says that only a Na'arah receives a fine. Since an Ailonis goes from being a minor to a Bogeres (she is never a Na'arah), she gets no fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Is the Reisha like Chachamim and the Seifa like R. Meir?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The entire Mishnah is R. Meir. He holds like R. Yehudah regarding Mi'un (that a Na'arah can do Mi'un).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa #2 - R. Meir):</span> A girl can do Mi'un until she brings two hairs (after 12 years and becomes a Na'arah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah permits until there is more black (due to hairs) than white.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The entire Mishnah is R. Yehudah. He holds like R. Meir regarding a minor (that she receives a fine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is not so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Answer #2 were correct, Yehudah would have said that the Mishnah is like R. Meir and R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Tana of Beraisa #1 holds like R. Meir regarding a minor, and like R. Yehudah regarding Mi'un.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rafram):</span> In Beraisa #1, 'Mema'enes' means one who could do Mi'un, i.e. a minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Beraisa should simply say 'a minor'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> An Ailonis does not receive a fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #3):</span> A deaf or insane girl or an Ailonis receives a fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The answer is obvious! R. Meir says that an Ailonis receives no fine (since she is never a Na'arah). Chachamim say she receives a fine when she is a minor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The one who asked this should have anticipated the answer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He brought this Beraisa in order to ask the following contradiction.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>GIRLS AGAINST WHOM THERE IS NO <i>TA'ANAS</i> <i>BESULIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (against Beraisa #3 - Beraisa #4):</span> There is no Ta'anas Besulim against the following: a deaf or insane girl, a Bogeres, or a Mukas Etz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is Ta'anas Besulim against a blind girl or an Ailonis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir says, there is no claim against a blind girl.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(Since a deaf (or insane) girl is not assumed to be a virgin, there should be no fine!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Answer (Rav Sheshes):	R. Gamliel and R. Yehoshua argue about this. (All agree that she receives a fine because she is assumed to be a virgin! R. Gamliel (12b) says that there is no Ta'anas Besulim against her, for if a healthy girl would claim that she was raped she would be believed, therefore we make this claim on behalf of a deaf girl. R. Yehoshua does not believe one who says that she was raped, therefore there is Ta'anas Besulim against a deaf girl.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know only that R. Gamliel believes her when she makes a claim. Would he believe her even when she makes no claim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! In any case like this (she does not know to make the claim), we claim this for her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #4):</span> There is no Ta'anas Besulim against a Bogeres.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav said that a Bogeres may have Bi'ah the entire first night (any blood is attributed to Dam Besulim)!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If no blood is found, he has Ta'anas Besulim. The Beraisa teaches that if he claims Pesach Pasu'ach, this is not a claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> There is no Ta'anas Besulim against a blind girl.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> This is because she falls on the ground (and loses her Besulim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> All girls fall!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If a healthy girl sees blood after falling she tells her mother (who will realize that she is a Mukas Etz). A blind girl will not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa (Sof 35b)):</span> One who was divorced due to Motzi Shem Ra does not receive a fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> She is stoned for adultery!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> It means that a girl of ill repute in her youth does not receive a fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This shows that we do not collect with a bad document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> There is a rumor that it was forged. Correspondingly, there was a rumor that she had Znus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rava taught that we are not concerned for such rumors!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Two men came and said that she asked them to have Bi'ah with her. Correspondingly, two men said that the bearer of the document asked them to forge for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The comparison is faulty! Many men would agree to Bi'ah, but we do not suspect Yisraelim of forgery!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he was trying to get a forged document, we are concerned that he forged it himself.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A REDEEMED CAPTIVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> These girls do not receive a fine:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A convert, captive or slave who converted, was redeemed or was freed above the age of three years;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, a redeemed captive retains her Kedushah (is assumed to be a virgin), even if she was above three;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One who has Bi'ah with his or his wife's daughter or granddaughter does not pay a fine, since he is Chayav Misah in Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anyone liable to die does not pay - "If there is no fatality, he will be punished monetarily".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yehudah (in our Mishnah) and R. Dosa said the same law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Dosa):</span> A woman who was taken captive may eat Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We do not disqualify her from Kehunah just because her captor pushed her around!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah):</span> Perhaps they disagree with each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah said here that she retains her Kedushah, so one who rapes or seduces her will not profit. He could hold like the Chachamim of R. Dosa, who disqualify her from Kehunah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Dosa permitted her to eat Terumah mid'Rabanan. Regarding the fine mid'Oraisa, he could hold that she does not collect it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> R. Yehudah's reason is not to prevent a sinner from profiting!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A captured girl retains her Kedushah. Even if she was 10 years old, her Kesuvah is 200.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot say that the reason is to prevent a sinner from profiting!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, we are concerned lest men (assume that she was defiled and) refrain from marrying her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah holds that she does not retain her Kedushah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen redeemed a captive, he may marry her. If he testified that she is Tehorah, he may not marry her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, in either case he may not marry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is illogical! If he can marry her when he redeems her, surely it is no worse when he also testifies to her Kedushah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When he redeems <i>and</i> testifies about her, he may marry her. If he only testifies about her, he may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>In any case, R. Yehudah contradicts his opinion in our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> Correct the Beraisa to say that R. Yehudah says, in either case he may marry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Do not change the text. R. Yehudah addresses Chachamim according to their opinion:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> I hold that in either case he may marry her. You should say that in either case he may not marry her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that a man would not waste his money. He would not redeem her if he was not sure that she is Tehorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he only testifies about her, we suspect that he merely desires her.</p>
