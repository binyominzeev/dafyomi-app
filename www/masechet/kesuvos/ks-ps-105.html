<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>JUDGES WHO MADE DECREES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There were two judges in Yerushalayim who made decrees, Admon and Chanan ben Avishalom. Chanan said two laws. Admon said seven.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a man went overseas and his wife demands food, Chanan says that she swears when she collects the Kesuvah in the end, not at the beginning;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The sons of Kohanim Gedolim said that she swears at the beginning and the end;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Dosa ben Harkinas agrees with the sons of Kohanim Gedolim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yochanan ben Zakai says, Chanan is correct. She swears only at the end.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Contradiction:</span> There were three judges of burglaries in Yerushalayim: Admon ben Gedai, Chanan ha'Mitzri, and Chanan ben Avishalom.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is a contradiction about the number of judges, and also about whether they made decrees or judged burglaries.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution - part 1 (regarding the numbers):</span> The Tana of the Mishnah listed only the most important judges (Rashi; Tosfos - the judges who taught laws in our Perek).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution - part 2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> They made decrees about burglaries;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> For cutting down a sapling, the judges who made decrees in Yerushalayim ruled that one pays two silver coins for a first year sapling, and four silver coins for a second year sapling. (Rashi explains that the Beraisa discusses an animal that cut down a tree, because 'Kitmah' is feminine. Our Gemara calls this burglary, for it knows that the same fine applies to a person who cut down a tree. Chachamim do not decree solely for unusual cases.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #1):</span> There were three judges in Yerushalayim who made decrees: Admon, Chanan, and Nachum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The Tana of Beraisa #1 is R. Nasan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> Also Nachum ha'Midi made decrees in Yerushalayim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim did not agree.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There were more judges!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Pinchas):</span> There were 394 Batei Din in Yerushalayim, and the same number of Batei Kenesiyos, Batei Medrash, and schools for children.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There were many other judges. Only these made decrees.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The judges who made decrees in Yerushalayim received stipends from the coins brought to buy Korbanos, 9900 Zuz in all. If they were unhappy with this, they received more.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Do we discuss wicked judges (who take more money than they need)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if this was not enough they received more, even if they didn't want more.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MAY JUDGES RECEIVE MONEY FOR JUDGING?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Karna used to receive a Selah from both parties when he judged a case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says, "Don't take a bribe"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that is only when a judge takes only from one party, lest it bias his judgment. Karna took from both parties, so he would be unbiased.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even a bribe to give an unbiased judgment is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Do not take a bribe" does not discuss one who intends to acquit the guilty and convict the innocent. It already says "Do not pervert judgment"!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Rather, bribes are forbidden even with intent to acquit the innocent and convict the guilty!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Karna did not take the money as a bribe, rather for wages.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even for wages, it is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one receives wages for judging, his judgments are void.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to one who takes wages for the ruling itself. Karna took compensation for what he could have earned in the time he judged.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is such compensation really permitted?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A judge who takes wages to judge is repulsive, but his ruling is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the wages are for the ruling, the ruling is void!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he takes compensation for what he could have earned. The Beraisa calls this repulsive!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is repulsive when it is unclear what he could have earned in the time. People used to pay Karna a Zuz to smell wine and evaluate it (how long it will be before it spoils), so it was clear what he could have earned in the time.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When people would come to Rav Huna for judgment, he would ask them to get someone to draw water in his stead.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE HAZARD OF BRIBES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> See how much bribes blind the eyes of those who take them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A person whose eyes hurt him pays a doctor, even though he is unsure whether or not he will cure them. One who takes a bribe of a Perutah blinds his own eyes!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Bribery blinds the eyes of Chachamim", all the more so, of fools. "And it perverts the words of Tzadikim", all the more so, of the wicked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Fools and the wicked may not be judges!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, "bribery blinds the eyes of Chachamim", even a great Chacham. If he takes a bribe, his heart will be blinded before he dies;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">105b----------------------------------------105b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"And it perverts the words of Tzadikim", even a total Tzadik. If he takes a bribe, he will become foolish before he dies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> "A king will establish the land in judgment; a man of Terumos will ravage it" - if a judge is like a king, who does not need anyone, he will establish the land. If he is like a Kohen who runs to granaries to collect Terumah, he will demolish it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Shila):</span> A judge who often borrows things may not judge.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is only if he has nothing to lend in return. If he has, there is no problem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rava often borrowed from Rebbi bar Meryon, and didn't lend to him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava only borrowed from him to elevate Rebbi bar Meryon's reputation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Torah forbids bribery, because one who receives a bribe feels close to the giver, like to himself, and a person does not see that he himself is guilty.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Shochad" (bribe) is like 'Shehu Chad (he is like one with the giver).'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> One may not judge someone he loves or someone he hates;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he loves Ploni, he will not see that Ploni is guilty;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he hates Ploni, he will not see that Ploni is innocent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If a Chacham sees that people of his city love him, this does not show that he is praiseworthy. Rather, he does not rebuke them in spiritual matters.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> I used to think that everyone in my city loved me. When I became a judge, I thought that the ones I convicted hate me, and the ones I acquitted love me.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When I saw that the same people I convict today, I acquit tomorrow, I concluded that either they all love me, or all hate me.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Do not take a bribe." Clearly, one cannot take money! The verse forbids even non-monetary bribes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Shmuel was walking on a bridge, and a man lent to him a hand. The man had a case; Shmuel disqualified himself from judging him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>A feather blew onto Ameimar's head, and a man removed it. Ameimar disqualified himself from judging his case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>Mar Ukva spit, and a man covered the spit. Mar Ukva disqualified himself from judging his case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi's sharecropper used to bring to him a basket of produce from R. Yishmael's orchard every Erev Shabbos. Once he brought it on Thursday.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Why did you bring it early?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">The sharecropper:</span> I had to come for judgment anyway.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yishmael refused to take the produce and disqualified himself from judging him. R. Yishmael got other judges to judge him. He heard the case, and kept thinking how his sharecropper should claim in order to win.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Cursed are those who take bribes! I did not take, and had I took, it would have been my own, and still, I was biased. Those who take bribes, how much the more so!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>A man who came for judgment brought the first shearings of his flock (which must be given to a Kohen) to R. Yishmael bar Elisha. When R. Yishmael heard that the man was from far away and could have given them to other Kohanim, he refused to take them and disqualified himself from judging him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yishmael got other judges to judge him; he heard the case, and kept thinking how this man should claim in order to win.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p>Ploni came for judgment and brought fish to Rav Anan. Rav Anan refused to take them and disqualified himself from judging him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Ploni:</span> You need not judge me, but take the fish, or else you will stop me from bringing Bikurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "A man brought... Bikurim (to Elisha)" - did Elisha eat Bikurim?! (He was not a Kohen. He was from Shevet Gad!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, if one gives a gift to a Chacham, it is as if he brought Bikurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Anan:</span> I was not going to accept the fish. Now, I will accept them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rav Anan sent Ploni to Rav Nachman. He enclosed a note saying that he himself could not judge him. Rav Nachman assumed that this was because they were relatives. Rav Nachman also had a case of orphans to judge.</p></div>
