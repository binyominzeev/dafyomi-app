<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Nakdimon ben Guryon gave Tzedakah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When Nakdimon ben Guryon walked to the Beis Medrash, they would spread silk garments before him, and the poor would take them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He did this for his own honor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He did not give as much as one of his wealth should give.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like people say, people load up a camel according to its strength.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Elazar bar R. Tzadok:</span> I swear, I saw her gathering barley amidst the hoof-prints of horses in Ako;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"If you do not know... go in the footsteps of the flock and graze Gediyosayich (your goats)" - we read this Geviyosayich. (If you will not observe the Torah, your bodies will need to graze (eat) from the footsteps of animals.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ONE WHO BRINGS IN GOLD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shemen bar Aba):</span> If she brings in gold, we appraise it, and he writes in the Kesuvah the appraised value.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> Gold is like Kelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Gold is like silver Kelim that depreciate (and he writes only four fifths of the appraised value).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, they are like gold Kelim that do not depreciate.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If so, it should say that they are like <i>its</i> Kelim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Beraisa #2):</span> Gold is like Kelim. Gold Dinarim are like money;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, in a place where they are not commonly changed, they are appraised, and they are (written in the Kesuvah) at their true value.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> About which law does R. Shimon comment?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He cannot comment on the latter law. The first Tana would not equate gold Dinarim to money in a place where one cannot convert the Dinarim, for one cannot spend them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He comments on the first law. The first Tana says that gold is like silver Kelim, and R. Shimon says that it is like gold coins in a place where they are not changed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to Question #2):</span> Really, R. Shimon comments on the latter law. The case is, one can spend the Dinarim with difficulty;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana says, since one can spend them, he writes in the Kesuvah a third above their value. R. Shimon says, since they can be spent only with difficulty, he writes only their value.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The entire Beraisa is like R. Shimon. It is abbreviated, and it means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Gold is like Kelim, and gold coins are like money. This applies only where they are commonly converted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Where they are not converted, they are written in the Kesuvah at their value.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Question #1 remains difficult!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (b)):</span> Beraisa #1 discusses fine pieces of gold, which depreciate. (Therefore, they are like silver Kelim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> Beraisa #1 discusses gold particles (Rashi; Tosfos - gold ore) (They/it depreciate(s).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> Perfumes of Antichi are like money (it is the main commodity there, so he writes a third above their value).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> A woman collects Parna (Tosfos - her Kesuvah; Rashi - an additional third) from camels of Arabia.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papi):</span> A woman collects Parna from garments of Bei Michsi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papi):</span> A woman collects Parna from sacks of Rodiya and ropes of Kimchoniya.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> I used to say that a woman collects her Kesuvah from a wallet full of coins in Mechuza, because women rely on them,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Once I saw that they use the money to buy land, I realized that they rely on land, so they may collect only from land.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE MINIMUM DOWRY GIVEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one marries off his daughter without stipulating, he must give at least 50 Zuz;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he stipulated that he will marry her off bare, the husband may not say 'when I bring her to my house, I will clothe her.' Rather, he clothes her while she is in her father's house;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Similarly, one (appointed over Tzedakah) who marries off an orphan girl must give at least 50 Zuz. If there is money in the wallet (this will be explained), she is given according to her honor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Abaye):</span> These 50 Zuz are simple (one eighth silver).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>We learn from the Seifa, which says that if there is money in the wallet, she is given according to her honor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rachbah):</span> The 'wallet' is the Tzedakah fund.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We would not give 50 Zuz of pure silver from Tzedakah!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE OBLIGATION OF TZEDAKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If two orphans, a boy and a girl, come to be fed, we feed the girl before the boy, for it is natural for a man to beg from door to door, but not for a woman.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">67b----------------------------------------67b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If two orphans, a boy and a girl, come to be married, we marry off the girl first, since the shame of a girl (who is single) is greater than that of a man.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If an orphan comes to get married, first we rent a house for him, supply a covered bed and all needed Kelim, then we marry him off.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Sufficient for what he lacks" refers to a house. "That is lacking" refers to a bed and table. "Lo (to him)" is a wife, like it says, "I will make Lo (for him) a helper corresponding to him".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Sufficient for what he lacks" - you are commanded to finance him, you need not make him wealthy. "That is lacking to him" - even a horse to ride on, and a slave to run in front of him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There was a poor man that was born to a rich family. Hillel bought for him a horse to ride on and a slave to run in front of him. Once, he did not find a slave to run in front of him; Hillel ran three Mil (about three kilometers) in front of him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in the upper Galil, in which a man born to a rich family became poor. They bought for him one Litra of meat each day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is so special about that?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> It was a Litra of fowl (which is expensive).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They bought meat <i>with</i> a Litra of coins.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> He lived in a small village. Every day they slaughtered an animal for him (even though much of the remaining meat would be wasted).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>A man came in front of R. Nechemyah (and requested food).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Nechemyah:</span> What do you normally eat?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">The man:</span> I eat fat meat and old wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Nechemyah:</span> I have lentils. Do you want to eat with me?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The man ate some of the lentils and died.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Nechemyah:</span> Woe to him, that I killed him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Nechemyah should lament over himself, that he killed him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The man was at fault for making himself so finicky.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>A man came in front of Rava.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> What do you normally eat?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">The man:</span> I eat fattened hens and old wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> You should be concerned for imposing on the money of the congregation!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">The man:</span> Do I eat from them?! I eat from Hash-m!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "The eyes of all hope to You, and You give to them their food in his time" - it does not say in <i>their</i> time, rather in <i>his</i> time, teaching that Hash-m gives each one his food in his time.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>In the meantime, Rava's sister came. He had not seen her for 13 years. She brought with her a fatted hen and old wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I have spoken too much. Come and eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a person lacks and does not want to receive Tzedakah, we give to him for a loan, and later for a gift;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Chachamim say, we give him a gift, and later a loan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The case is that he will not take a gift!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We offer to him a gift.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - continuation):</span> If he has money but refuses to spend it and starves himself because he wants to be supported by Tzedakah, we give him a gift and later collect it from him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he will not take again!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> We collect it only after he dies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - continuation - R. Shimon):</span> We are not responsible for one who has money and will not spend it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>If he does not have and does not want to take, we say 'give to us a security and we will lend to you' to assuage his mind.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Lend" refers to one who lacks and does not want to receive Tzedakah. We give to him a loan, and later, a gift;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"You will lend to him" refers to one who has, but will not spend it, because he wants to receive Tzedakah. We give to him for a gift, and collect from him after he dies;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, we are not responsible for such a person.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what do we learn from the repetition "Lend, you will lend him"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah speaks as people do. (It is normal to double the verb. We do not expound this.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>HOW SOME CHACHAMIM GAVE TZEDAKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There was a poor man in Mar Ukva's neighborhood. Each day, Mar Ukva used to throw four Zuz into the hole where the pivot-hinge of the door swings.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One day, the man decided to see who was giving him the money. That day, Mar Ukva was late returning from the Beis Medrash; his wife accompanied him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When the man saw that they were approaching the door, he ran after them. They fled, and entered an oven from which the coals had been swept.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Mar Ukva's feet were getting burnt. His wife (whose feet were fine) told him to put his feet on hers. He was troubled (that he did not merit a miracle like she did).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">His wife:</span> I am home all day (to give to the poor). Also, I give food, which they can enjoy immediately.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they go to such extremes so that the poor man should not see them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer: (Mar Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> It is better for a person to allow people to put him in a furnace, than to make someone blush.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn from Tamar - "She was being taken out (to be burned, yet she did not defend herself, because it would have embarrassed Yehudah)".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Mar Ukva used to give 400 Zuz to a particular poor person every Erev Yom Kipur. Once, he sent the money with his son.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">His son:</span> He does not need the money!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Mar Ukva:</span> What did you see?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">His son:</span> They were scenting the house by sprinkling old wine on the floor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Mar Ukva:</span> I didn't know that they were so delicate!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Mar Ukva sent double the amount he used to send.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>When Mar Ukva was dying, he asked to see his Tzedakah records. He saw that he had given 7000 Si'anki Dinarim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Mar Ukva:</span> I have sparse provisions for a long journey!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He gave half his money to Tzedakah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Ila'a taught that in Usha they enacted that one should not give more than a fifth of his money to Tzedakah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That applies only during his life, lest he come to need. This is not a concern when he dies!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Aba used to wrap coins in a garment and throw them behind him. He would go where the poor were, and watch that tricksters should not take the money for themselves.</p></div>
