<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FEEDING A WIFE WHOSE HUSBAND IS AWAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who went overseas...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We allot food to a woman whose husband is away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We do not allot food to a woman whose husband is away.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> Rav agrees that we do not allot food in the first three months, since a man does not leave his house empty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If we heard that the husband died, all agree that we allot food. They argue about when we did not hear that he died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav says that we allot food, since he is obligated to feed his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Shmuel disagree?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zevid):</span> We are concerned lest he left money for her food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> We are concerned lest she accepted to feed herself from her earnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>These opinions argue about an adult wife whose earnings do not suffice to feed herself. (Rav Papa holds that Shmuel agrees that we feed her. She would not consent to feed herself.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They also argue about a minor whose earnings suffice for her food (Rav Zevid holds that Shmuel agrees that we feed her. A man would not leave money with a minor.) (The following seven questions are against Shmuel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Mishnah - Chanan):</span> If a man went overseas and his wife requests food, she swears only at the end;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The sons of Kohanim Gedolim say that she swears also at the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They only argue about the oath, but all agree that she is fed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The case is, we heard that he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Beraisa):</span> If a man went overseas and his wife requests food, the sons of Kohanim Gedolim say that she swears;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chanan says, she does not swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he came and said that he left her money for food, he is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> Here also, we heard that he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says 'if he came... ' This shows that he did not die!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We heard that he died. It was a false report.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Beraisa):</span> If a man went overseas and his wife requests food, if he comes, he may say that she should pay for her for food with her earnings;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Beis Din allotted food for her, this stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> Here also, we heard that he died.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OTHER ATTEMPTS TO REFUTE SHMUEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #4 (Beraisa):</span> If a man went overseas and his wife requests food, Beis Din takes from his property to feed his wife, but not his sons and daughters, and not another matter (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> The case is, he appointed someone to feed his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, his children should also be fed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He appointed someone to feed his wife, but not his children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Tana did not specify. Why should we assume that this is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, one witness said that he died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since she may remarry based on one witness, she also receives food;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since his children do not inherit his property based on one witness, they are not fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the 'other matter'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is Cosmetics.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> It is Tzedakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Chisda says that we do not give to her for cosmetics. All the more so, we do not give Tzedakah from his money!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">107b----------------------------------------107b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Yosef says that we do not give Tzedakah from his money, but we do give to her for cosmetics, for he does not want his wife to become repulsive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #5 (Mishnah):</span> The first three months after a woman falls to Yibum, she is fed from her husband. After this, she is not fed from her husband, and not from the Yavam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Beis Din told him to do Yibum or Chalitzah and he fled, she is fed from the Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This does not oppose Shmuel. According to either explanation, there is no concern here!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Yavam does not care for the Yevamah so much that he would leave money for her food;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Yavam is not entitled to her earnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #6 (Beraisa):</span> If a woman went with her husband overseas and returned and said that he died, she chooses to receive food or her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she says that he divorced her, she is fed, up to the value of her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, we heard that he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does she receive only up to the value of her Kesuvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since she said that she was divorced, she admitted that she does not deserve more than this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question #7 (Beraisa) Question:</span> In what case was it taught that a Mema'enes does not receive food?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be when she is still married, for then he must feed her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, her husband went overseas. She borrowed money for food, and then did Mi'un.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had she not done Mi'un, he would have to pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This does not oppose Shmuel. According to either explanation, there is no concern here!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A man does not leave money (for food) with a minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A minor would not consent to feed herself from her earnings. (Normally, she does not earn enough.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE FINAL RULING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the final ruling?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Dimi):</span> Cases arose, and Rebbi ruled that she is fed, and R. Yishmael ruled that she is not fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yochanan):</span> How could R. Yishmael say that she is not fed?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The sons of Kohanim Gedolim argue with Chanan only about the oath, but all agree that she is fed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shemen bar Aba):</span> Shmuel already answered this. The case is, we heard that he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan did not accept the answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravin):</span> Cases arose, and Rebbi ruled that she is not fed, and R. Yishmael ruled that she is fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yochanan challenged Rebbi's opinion like above. Rav Shemen bar Aba gave Shmuel's answer, but R. Yochanan did not accept it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Halachah follows Rav. She is fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Halachah follows Rav Huna;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> A woman may tell her husband 'do not feed me, and I will keep my earnings.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Halachah follows Rav Zevid regarding glazed pottery:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zevid):</span> If Glazed pottery is white or black, it does not become forbidden due to absorptions. If it is green, it becomes forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they have cracks, even black and white Kelim become forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE WHO FEEDS ANOTHER MAN'S WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chanan):</span> If David went overseas and Reuven fed David's wife, he is not reimbursed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The sons of Kohanim Gedolim say that he swears how much he spent, and he is reimbursed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Dosa ben Harkinas agrees with the sons of Kohanim Gedolim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yochanan ben Zakai holds like Chanan. Reuven threw away his money.</p>
