<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO OBLIGATES HIMSELF WITH A DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it discusses a document of committal (signed by witnesses. The Chidush is that no acquisition is needed), like Rav Gidal taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Yakov agreed to marry his son to Moshe's daughter, each father agreed to give a certain amount to his child, and the children became Mekudeshos right then, the verbal promises are binding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven has a firstborn son to redeem and he wrote to a Kohen 'I owe you five Sela'im' he must pay him, and his son is not redeemed (This shows that the document obligates him!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That case is different, since the Torah obligated him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did he bother writing a document?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It clarifies to which Kohen he will give the redemption money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why isn't his son redeemed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Ula taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Mid'Oraisa, his son is redeemed when he gives the money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim said that he is not redeemed, lest people say that one can redeem with documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rava):</span> R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish argue like the following Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it is written 'Ploni is an Arev' below the signatures on a document (and Ploni agree to this), the lender may collect from Ploni's Bnei Chorin, but not from property he sold;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A case came in front of R. Yishmael. He authorized collection from Ploni's Bnei Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Ben Nanas:</span> He cannot even collect from Bnei Chorin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yishmael):</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ben Nanas):</span> Ploni saw the lender choking the borrower. He told him 'leave him, and I will give you.' Ploni is exempt, since the money was not lent on expectation to collect from Ploni.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yochanan holds like R. Yishmael, and Reish Lakish holds like Ben Nanas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Granted, R. Yochanan cannot hold like Ben Nanas;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">102b----------------------------------------102b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, Reish Lakish can hold like R. Yishmael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yishmael obligates a guarantor to pay, for the Torah obligates guarantors. He could agree that one who obligates himself through an unsigned document is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>AN ACQUISITION THROUGH WORDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Yakov agreed to marry his son to Moshe's daughter, each father agreed to give a certain amount to his child, and the children became Mekudeshos right then, the verbal promises are binding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Logically, this is only when Moshe's daughter is a Na'arah, and Moshe benefits (he gets the Kidushin money), but not if she is a Bogeres.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, I swear that Rav said this even regarding a Bogeres. This shows that Reuven's promise is binding, even though he gets no benefit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We must say that through the happiness that they are marrying their children to each other, they decide absolutely to give like they promised, and this is binding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Are these promises destined to be written in a document? (Rashi - if they are written, may the recipient collect from land sold afterwards? Tosfos (DH Nisnu) - must witnesses consult the parties before writing a document? Tosfos (DH Hacha) - are these promises binding even if a document is not written?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> They are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Clever men would write 'I will feed your daughter for five years as long as you are with me'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was said. It was not written.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would the Tana say 'They write' if they only say it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! The following is an example.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one wrote to his wife 'I have no claim to your property...'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya's Beraisa):</span> The case is, he said this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Documents of Kidushin and marriage may be written only if both parties agree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If they agree, they may be written.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'Documents of Kidushin' refers to documents of committal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. It literally means documents of Kidushin, like Rav Papa and Rav Sharbiya;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava and Ravina):</span> If a document of Kidushin was written in order to be Mekadesh Leah, without her consent, it is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa and Rav Sharbiya):</span> It is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If the husbands die, their daughters are fed from Bnei Chorin, and Leah's daughter Dinah is fed even from sold property, since she is like a creditor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the commitment was acquired through Chalipin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, also their daughters should be fed from sold property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The acquisition was made only for Dinah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Tana discusses such a case, why didn't he specify? Why should we assume that each man acquired only for Dinah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Since Dinah was alive when he commits himself, acquisition helps for her. His daughters (that he will have from Leah) were not yet born (when they married her), so acquisition would not help for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Doesn't the Mishnah include the case when his daughters were already born, i.e., he divorced Leah and now remarries her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Dinah is not fed by an enactment of Beis Din, so an acquisition helps for her. His daughters are fed by an enactment of Beis Din, so an acquisition does not help for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is illogical. Why should the enactment of Beis Din weaken his daughters?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, his daughters cannot collect from sold property because we are concerned lest he set aside money for their food, because they are fed by an enactment of Beis Din (and he wants to ensure that he fulfills it).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHO RAISES A DAUGHTER?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The first husband cannot say... (he sends her food to where her mother is).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This teaches that a daughter is raised by her mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the Mishnah discusses (even) an adult? Perhaps it discusses (only) a minor, and it is due to the incident that occurred!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man died leaving a minor son and the father's heirs and the child's mother both want to raise him, we let her raise him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A case occurred (in which he was left by the father's heirs) and they slaughtered him (so his inheritance will not reduce their shares. Here also, we are concerned lest the father's heirs kill a minor daughter lest her Parnasah reduce their inheritance!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the Mishnah should have said that he sends food to where she is.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it says 'to where her mother is' to teach that a daughter, minor or adult, is by her mother.</p>
