<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHY THE FIRST BI'AH MAY NOT BE ON SATURDAY NIGHT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> He will make calculations for the feast on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> On Shabbos, one may make calculations for a Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Chisda and Rav Hamnuna said so explicitly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> We may apportion Tzedakah to the poor on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov):</span> We go to Batei Kenesiyos and Batei Midrashos to oversee communal concerns on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Idi):</span> We oversee mortal issues on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> We go to theaters and stadiums to oversee communal concerns on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(R. Menasya):</span> One may arrange Kidushin for his daughter and contract teachers (for Torah and a trade) for his son on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Zeira):</span> This is a decree lest one slaughter a small bird on Shabbos (in preparation for the feast).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, we should not allow Yom Kipur to fall on Monday, lest one slaughter a small bird on Shabbos (in preparation for the festive meal of Erev Yom Kipur)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We are concerned only when one is busy preparing a meal for others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The meal for the Chupah is right after Shabbos. The meal of Erev Yom Kipur is the following day, so he is not rushed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This same concern also explains why the first Bi'ah may not be on Shabbos night. (We need not say like we said above that the concern is wounding.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE PROPER TIME FOR BI'AH RISHONAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A virgin is married on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May they have Bi'ah that day?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Are we confident that if he finds that she is not a virgin, his anger will not subside so quickly, and he will go to Beis Din the next day?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, are we concerned lest he will calm down quickly, and therefore require that they postpone Bi'ah until the evening?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The following shows that the former is correct:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Bar Kapara):</span> A virgin is married on Wednesday and they have Bi'ah at night, because the Berachah to fish was given on Thursday;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A non-virgin is married on Thursday and they have Bi'ah at night, because the Berachah to man was said on Friday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This shows that the only concern is the Berachah, not that his anger will subside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Berachah to fish is so important, a non-virgin should also have Bi'ah on Wednesday!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Berachah to man is preferable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> A non-virgin is married on Thursday, and Bi'ah is at night, so that the Chasan will spend three days with her before he returns to his work.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Bi'ah was by day the fondness would pass sooner, and he might go to work the next day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need both answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is no concern lest he go to his job the next day if he man is idle, or if Yom Tov falls on Friday.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AGADIC TEACHINGS OF BAR KAPARA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Bar Kapara):</span> The deeds of Tzadikim are greater than the creation of Shamayim and earth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A verse says that one hand of Hash-m made earth and one hand made Heaven, but the Mikdash is called the work of both hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya):</span> "His hands formed the dry land"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (We read "hands", but) it is written "hand".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Yotzru" (<i>they</i> formed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> His fingers formed the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We find that the moon and stars are called the work of His fingers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "The firmament tells the work of His <i>hands</i>"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The firmament recounts the work of the hands of Tzadikim (which is the work of His hands);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refers to rain (for which Tzadikim pray).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Bar Kapara):</span> "You should have a shovel with <i>Azenecha</i> (your weapons)" - we can read this like Oznecha (your ears), to teach that one should stick his finger in his ear if he hears something improper.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> Why do man's fingers resemble pegs?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He asks why the fingers are separate from each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We learned that each has its own purpose (even for Avodah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The pinkie is the measure of the Choshen (breastplate of the Kohen Gadol).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The ring finger is used to take a handful (of incense or a Minchah).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>The middle finger is needed to define an Amah (from its end until the elbow). The Amah is used in the Mishkan, the Beis ha'Mikdash and their Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>The index finger is used to drop blood of a Chatas on the corners of the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>The thumb is where we pour blood and oil on a Metzora; or, it evens out the handful of incense or flour.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Clarification:</span> He asks why fingers are slanted like pegs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one hears something improper, he can stick his fingers in his ears.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> The ear is hard but the lobe is soft, so if one hears improper things he can fold the lobe over the ear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should not let his ears here idle words, for they are the first limbs to be singed (in Gehinom).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MAY ONE HAVE BI'AH RISHONAH ON SHABBOS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a woman's first Bi'ah permitted on Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Is (virginal) blood stored up (and Bi'ah creates an opening that allows it to leave), or is it absorbed (in the walls of the womb, and it comes due to a wound made by Bi'ah Rishonah, so this is forbidden on Shabbos)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question #2:</span> If it is stored, does a man want the blood (this is not forbidden), or does he want to create an opening (which is forbidden)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If he wants the blood and he is not concerned about the opening, does the Halachah follow R. Shimon, who permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven (something unintended, but it might occur) or R. Yehudah, who forbids it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> If the Halachah follows R. Yehudah, do we say that making an opening is destructive (and permitted) or constructive (and forbidden)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question #2:</span> If the blood is absorbed, does a man want the blood (and Bi'ah is forbidden), or does he intend for his own pleasure (and Bi'ah is allowed)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If he intends for his own pleasure and the blood comes by itself, does the Halachah follow R. Yehudah, who forbids Davar she'Eino Miskaven, or R. Shimon, who permits it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> If the Halachah follows R. Yehudah, is the wound destructive (and permitted) or constructive (and forbidden)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #5:</span> If it is destructive, does the Halachah follow R. Yehudah who permits this, or R. Shimon who forbids?</p>
