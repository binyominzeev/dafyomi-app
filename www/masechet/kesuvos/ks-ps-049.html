<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IS MARRIAGE REVERSIBLE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If she returns to her father's house (after she was given to her husband's Sheluchim), perhaps she reverts to be an Arusah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rejection (Rava - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael) Question: "The vow of a widow or divorcee will stand" - this is obvious! She is not in the Reshus of her father, nor her husband (so no one can annul it)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse discusses one who was given to the husband's Sheluchim, and was widowed or divorced on the way.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is she considered to be in her father's house, or in her husband's?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Her vow will stand" teaches that (her father cannot annul, for) she does not return to her father's house.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> A Mishnah teaches the law of the Beraisa (48b 5:a, that once she was given to the husband's Sheluchim she is not stoned):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is stoned only for a Na'arah Besulah Me'orasah in her father's house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Na'arah Besulah Me'orasah excludes a Bogeres, a non-virgin and a Nesu'ah. Why does it say 'in her father's house'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This excludes one who was given to the husband's Sheluchim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Another Mishnah (Sanhedrin 89a) also teaches this:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman entered her husband's Reshus for Nisu'in, even though there was no Bi'ah, if someone else has Bi'ah with her he is strangled.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>She only 'entered the husband's Reshus' (i.e. without Chupah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A MAN'S OBLIGATION TO FEED HIS CHILDREN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> A man is not obligated to feed his daughter;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A provision of the Kesuvah is that 'the sons inherit and the daughters are fed.' Just like the sons inherit only after the father dies, the daughters are fed only after his death.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> He is not obligated to feed his <i>daughter</i>, but must feed his son. Also, there is no <i>obligation</i> to feed her, but there is a Mitzvah to feed her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah is not like any Tana in the following Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> It is a Mitzvah to feed one's daughters, and all the more so one's sons, since they engage in Torah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it is a Mitzvah to feed one's sons and all the more so one's daughters, to prevent their disgrace;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yochanan ben Berokah says, it is an obligation to feed the daughters after the father dies. In his lifetime, neither sons nor daughters are fed.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Mishnah is not like R. Meir or R. Yehudah. They say it is a Mitzvah (not an obligation) to feed sons!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It is not like R. Yochanan ben Berokah. He says there is no Mitzvah to feed either!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah can be like R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A man is not obligated to feed his daughter. The same applies to his son. There is a Mitzvah to feed his daughter, and all the more so his son.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Mishnah discussed the daughter to teach that even regarding a daughter, (there is no obligation, but) there is a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah can be like R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A man is not obligated to feed his daughter, and all the more so his son. There is a Mitzvah to feed his son, all the more so his daughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Mishnah discussed the daughter, to teach that even regarding a daughter, there is no obligation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Mishnah can be like R. Yochanan ben Berokah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A man is not obligated to feed his daughter. The same applies to his son. There is not even a Mitzvah to feed them.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since the Seifa says that there is an obligation to feed a daughter after the father dies, the Reisha said that there is no obligation during his lifetime.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ila'a citing Reish Lakish citing R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> In Usha it was enacted that a man feed his children while they are small.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the Halachah follow this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When such cases came in front of Rav Yehudah, he would say that 'a serpent had a child, and is throwing (responsibility for feeding) it on the city.' (Ran - he would not force the father to feed them. This shows that the Halachah does not follow R. Ila'a. It seems that the Rambam disagrees. He says that there is an enactment to feed children.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>When such cases came in front of Rav Chisda, he would command to make him publicly declare about himself 'a raven wants children, but this man does not.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A raven does not feed its children - "To young ravens that cry for food"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It does not feed its children when they are white, but it feeds them when they are black.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>When such cases came in front of Rava, he would ask 'Do you want that they should be fed from Tzedakah?'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>This is if the father is not rich. If he is, we force him to feed them (just like we force him to give Tzedakah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rava forced Rav Nasan bar Ami to give 400 Zuz to Tzedakah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ONE WHO GAVE HIS PROPERTY TO HIS CHILDREN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ila'a citing Reish Lakish):</span> In Usha they enacted that if one gave all his property to his children, he and his wife are fed from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Zeira):</span> We learned a bigger Chidush, that a widow is fed from his property (in the case below). We need not hear that he and his wife are fed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> If a man died and left a widow and a daughter, the widow is fed from his property, even if the daughter remarried. (A husband is like one who bought his wife's property. Normally, we do not take property from buyers to feed a widow. Here we do, since he did not pay for it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina's nephew):</span> A case occurred in which the daughter died. They ruled that the widow is fed from the property (that her son-in-law inherited).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must hear that he and his wife are fed. One might have thought that a widow is fed because there is no one to fend for her, but the husband can fend for himself and his wife!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the Halachah follow R. Ila'a?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chanina saw a man kiss R. Yochanan's feet. He had written his property to his sons, and R. Yochanan coerced the sons to feed him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If letter of the law says that the son need not feed him, we understand why he needed to coerce them (Rashi - and therefore the man was so thankful);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But if the sons must feed him, why does it say that he coerced them (verbally? He should have beaten them until they complied! - R. Tam)</p></div>
