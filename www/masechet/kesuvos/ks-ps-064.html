<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO KEEPS THE <i>BALA'OS</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ameimar, Mar Zutra, and Rav Ashi):</span> One who rebels does not forfeit the Bala'os of property that she had brought into the marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Gamda):</span> Do you pervert the ruling against Rav Zvid because he is a great Chacham (and out of humility he will not protest)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> Rava never resolved whether or not she forfeits the Bala'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, we do not take from her what she seized. We do not give to her what she did not seize!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>She waits 12 months before he gives to her a Get. During this time, he does not feed her.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A <i>SHOMERES</i> <i>YAVAM</i> WHO REBELLED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We write a document of rebellion against an Arusah, but not against a Shomeres Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> (The law of rebellion applies) whether she is Arusah or Nesu'ah, even if she is Nidah, sick, or a Shomeres Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> When the Yavam demands to do Yibum, we write. When she demands, we do not write;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel discusses when she demands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, Shmuel should have said that we write <i>for</i> an Arusah, (but not <i>for</i> a Shomeres Yavam)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps that is indeed what Shmuel said.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Presumably, we don't write for a Shomeres Yavam because she is not commanded to have children. The same applies to an Arusah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We write for an Arusah who wants children to uphold her in her old age and to bury her when she dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A Yevamah can also claim this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> In both cases the Yavam demands. In the Beraisa, he demands to do Chalitzah (and she wants to do Yibum). Shmuel discusses a Yavam who demands to do Yibum (and she wants to do Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This is like R. Pedas, who says that we accept a demand to do Chalitzah (and write an Igeres Mered against her), but not a demand to do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we distinguish?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he demands to do Yibum, we tell him to marry someone else. We should say the same when he demands to do Chalitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He can say that people will not give to me (their daughters to marry) as long as I have a Shomeres Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He can say this also when he demands Yibum! (Tosfos - he does not want to do Chalitzah, for then she collects her Kesuvah from his brother's property. Alternatively, she does not want to do Yibum or Chalitzah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> In both cases, he demands to do Yibum. The Beraisa is like the initial Mishnah, and Shmuel is like the latter version:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> At first, when people intended for the Mitzvah of Yibum, this was preferable to Chalitzah. Nowadays that people do not intend for the Mitzvah, Chachamim say that Chalitzah is preferred.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW MUCH WE REDUCE OR ADD TO THE <i>KESUVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> We deduct seven Tarpa'ikin every week.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is a Tarpa'ika?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> It is one Istira.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is an Istira?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is half a Zuz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Three Tarpa'ikin are nine Ma'in. This is one and a half Ma'in per day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Yosef):</span> When she rebels, we deduct from her Kesuvah corresponding to all seven days of the week, including Shabbos. When he rebels, why do we add to her Kesuvah only for six weekdays, but not for Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> When we subtract from her Kesuvah it does not look like wages, so we subtract even for Shabbos. Adding to her Kesuvah looks like wages, so we do not do so for Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">64b----------------------------------------64b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Yosef):</span> Why is a wife who rebels punished more than a husband who rebels?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> We find that men hire women for harlotry (and not vice-versa, for men desire Bi'ah more).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> No one sees a woman's desire. A man's desire is perceptible (an erection, which is disgraceful).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MINIMAL RATIONS ONE MUST SUPPLY TO HIS WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who feeds his wife through an intermediary must supply at least this much every week:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Two Kabim of wheat, or four Kabim of barley;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, only R. Yishmael allots barley, for he lived close to Edom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A half Kav of Kitnis (pulse, a kind of legume) and half a <i>Log</i> of oil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A Kav of dried figs, or a Maneh of pressed figs;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he cannot give these, he gives other fruits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He provides her with a bed, mat and mattress;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He gives to her a kerchief for her head and a belt. He gives to her shoes every festival;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>He gives to her clothing worth 50 Zuz each year. He does not give new clothing in summer, nor worn clothing in winter. Rather, he gives 50 Zuz worth of new clothing in winter, and she wears the remnants in summer, and the remnants are hers;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>He gives to her a silver Ma'ah each week for her needs;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>She eats with him every Shabbos night;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If he does not give to her a Ma'ah each week, she keeps her (excess) earnings;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Each week, she must spin Shesi (lengthwise) threads (of wool) weighing five Sela'im of Yehudah, which equals 10 Sela'im of Galil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, she can spin 10 Yehudah-Sela'im of Arev (widthwise) threads, which equals 20 Galil-Sela'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If she was nursing, her workload is reduced and her rations are increased;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This all applies to the poorest man in Yisrael. Each man must increase according to his standing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Mishnah is unlike R. Yochanan ben Berokah, and unlike R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> How much bread is two meals (for Eruv Techumim)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Meir):</span> It is the amount one eats in two weekday meals;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> It is based on two Shabbos meals.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Both intend to be lenient. (R. Meir holds that on Shabbos one eats more bread to accompany the other foods. R. Yehudah holds that on Shabbos one eats less bread for he is satiated by the other foods.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan ben Berokah):</span> It is a loaf bought for a Pundiyon (a 12th of a Dinar) when four Sa'in of wheat cost a Sela (four Dinarim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Shimon):</span> It is two thirds of a loaf of a third of a Kav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Half of this loaf (R. Yochanan and R. Shimon argue about its size) is the size of a meal regarding a house with Tzara'as (if one stays in the house long enough to eat this much, the clothes he is wearing become Tamei);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>If one eats a quarter of this amount of Tamei food, he is disqualified from eating Terumah (until he immerses);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>An eighth of this amount is the Shi'ur for Tum'as Ochlim. (Rishonim argue about whether this is the Shi'ur to receive Tum'ah mid'Oraisa, to be Metamei other food, or for food to receive Hechsher to become Tamei.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Yochanan ben Berokah. He says that half a Kav suffices for two meals, so two Kabim are only eight meals. (She must eat 14 meals per week!)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Our Mishnah is unlike R. Shimon. He holds that two ninths of a Kav is two meals, so two Kabim are 18 meals!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Yochanan ben Berokah. Our calculation was imprecise, because bread costs more than the wheat it is made from!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A third of the price of bread is the grocer's profit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (If so, a third of Kav makes two meals.) Still, two Kabim are only 12 meals!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She eats with him on Shabbos night from his food.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> This is like the opinion that 'eats' is literal. It does not answer for the opinion that it is a euphemism for Bi'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Even according to the former opinion, this accounts for only 13 meals!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, we rely on the teaching of Rav Chisda that says that half the price of bread is the grocer's mark-up.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Chisda contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When the grocer supplies the firewood, the mark-up is a half. When the buyer gives the wood, the mark-up is a third. (Rashba - her husband supplies her with firewood. The Mishnah mentions only the quantities of food he must give.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (If so, a quarter Kav of wheat makes two meals). Two Kabim are 16 meals! (This is more than she needs each week.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Chidka, who obligates eating four meals on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer 2:</span> Our Mishnah can be like Chachamim (who obligate eating only three meals on Shabbos). The extra meal is for guests.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (k)):</span> Based on this, we can even say that our Mishnah is like R. Shimon. The extra meals are for guests!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> Only R. Yishmael allots barley...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Edom the only place where people eat barley?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R Yosi says that only R. Yishmael allots twice as much barley as wheat, since barley of Edom is bad.</p>
