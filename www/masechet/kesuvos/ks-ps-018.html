<p class="dedicationbox">KESUVOS 18 (1 Adar) - dedicated in memory of Mordecai (Marcus) ben Elimelech Shmuel Kornfeld, who perished in the Holocaust along with most of his family. His Yahrzeit is observed on 1 Adar. May his death and the deaths of the other Kedoshim of the Holocaust atone for us like Korbanos. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHY THE MISHNAH DID NOT TEACH A DIFFERENT CASE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah should teach that R. Yehoshua agrees that if Reuven tells Shimon 'I borrowed 100 from you and repaid you', he is believed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana wanted to teach in the Seifa that if there are witnesses about the matter Reuven admitted to, he is not believed. Regarding the suggested case, this is not true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We hold that if one borrowed money with witnesses (without a document), he may return the money <i>without</i> witnesses (so Reuven <i>would</i> be believed!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah should teach that R. Yehoshua agrees that if Reuven tells Shimon 'I borrowed 100 from your father and repaid half', he is believed (without an oath)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot teach this according to either Tana (in the coming Beraisa)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that Reuven is like a Meshiv Aveidah (one who returns a lost object. Rashi - he need not swear when Shimon claims from him. Tosfos - he need not swear even if witnesses knew about the loan!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov holds that Reuven must swear!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> Sometimes a person must swear due to his own claim, e.g. if Reuven told Shimon 'I borrowed 100 from your father and repaid half';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim say that he is like a Meshiv Aveidah, and he need not swear.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE OATH FOR PARTIAL ADMISSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Doesn't R. Eliezer ben Yakov agree that a Meshiv Aveidah need not swear?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> (He agrees when there is no claim against him.) The case is, a child claims that he owes the full 100.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned that one does not swear in response to the claim of a child, deaf person or lunatic!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav meant that an adult claims the full 100. He calls him a child, because an adult is like a child regarding his father's affairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why is this called swearing due to his own claim? It is someone else's claim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is someone else's claim, and Reuven's own admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Every case (of the oath for partial admission) is due to someone else's claim and a person's own admission!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (c)):</span> (Really, a child claims. One does not swear due to a child's claim of his own money, but one swears due to a child's claim of his father's money.) The argument is based on Rabah's teaching:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> Why did the Torah impose an oath for a partial admission? (The person should be believed, Migo (since) he could have denied the entire claim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> We have a Chazakah (a rule of human nature) that a person lacks the audacity to deny the claim of his creditor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He would like to deny it entirely, but he cannot be so brazen.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>To avoid being so brazen, he would like to admit to the full claim. He denies part, in order to evade the rest of his debt until he can pay it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The Torah imposes an oath on him, so that he will admit to the full claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says that a borrower could not be brazen to the lender, and not to the lender's son. Therefore, he is not like a Meshiv Aveidah, and he must swear against the son's claim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Chachamim say that he could be brazen to the lender's son. Since he chooses not to be brazen and to admit, he is like a Meshiv Aveidah, so he need not swear.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WITNESSES WHO SAY THAT THEY SIGNED IMPROPERLY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If witnesses say 'these are our signatures, but we were forced to sign', or 'at the time we were minors or invalid witnesses', they are believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If other witnesses recognize their signatures, or if we can match their signatures to an authenticated document that they signed, they are not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rami bar Chama):</span> They are not believed only when they claim that they signed due to a monetary threat. If they say that they signed to save their lives, they are believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> No! Once they have testified (by signing), they cannot retract their testimony!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this principal refers only to oral testimony, but not to written testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Reish Lakish taught that witnesses signed on a document are treated like testimony that was investigated (and accepted) by Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rami bar Chama's law applies to the Reisha. They are believed only when they claim that they signed because of a mortal threat. If they say that they signed to save their money, they are not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because a person cannot establish himself to be a Rasha (to invalidate his testimony).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> (If witnesses say 'these are our signatures, but we were forced to sign',) they are not believed to invalidate the document;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Chachamim say, they are believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand the Chachamim. Ha'Peh she'Asar Hu ha'Peh she'Hitir (the one who forbade is believed to permit. Since we cannot verify the document without them, they are believed to invalidate it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But what is the reason of R. Meir?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We understand why they are not believed to say that they were invalid witnesses. Surely, the lender checked that his witnesses are valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We also understand why they are not believed to say that they were children. Reish Lakish taught that there is a Chazakah that witnesses sign a document only if all the parties are adults!</p>
