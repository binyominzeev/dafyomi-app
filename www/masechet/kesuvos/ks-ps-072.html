<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, forbidding her to go to banquet halls is a barrier in front of her (Simchah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Why is forbidding her to go to a house of mourning a barrier?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Version #1:</span> When she will die, no one will come to eulogize her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> When she will die, no one will come to bury her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "It is better to go to the house of Aveilus than to the banquet hall, since it is the end of every man, and <i>the living will put to his heart</i>" - this refers to matters of death;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who eulogizes will be eulogized. One who buries will be buried. One who wails will be wailed over. One who accompanies a Mes will be accompanied. One who carries a Mes will be carried.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may do so if he claims that this is due of another matter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this other matter?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> Licentious people are found there.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> This is only if they are known to be there. If not, he cannot forbid her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he says, on condition that you tell...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Why must he divorce her and pay a Kesuvah?) She can tell!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> He asked her to tell shameful things.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Or, you must fill...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Why must he divorce her and pay a Kesuvah?) She can do this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> He asked her to remove his semen after Bi'ah to prevent pregnancy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> He asked her to fill 10 jugs of water and spill them at the dumping site.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Yehudah, we understand why he must divorce her and pay her Kesuvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But according to the Beraisa, what difference does it make to her? She can do what he says!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> It would make her appear like a lunatic.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If one vowed that his wife may not borrow nor lend a sifter, mill or oven he must divorce her and pay her Kesuvah, since this gives her a bad reputation among her neighbors.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one vowed that his wife may not borrow nor lend a sifter, mill or oven he must divorce her and pay her Kesuvah, since this gives her a bad reputation among her neighbors;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Similarly, if she vowed that she will not borrow nor lend a sifter, mill or oven, and will not weave nice clothes for his children, he may divorce her without paying her Kesuvah, since this gives him a bad reputation among his neighbors.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WOMEN WHO FORFEIT THEIR KESUVOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are divorced and do not receive a Kesuvah: one who transgresses Das Moshe (Torah law) or Das Yehudis (the ways of Benos Yisrael);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Transgressing Das Moshe is feeding him untithed food, having Bi'ah with him when she is Nidah, not separating Chalah, or vowing and transgressing her vows;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Transgressing Das Yehudis is going out with her head uncovered, spinning in the market, or talking with every man.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Aba Sha'ul says, it is even one who curses his ancestors in front of him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Tarfon says, it is even a loud-voiced woman.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is one who can be heard by neighbors when she speaks in her house.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the case of feeding him untithed food?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he knows that it is untithed, he should not eat it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he does not know that it is untithed, how does he know that she fed him untithed food?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She said that Ploni separated the tithes. He asked Ploni, and found that she lied.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She has Bi'ah with him when she is Nidah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he knows that she is Nidah, he should refrain!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he does not know that she is Nidah, he should believe her that she was not a Nidah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chinena bar Kahana):</span> "She will count seven days" teaches that she counts to herself (and is believed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> She said that Ploni declared that the blood she saw does not make her Nidah. He asked Ploni, and found that she lied.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is like Rav Yehudah taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a woman was established to be a Nidah among her neighbors, her husband is lashed for having Bi'ah with her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She does not separate Chalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he knows that it was not separated, he should not eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he does not know that it was not separated, how does he know that she did not separate?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She said that Ploni the kneader separated the Chalah; he asked Ploni, and found that she lied.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She vows and transgresses her vows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>This is grounds to divorce her and not pay her Kesuvah, since children die due to vows of the parents.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Don't let your mouth diminish your flesh...(and destroy your handiwork)" - the handiwork of man is his children.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> "In vain I struck your children" - for matters of vain (oaths).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One who knows that his wife vows and transgresses her vows should impose vows on her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This will not help!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he should anger her so she will vow in front of him and he can annul the vows;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>Chachamim say, a man cannot live with a snake in a basket (he divorces her and does not pay a Kesuvah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> One who knows that his wife does not separate Chalah should separate it himself;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>Chachamim say, a man cannot live with a snake in a basket.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p>R. Yehudah counsels to stay married to a wife who does not separate Chalah. All the more so, he counsels to keep a wife who transgresses her vows (like R. Meir, above);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir counsels to keep a wife who transgresses her vows, but he would counsel divorcing one who doesn't separate Chalah, lest he forget and eat.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Das Yehudis... she goes out with her hair uncovered...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Uncovered hair is mid'Oraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "He will uncover her hair" warns (married) Benos Yisrael that they should not go out with uncovered hair.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">72b----------------------------------------72b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mid'Oraisa, it suffices to have a basket on her head. This does not fulfill Das Yehudis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> A basket on the head is considered covered (even for Das Yehudis).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Where is it sufficient?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In the market this does not fulfill Das Yehudis!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is considered covered in the courtyard.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If she must cover her hair in the courtyard, no married Bas Yisrael can fulfill this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It suffices in the alleyway between courtyards.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She spins in the market.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The case is, she reveals her arms to men.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> She spins with a thread dangling by her (Ervah, i.e. lower) 'face'.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> She jokes with young men.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Rav Ukva saw an Araviya spinning, with a thread by her face. She threw her stick, and asked Rav Ukva to retrieve it. Rav Ukva made a remark.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> He said that this is spinning in the market.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> He said that this is speaking with all men.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Aba Sha'ul):</span> Even if she curses his ancestors in front of him...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is (even) if she curses his ancestors in front of his children.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Siman to remember this is "Efrayim and Menasheh will be like Reuven and Shimon to me." (Many explain that the Siman is from the continuation "U'Moladtecha Asher Holadta Achareihem Lecha Yiheyu..." Ritva - this shows that one's children are like himself. Gra (EH 115:13) - the verse shows that 'Moldav' refers to children, and Yoldav' refers to parents.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> In front of his son she says to him 'A lion should eat your father'.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is one who audibly asks for Bi'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> When she has Bi'ah in this courtyard, she can be heard in another courtyard.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MARRIAGE ON CONDITION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man was Mekadesh a woman on condition that she has no vows and she was found to have, she is not Mekudeshes;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he did Nisu'in Stam (without specifying) and she was found to have vows, she leaves without a Kesuvah;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was taught here for the law of Kesuvos, and the law of Kidushin was added on. It was taught there for the law of Kidushin, and the law of Kesuvos was added on.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Our Mishnah discusses vows not eat meat, drink wine, or wear colored clothing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> The law applies to vows of affliction, i.e. not to eat meat, drink wine, or wear colored clothing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> To which part of the Mishnah does this apply?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It applies to the Reisha (Kidushin on condition that she has no vows).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, any vow invalidates the Kidushin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> It applies to the Seifa (he (was Mekadesh and) did Nisu'in Stam. If she has one of these vows, she leaves without a Kesuvah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Really, it applies to the Reisha. His insistence (that she have no vows) applies only to things that people care about.</p></div>
