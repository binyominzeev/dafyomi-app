<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BIRCHOS CHASANIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Berachos are:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"... Who created everything for His honor".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"... Who forms man".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"... Who formed man in his image... Baruch Atah Hash-m, Who forms man."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Rejoice and make rejoice... Baruch Atah Hash-m, Who gladdens Tziyon with her children."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"Be happy, loving companions... Baruch Atah Hash-m, Who gladdens Chasan and Kalah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>"... Who created happiness... Baruch Atah Hash-m, Who makes the Chasan rejoice with the Kalah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Levi came to Rebbi's house at the wedding of R. Shimon, Rebbi's son; he blessed five of these Berachos (he omitted 'Yotzer ha'Adam').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Asi came to Rav Ashi's house at the wedding of Rav Ashi's son Mar; he blessed all six Berachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Levi said only one Berachah about Yetzirah because he holds that there was one Yetzirah (Hash-m formed Adam and Chavah at once). Rav Asi said both of them because he holds that there were two Yetziros (Adam, and later Chavah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Both agree that there was only one Yetzirah. Rav Asi makes two Berachos because Hash-m intended to create two people;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Levi says that we follow the actual Yetzirah, and there was only one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Yehudah):</span> It says "Hash-m created man in His image", and it says "He created them male and female"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He intended to create two. He actually created one.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN WE MAKE <i>BIRKAS</i> <i>CHASANIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Ashi came to Rav Kahana's house. The first day he made all the Berachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>After the first day, if there were new faces he would bless all the Berachos. If not, they merely increase Simchah, so he blessed only "...that joy is in His dwelling", and "Who created joy..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>From seven days after the wedding until 30, whether or not the guests were invited due to the wedding, he blessed "...that joy is in His dwelling".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>After 30 days, if the guests were invited due to the wedding, he blessed "that joy is in His dwelling"; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For how long does one say this when the guests were invited due to the wedding?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papi):</span> He says it for 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From when does one start saying the Berachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> He starts from when he soaks the barley (to make beer for the Nisu'in. Alternatively, he soaks barley to be an omen that the couple will be fruitful.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Papa arranged a match for his son and blessed from the time of the Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Papa is an exception. He had all needs of the Chupah ready.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Ravina arranged a match for his son into the family of Rav Chaviva and blessed from the time of the Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He did so because he was sure that they would not retract. In the end, they retracted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav Tachlifa went to Bavel and blessed six long Berachos (he lengthened the first two and was Chosem 'Baruch Atah Hash-m... )' The Halachah does not follow this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rav Chaviva went to a meal celebrating a Bris. He blessed "...that joy is in His dwelling." The Halachah does not follow this, because people are disturbed that the baby is in pain.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE <i>BERACHAH</i> OF MOURNERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Chasan counts towards the number (10) needed to say Birkas Chasanim. Mourners do not count towards the number needed to say Birkas Avelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Chasanim and mourners count.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav is a Tana. He may disagree with a Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Chasanim count towards the required number, but mourners do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Chasanim and mourners count.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa discusses (Tosfos - Birkas Avelim said in) Birkas ha'Mazon. R. Yochanan's law applies to the line of consolers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yochanan said that we bless Birkas Chasanim with 10, and Chasanim count towards the 10. We bless Birkas Avelim with 10, and mourners do not count towards the 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is no Berachah in the line of consolers!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, R. Yochanan's law applies to the street (where we give to the mourner his first meal).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan said that we bless Birkas Chasanim with 10 all seven days, and Chasanim count towards the 10. We bless Birkas Avelim with 10 all seven days, and mourners do not count towards the 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we bless in the street all seven days?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes, we bless when new consolers come.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE CONSOLATION OF REISH LAKISH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Chiya bar Aba taught the children of Reish Lakish; one of them died. He did not go the first day to console him. He went the second day. He told Yehudah bar Nachmani to say words of consolation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> "From the anger of his children" - when the parents sin, Hash-m is angry at the children, and they die in childhood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Some say that an older child died. Yehudah cited "Hash-m will not rejoice on his youths... "</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan bar Rav):</span> "... His hand is still stretched" - all know why a Kalah enters the Chupah, but if one fouls his mouth by saying something obscene, even if 70 good years had been decreed for him, they are changed for evil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not consolation. These words provoke pain!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant 'you (Reish Lakish) are worthy to bear the punishments fitting to come on the generation.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Aba:</span> Discuss the praise of Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> "The great G-d... Baruch Atah Hash-m, Who revives the dead."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Aba:</span> Address the mourners.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> Our afflicted brothers, put your hearts to investigate this... many drank (the cup of afflictions), and many will drink. The drinking of the later ones will resemble the drinking of the first ones... Blessed is He Who consoles mourners.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One should say 'many drank', but not 'many will drink.' One should say 'the drinking of the first ones', but not 'the drinking of the later ones'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> A person should not suggest to the Satan (that he is worthy to be punished).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> He learns from "We were like Sodom." Hash-m replied "Hear the word of Hash-m, officers of Sodom".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Aba:</span> Speak about the praise of the consolers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> Our brothers, bestowers of Chesed, children of bestowers of Chesed... Baruch Atah Hash-m, Who pays reward.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Aba:</span> Speak on behalf of all of Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> Master of the worlds, redeem and save Your nation Yisrael from pestilence, sword,... Baruch Atah Hash-m, Who stops the plague.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE CUPS OF CONSOLATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> It was enacted that the mourner drink 10 cups of wine: three before the meal, to open his intestines (to help him to eat); three during the meal, to digest the food; and four after the meal, corresponding to the four Berachos of Birkas ha'Mazon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>They added four more cups, corresponding to community servants, leaders of the city (both of these used to assist in burials), the Beis ha'Mikdash, and R. Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This led to drunkenness, so they returned to the former enactment (10 cups).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was a Berachah enacted corresponding to R. Gamliel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> It used to be that the expense of burial pained the mourners more than the loss (because everyone used to buy expensive shrouds). Mourners would abandon the deceased and flee! R. Gamliel (the Nasi) buried his Mes in simple linen shrouds, and everyone followed his example.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Today the custom is to make shrouds of hemp, which cost only a Zuz.</p>
