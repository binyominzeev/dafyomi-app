<p class="dedicationbox">KESUVOS 53 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>PRESSURE ON THE FATHER TO GIVE A DOWRY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav Papa was marrying off his son to a daughter of Aba Sura'ah. He went to Aba Sura'ah's house to write the Kesuvah. (Presumably, Aba Sura'ah would likewise give to his daughter.) Yehudah bar Meremar accompanied Rav Papa, and showed that he did not want to enter the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Perhaps you do not want to enter due to Shmuel's opinion?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel (to Rav Yehudah):</span> Do not take part in transferring inheritance, even from a bad son to a good son. Perhaps the bad son will have good offspring!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> All the more so, one should not transfer from a son to a daughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> Chachamim decreed to encourage dowries, like R. Yochanan taught above!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> That is when the father wants to give. He should not be coerced!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> I do not ask you to coerce him, merely to enter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Yehudah bar Meremar:</span> My entering is like coercing (he will give more, to honor me)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Papa coerced Yehudah to enter. Yehudah sat silently. Aba Sura'ah thought 'he is angry because I am not giving enough.' He wrote all his property to his daughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Aba Sura'ah:</span> You still won't speak?! I swear that I didn't leave anything for myself!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> I disapproved of giving even the first amount!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Aba Sura'ah:</span> If so, I will retract!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> I do not counsel you to be a retractor.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN ARE PRIVILEGES OF THE KESUVAH FORFEITED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yemar):</span> If a woman sold her Kesuvah to her husband, does she still have Kesuvas Benin Dichrin?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> You should ask about if she pardoned the Kesuvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yemar:</span> I asked about one who sold her Kesuvah, even though she was forced (by the need for money) as if she was beaten 100 times. All the more so, if she pardoned it (I ask whether or not she forfeits Kesuvas Benin Dichrin)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Clearly, if she sells the Kesuvah to others, she retains Kesuvas Benin Dichrin. Financial pressure forced her;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If she pardons the Kesuvah to her husband, clearly she loses Kesuvas Benin Dichrin. She pardoned it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If she sold the Kesuvah to her husband, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Is this like selling it to others, or like pardoning to her husband?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is like selling to others.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Idi bar Avin - Mishnah):</span> If a woman (who remarried based on a witness who (falsely) testified that her husband died) died, her heirs from both husbands do not inherit her Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah already said that she receives no Kesuvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Her heirs do not receive Kesuvas Benin Dichrin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> According to Rava's reasoning, they should receive it. Her desire to remarry is like being forced!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, Chachamim fined her. (Chachamim were lenient to let her remarry through one witness, relying on her to first verify that her husband truly died.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin bar Chanina citing R. Elazar):</span> One who pardons her Kesuvah to her husband is not fed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Had you not said that in the name of a great Chacham, I would apply "One who repays evil for good, evil will not depart from his home" (and she should be fed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>An Arusah died. Rav Nachman, Ula and Avimi ruled that the Arus must bury her or pay her Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chiya bar Ami - Mishnah):</span> If an Arus or Arusah died, the law of an Onen (one who lost a relative, before the burial) does not apply to the spouse, and the spouse does not become Tamei by engaging in the burial;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If she died, he does not inherit her. If he died, she collects a Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> When she dies, there is no Kesuvah. (I.e. we do not obligate him to bury her in exchange for inheriting her dowry, like we said about a Nesu'ah - 47b, 3:b.)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Hoshaya):</span> This is because "When you will (be allowed to) marry another, you will receive what I wrote to you" does not apply. (All laws of the Kesuvah, e.g. burial and inheritance of her property, do not apply.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> An Arusah who died does not receive a Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> We already learned this from R. Hoshaya!</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HOW LONG ARE ORPHAN GIRLS FED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Daughters you will have from me (will be fed)...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Mishnah reads 'until they are taken by men';</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Levi):</span> It reads 'until Bagrus (6 months after Na'arus)'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rav really say that she is fed after Bagrus? Does Levi really say that she is fed after marriage?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Clarification:</span> Both agree that she is not fed after Bagrus <i>or</i> Nisu'in. They argue about after Kidushin but before Bagrus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Levi taught in his version of the Mishnah 'until Bagrus and the time for Nisu'in comes.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Does she eat until both come?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he taught 'until Bagrus <i>or</i> the time for Nisu'in.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Tana'im argue as Rav and Levi do:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Girls are fed until Kidushin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar says, They are fed until Bagrus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> (They are fed) until they will be (married) to men.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this mean until Kidushin, or until Nisu'in?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda to Rav Yosef):</span> Did you hear Rav Yehudah's opinion about whether or not an Arusah is fed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> I did not hear, but presumably she is not fed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since she is Mekudeshes, her husband does not want her to be disgraced (by having to beg. Since he will feed her, she is not fed from her father's estate).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Chisda):</span> Logically, she should be fed! Her husband is unsure whether or not she has a Mum (a blemish that would invalidate the marriage), so he will not freely throw away his money (to feed her. Therefore, she is fed from her father's estate.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> I didn't hear, but presumably, she is fed. Her husband is unsure whether or not she has a Mum, so he will not feed her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Chisda):</span> Just the opposite! Since she is Mekudeshes, her husband does not want her to be disgraced.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHICH GIRLS ARE FED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a girl did Mi'un, is she fed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> A widow, divorcee or Yevamah in her father's house is fed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, she is fed only if she is still in her father's house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Tana said the same!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they argue about a Mema'enes. The first Tana says that she is fed; R. Yehudah says that she is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> Is the daughter of a Yevamah from her Yavam fed after the Yavam dies?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since we learned that she collects her Kesuvah from the property of her first husband, she is not fed (he obligated himself to feed only his own daughters);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since if there is not property from the first husband the Yavam writes her a Kesuvah from his own property, she is fed!</p></div>
