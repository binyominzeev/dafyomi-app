<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WE REQUIRE TWO MAJORITIES FOR LINEAGE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> He holds like R. Yehoshua. He was lenient for the following reasons.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The episode happened on the market day in Tzipori.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Many Kosher people passed by.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> If Bi'ah took place in the wagons, she may marry a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely he does not mean in the wagons!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if Bi'ah was at the time when caravans are frequent, she may marry a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a man of Tzipori separated and had Bi'ah, the child would be a Shtuki, like Ze'iri taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> We follow the majority of the city, but not the majority of passers-by.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It is more reasonable to say the opposite! Passers-by are transient (so we may assume one came from the majority), but people of the city are Kavu'a (fixed)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, we follow the (Kosher) majority of the city, but only if there is also a (Kosher) majority of passers-by.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>A single majority is insufficient. If we would rely on a majority of passers-by, we would come to rely on a majority of city people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A majority of city dwellers is enough, if he separated and went to her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sometimes, she goes to him, and he is Kavu'a;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Any doubt about an Isur Kavu'a is considered an even doubt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not require two majorities!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If nine stores sell Kosher meat and one sells Neveilah meat and one bought from one of the stores and does not know from which, the meat is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If meat is found (in the market), we follow the majority.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is only if the doors of the city are open and a majority of passers-by sell Kosher meat (there are two majorities).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Zeira said that found meat is permitted, even if the city doors are locked!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a stringency of lineage to require two majorities.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>FIXED ISURIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> A Kavu'a Isur is always considered an even doubt, whether this is a leniency or a stringency.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What it his source for this law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> If nine stores sell slaughtered meat and one sells Neveilah, and one bought from one of the stores and does not know from which, the meat is forbidden. If meat is found, we follow the majority.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There we are stringent. (We cannot learn from there to be lenient.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If one Tamei Sheretz (reptile) is among nine frogs (they are Tehorim) and someone touched one of the 10 and does not know which, he is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Also there we are stringent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> If one frog is among nine Sheratzim and someone touched one of the 10 and does not know which:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If this was in a private domain, he is Tamei. If it was in a public domain, he is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source from the Torah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He waits in hiding" - a murderer is killed only if he intended to kill his victim (this is like R. Shimon. Our source is according to Chachamim who disagree);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(D'Vei R. Yanai):</span> Chachamim say that this excludes one who throws a rock into a crowd.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is in the crowd?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If there are nine Nochrim and one Yisrael, even if we follow the majority we cannot kill the murderer!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If half of them are Yisraelim, we are always lenient about a Safek in capital cases (we would not need a verse to teach the law)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are nine Yisraelim and one Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> Since they are Kevu'im, we considered it to be an even doubt.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HOW DO WE ESTABLISH OUR MISHNAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi (in our Mishnah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan bar Rava):</span> The case of our Mishnah was a Hora'as Sha'ah (a special temporary ruling for an urgent need).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> We always require two majorities for lineage!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a baby was found deserted:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the majority of the city is Nochrim, the child is a Nochri. If most are Yisraelim, he is a Yisrael. If half the city is Yisrael, he is a Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We follow the majority to support him, but not for lineage.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> ...To unearth him on Shabbos (e.g. if a house collapsed on him).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yirmiyah had not heard that Rav established our Mishnah to be on the market day, and there were two majorities.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is difficult for Rav Chanan! (He said that it was a Hora'as Sha'ah to require two majorities in our Mishnah. Rav (normally) does not follow one majority for lineage!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that Rav did not establish our Mishnah to be on the market day.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>A DESERTED BABY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a baby was found deserted:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the majority of the city is Nochrim, the child is a Nochri. If most are Yisraelim, he is a Yisrael. If half the city is Yisrael, he is a Yisrael.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> ...To unearth him on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere, Shmuel taught that we do not follow the majority when there is mortal danger!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Shmuel refers to the Reisha. If the majority is Nochrim the child is a Nochri, but <i>not</i> regarding unearth him. (We Mechalel Shabbos, for perhaps he is a Yisrael.).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To what does Shmuel apply 'if most are Nochrim, he is a Nochri'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> We may feed him Neveilos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To what do we apply 'if most are Yisraelim, he is a Yisrael'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> We return a lost item to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To what do we apply 'if half are Yisraelim, he is a Yisrael'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> This applies to damages.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If a Yisrael's ox gored his ox he should be exempt until the victim proves that he is a Yisrael!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the case is that his ox gored the ox of a Yisrael. He pays half damage, like a Yisrael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He is exempt from paying the other half unless the victim proves that he is not a Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK HA'ISHAH SHE'NIS'ARMELAH</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>IS A WOMAN BELIEVED TO SAY THAT SHE WAS A VIRGIN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a widow or divorcee claims that she was a virgin when she was married, and he says that she was a widow, if witnesses say that she had a Hinuma (a dome of myrtle or a veil) and uncovered hair at the Chupah, her Kesuvah is 200;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yochanan ben Berokah says, even if they distributed parched grain (at the Chupah), this proves that she was a virgin;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehoshua agrees that if Reuven says to Shimon 'this field belonged to your father and I bought it from him', Reuven is believed. The one who forbids is believed to permit (without his admission Shimon had no claim);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If witnesses testify that the field belonged to Shimon's father, and Reuven says 'I bought it from him', he is not believed.</p></div>
