<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A PROTEST ABOUT A JUDGE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> If three judges sat to validate a document and there was an objection that one of them is invalid:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they did not yet sign, the other two may testify that the third is valid, then all may sign;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they already signed, they may not. (Their testimony is biased, for it is shameful to be on a Beis Din with an invalid judge.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the accusation?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They say that he stole.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> After the other judges defend him, there are two witnesses who say that he is valid, and two who disagree. (He is Safek Pasul. Such a judge may not be used!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They say that his lineage disqualifies him (he is a slave).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This is easily verifiable. (They should be able to defend him even after they signed!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1:</span> Really, they say that he stole. The other judges testify that he did Teshuvah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MAKING IT CLEAR THAT THERE WERE THREE JUDGES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> If three judges sat to validate a document and one died, they must write 'three of us sat, and one is no longer.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It suffices if it says 'this document came before Beis Din.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it was an impudent Beis Din (of two)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If two judged the verdict stands, just it is called a brazen Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says 'the Beis Din of Rav Ashi.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Rabanan of Rav Ashi's academy hold like Shmuel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says 'Rav Ashi told us to validate this document.' (Surely, he told three.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE ONE WHO FORBIDS IS BELIEVED TO PERMIT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman says 'I was married and divorced', she is believed. The one who forbids is believed to permit;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If there are witnesses that she was married, and she says that she was divorced, she is not believed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If a woman says 'I was taken captive, but I am Tehorah (I was not defiled)', she is believed. The one who forbids is believed to permit;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If there are witnesses that she was taken captive and she says that she is Tehorah, she is not believed;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If witnesses come after she married, she may remain married.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Asi):</span> The Torah teaches that the one who forbids is believed to permit - "I gave my daughter to this man for a wife".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Once he said "I gave her", he forbade her (to all men). By saying "to this man", he permits her to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why must a verse teach this? Logic dictates that since he forbade her, he can permit her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, the verse teaches Rav Huna's law:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> "I gave my daughter" teaches that a man can forbid his daughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "to <i>this</i> man"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches the following law:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yonah - Beraisa):</span> "To this man", not to a Yavam (Motzi Shem Ra does not apply to a brother who did Levirate marriage).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman said 'I am married' and later she said 'I am single'; she is believed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> She declared herself to be forbidden. How can she retract this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava bar Rav Huna):</span> She gave an Amasla (a plausible reason why she lied).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a woman said 'I am married' and later she said 'I am single'; she is not believed. If she gave an Amasla, she is believed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A case occurred in which many men were proposing to be Mekadesh an important, beautiful woman. She said 'I am Mekudeshes.' Days later, she accepted Kidushin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Why did you do this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">The woman:</span> At first, improper men came to me, so I said that I was Mekudeshes (to divert them). Now that proper men came, I was Mekadesh myself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Rav Acha said this law in front of the Chachamim in Usha. They said that if she gives an Amasla, she is believed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel):</span> If a woman tells her husband that she is Nidah and later she says that she is Tehorah, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Also here, she is believed to give an Amasla.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel learned this teaching from Rav 40 times. Still, he himself did not rely on it in practice.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>A DISPUTE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT A WOMAN IS MARRIED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If two witnesses say that a woman's husband died or divorced her and two say that he did not, she may not remarry. If she remarried, she may remain married;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Menachem bar Yosi says, she must leave her husband;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is only if witnesses (the ones who forbid) came before she remarried. If she remarried before they came, she may remain married.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have contradictory testimony. Perhaps she is still married to the first man! One who has Bi'ah with her must bring a Korban Asham Taluy (for a Safek Chiyuv Kares. How can we let her stay married to the second man?)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> She married one of the witnesses who say that she was widowed or divorced.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> She (who is in doubt) must bring an Asham. How can we let her stay married?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she is sure.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If two witnesses say that a man died and two say that he did not die, his wife may not remarry. If she remarried, she may remain married;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>If two say that she was divorced and two say that she was not divorced; she may not remarry. If she remarried, she must leave.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the law different in the two cases?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Really, only one witness says that she was widowed or divorced and one contradicts him. Chachamim believe one witness who says that a man died to permit his wife to remarry, like Ula taught;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Wherever the Torah believes one witness, he is believed like two.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The witness who says that he didn't die is like one witness against two, so we ignore him. (She may remain married.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, she should be allowed to get married!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She may not, due to Rav Asi'a teaching;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> "Divert from yourself harsh talk and distance from yourself accusations."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>In the second case of R. Yochanan, both testify that she <i>was</i> married, but only one says that she was divorced. We do not believe one against two.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Really, there are two witnesses on each side. R. Yochanan holds like R. Menachem regarding divorce, but not regarding death.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that she checks carefully about his death, for if he returns she cannot refute that he never died;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>She does not check carefully about divorce. If he contradicts her, people will not know what truly happened.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does a wife have the nerve to lie to her husband about this?!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> If a woman told her husband 'you divorced me', she is believed. There is a Chazakah that a wife lacks the audacity to lie to him about this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when witnesses do not support her. In R. Yochanan's case, two witnesses say that she was divorced.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Asi):</span> The witnesses say that just now she was widowed or divorced.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding death, we cannot clarify which witnesses are lying;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding divorce, if she really was divorced she would be able to show her Get!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If two witnesses say that a woman became Mekudeshes and two deny it; she may not marry (someone else). If she married, she may remain married;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>If two say that she was divorced and two say that she was not, she may not remarry. If she remarried, she may not remain married.</p></div>
