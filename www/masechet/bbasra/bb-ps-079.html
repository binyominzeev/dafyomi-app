<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO CEASES TO LEARN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Anyone who ceases to learn Torah is consumed by fire - "veha'Esh Tochelem".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> Anyone who separates himself from learning Torah falls to Gehinom - "To'eh mi'Derech Haskel bi'Khal Refa'im Yanu'ach";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Refa'im' refers to Gehinom - "Refa'im Sham b'Imkei She'ol."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS THAT BECOME FULL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sells a wasteheap, the manure is included...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If something is fit for (can be offered on) the Altar but not for Bedek ha'Bayis, or is only fit for Hekdesh Bedek ha'Bayis, or is not fit for either, Me'ilah applies to it and its contents;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one was Makdish a pit full of water, a wasteheap full of manure, a dovecote full of doves, a field full of grass, or a tree laden with fruit, Me'ilah applies to it and its contents;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if he was Makdish an empty pit (or wasteheap...) and it became full of water (or manure...), Me'ilah applies to it, but not to what came later.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi says, if one was Makdish a field or a tree, Me'ilah applies to it and what grows, for what grows is Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Nir'im (I agree with) R. Yehudah's opinion about a pit and dovecote, and R. Yosi's opinion about a field and tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand 'I agree with R. Yehudah about a pit and dovecote', which implies that R. Yosi disagrees about a field and tree (Rebbi holds like R. Yosi regarding them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, 'I agree with R. Yosi regarding a field and tree' implies that R. Yosi disagrees about a pit and dovecote. We do not find that R. Yosi and R. Yehudah argue about these!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yosi addresses R. Yehudah according to R. Yehudah's reasoning. (I (R. Yosi) argue in all cases. I understand why you (R. Yehudah) argue about a pit and dovecote, but you should admit about a field or tree, for what grows is Hekdesh!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> I disagree with R. Yehudah about a field and tree, for what grows is Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He agrees about a pit and dovecote!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi means, R. Yehudah's words about a pit and dovecote are Nir'im to R. Yosi (he agrees with them); R. Yosi argues only about a field and tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was Makdish them when they are empty and then they became full, Me'ilah applies to it, but not to what came later;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, Me'ilah applies also to what came later.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> They argue about a field and tree. The first Tana holds like R. Yehudah, and R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon holds like R. Yosi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree about a pit and dovecote (that Me'ilah applies to the contents).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If one was Makdish them when they are full, Me'ilah applies to them and their contents;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon switches (what he said about one who was Makdish them empty. Here he says that Me'ilah does not apply to the contents.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">79b----------------------------------------79b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon argued about a field and tree, why does he switch his opinion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rabah):</span> They argue about a pit and dovecote;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree about a field and tree that Me'ilah applies to them and their contents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding a pit and dovecote, what do they argue about when they are initially empty and when they are initially full?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> When they are initially empty, they argue as R. Meir and Chachamim argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana holds like Chachamim, that one cannot transfer ownership of (or be Makdish) something that is not yet in the world;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon holds like R. Meir, that one can transfer ownership of something that is not yet in the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir said so only regarding fruits of a date tree, for they normally grow. An empty pit or dovecote will not fill itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, the pit is at the bottom of an incline (water normally flows into it), and the dovecote is near a thriving dovecote (presumably, offspring from the full dovecote will inhabit the empty one).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question - part 2:</span> When they are initially full, what do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, he said 'the pit (or dovecote) is Hekdesh' without specifying;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon holds like his father. We learn the law of Hekdesh from the law of commoners;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A seller could say 'I sold only the pit, but not the water. Likewise, the pit becomes Hekdesh, but not the water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(The first Tana does not learn the law of Hekdesh from the law of commoners. Maharshal deletes this from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A seller could not say 'I sold only the pit'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sells a pit, the water is included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> That Mishnah is the opinion of one Tana. Chachamim argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sells a pit, the water is not included;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Noson says, the water is included.</p>
