<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED LIKE LAND?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> A beehive is like land:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We may write a Pruzbul on it (a lender may empower Beis Din to collect money owed to him by people who own land. This prevents the debts from being cancelled in Shemitah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is not Mekabel Tum'ah in its place;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If one took honey from it on Shabbos (b'Shogeg) he is Chayav Chatas, for this is like reaping.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, it is not like land. We may not write a Pruzbul on it. It is Mekabel Tum'ah in its place. If one took honey from it on Shabbos he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (of Answer #1, Sof 65b):</span> This does not show that R. Eliezer argues with the Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> R. Eliezer learns from "va'Yitbol Osah b'Ya'aros ha'Devash". Just like uprooting from a forest is a Melachah, also taking honey from a hive is a Melachah (since the Torah considers it to be attached).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 3:b:1, 65B):</span> R. Eliezer's opinion about a baker's board is unlike the Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a baker's board was fixed into the wall, it cannot become Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, it can become Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Summation of question (3:b, 65b):</span> The Beraisa is not like R. Eliezer. He considers attached Kelim like land, even if they were made and later attached;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, it is not like Chachamim. They consider attached Kelim to be like Metaltelim (movable objects), even if they were made after they were attached!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Really, the Beraisa is R. Eliezer. He is more lenient about the board because wooden Kelim that without a container are Mekabel Tum'ah only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that Mayim She'uvim (water that was in a Keli) disqualifies a Mikveh mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">66b----------------------------------------66b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> The Halachah is, it disqualifies a Mikveh only mid'Rabanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> R. Yosi ben R. Chanina taught that R. Eliezer and Chachamim argue about a metal board!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, the Beraisa is Chachamim. They are lenient about the pipe because Mayim She'uvim disqualifies a Mikveh only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, they should be lenient even if it was hollowed out and then attached!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are stringent then, for it was considered a Keli before it was attached.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OTHER LAWS SPECIAL TO LAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> If one intended that rain water wash the frame around a millstone, (is this like intention for something detached, i.e.) does the water now Machshir (enable) Peros to become Tamei? (Water is Machshir only if one intended to use to wash an object that was detached.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Eliezer, anything attached to the ground is like the ground, so surely the water is not Machshir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The question is according to Chachamim (Rashbam - of our Mishnah; Tosfos - in the Mishnah of the board).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rav Nechemyah brei d'Rav Yosef instructed Rabah bar Rav Huna to authorize a certain girl to collect a tenth of her father's estate (for her dowry), even from the frame around a millstone. (This is like R. Eliezer, who considers it like land.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> In Rav Kahana's academy, we collected even from rental of houses.</p>
