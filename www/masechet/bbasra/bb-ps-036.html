<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>INVALID CHAZAKOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Yisrael (Shimon) bought property from a Nochri, his law is like that of a Nochri;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a Nochri is not believed due to Chazakah, he must show a document, also one who bought from him (must show a document in which the original owner (Levi) sold to the Nochri).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Shimon says that the Nochri told him 'I bought it from Levi', he is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Nochri himself is not believed to say this. All the more so Shimon is not believed to say this in the Nochri's name!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, If Shimon says 'I saw the Nochri buy it from Levi', he is believed, Migo he could have said 'I bought it from Levi'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If Reuven held reaping tools and said 'I am going to reap (Tosfos - this is the correct text, like above (33b)) Shimon's tree. I bought it from him', he is believed, for one is not so brazen to reap another's Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A Chazakah in the land outside a wall around a field (which the owner normally seeds and allows animals to eat it, so they will not enter his field) is not a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The owner does not care about what grows there. He allows animals to eat it. (This is why he did not protest.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashbam) - (Rav Yehudah):</span> Eating Orlah does not contribute to the years of Chazakah. (The owner did not protest because one may not benefit from Orlah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Eating Orlah, Shemitah or Kilayim does not contribute to the years of Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - (Rav Yehudah):</span> Using Orlah (e.g. the vines themselves, which are permitted) is valid for Chazakah (this is the maximum benefit one can get from Orlah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Using Orlah, Shemitah or Kilayim is valid for Chazakah. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Reaping (grain prematurely when it is still) fodder is not a Chazakah (this is not normal usage of a field).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> In a place where people (have many animals and) normally reap fodder, it is a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashbam - (Rav Nachman):</span> Occupying an (unfarmable) field full of cracks is not a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Chananel - (Rav Nachman):</span> Farming a field without plowing (rather, allowing wind and sun to crack the earth) is not a Chazakah. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>If one harvested the same amount that he seeded, this does not make a Chazakah (the owner had no reason to protest).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>People of the Reish Galusa's house cannot make a Chazakah against others (others fear to protest), nor can others make a Chazakah against them (they are rich, and do not mind if others use their land and care for it. They know that they can retrieve it when they want.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHAZAKAH FOR GODEROS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Chazakah for slaves...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reish Lakish taught that there is no Chazakah for Goderos (anything that can walk by itself, i.e. animals or slaves)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They do not have an immediate Chazakah (we do not assume that one who holds them owns them), but Chazakah applies after three years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> There is an immediate Chazakah for an infant slave in a crib.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious (he cannot walk)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we are concerned lest his mother brought him and left him here. Rava teaches that we are not concerned, for she would not forget her son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Some goats were eating peeled barley in Neharde'a. The owner of the barley seized the goats, and was claiming a large loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel's father):</span> He can claim up to the goats' value, for he could have said that he bought them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reish Lakish taught that there is no Chazakah for Goderos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Goats are different. A shepherd watches them. (They could not walk off by themselves.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Goats walk unattended in the morning (to the shepherd's house), and return unattended at night!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are many thieves in Neharde'a, so people do not leave goats unattended.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS PLOWING A CHAZAKAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yishmael says, three months...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Tana'im argue about whether or not plowing makes a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael holds that plowing does not make a Chazakah, and R. Akiva holds that it does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why does R. Akiva require a month (in the first and third years)? One day of plowing should suffice!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rather, all agree that plowing does not make a Chazakah. They argue about whether one must eat Peros that need much time to grow, or if fast-growing Peros suffice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Plowing does not make a Chazakah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Some say, it is a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who says that it is a Chazakah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Acha;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven plowed a field (without seeding it) for two (or one) years and seeded it for one (or two) years, this is not a Chazakah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Acha says, this is a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Bivi):</span> What is R. Acha's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> An owner would not keep quiet if he saw someone plow his field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Bivi):</span> Why do Chachamim argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> An owner is very happy if others plow his field. It will be more fertile when he wants to plant!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (people of Fum Nahara):</span> Is plowing a Chazakah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> R. Acha and all the Gedolim of our generation say that it is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Many Gedolim say that it is not, e.g. Rav and Shmuel in Bavel, and R. Akiva and R. Yishmael in Eretz Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We concluded above (from the Mishnah) that R. Akiva and R. Yishmael say that it is not. What is the source that Rav agrees?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah cited Rav to say 'Chachamim argue with R. Akiva and R. Yishmael, and require three years from day to day.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he come to exclude by saying 'from day to day'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that plowing is not a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Shmuel agrees?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah cited Shmuel to say 'Chachamim argue with R. Akiva and R. Yishmael, and require three harvests of dates, three olive harvests, or three grape harvests.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT IS NEEDED FOR CHAZAKAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between Rav and Shmuel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashbam - Answer (Abaye):</span> They argue about a young date tree (it yields three harvests in less than three years. This is enough according to Shmuel, but Rav requires three full years.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Chananel - Answer (Abaye):</span> They argue about a date tree whose dates fall off. (According to Shmuel, he has no Chazakah until he stays three years and harvests three harvests; according to Rav, it suffices that he worked the field for three years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> This applies to a grain field... (regarding trees, a date harvest, an olive harvest and a grape harvest makes a Chazakah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> (Shmuel explained that Chachamim argue with R. Yishmael, but only regarding three years); we infer Chachamim's opinion from R. Yishmael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there were 30 trees, 10 per Beis Se'ah (2500 square Amos), and Reuven ate the fruit of 10 of them each year, this is a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yishmael says that eating three different fruits is a Chazakah, i.e. a Chazakah on one part of the field (e.g. where the dates grow) is a Chazakah for the whole field;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Here also, eating 10 is like using the entire property!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is only if only 10 trees produced. If more produced and he did not harvest them, this is not a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It is a Chazakah only if the 10 he ate each year are spread among the entire property.</p>
