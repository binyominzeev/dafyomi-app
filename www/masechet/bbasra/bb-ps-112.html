<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>INHERITANCE FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Yishmael need a second verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have said that perhaps a husband does not inherit his wife, and the Torah forbade a woman who inherits from marrying into a different tribe because her son (who will be of her husband's tribe) will inherit her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, he cited "v'Lo Tisov Nachalah li'Vnei Yisrael mi'Mateh El Mateh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One might have said that this does not teach that a husband inherits, rather it adds a Lav to the Isur Aseh for her to marry into another tribe;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Therefore he cited "v'Lo Tisov Nachalah mi'Mateh l'Mateh Acher."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One might have said that this comes only to add a second Lav, along with the positive Isur for her to marry into another tribe;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Therefore, he cited "v'Elazar... b'Giv'as Pinchas."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How would Pinchas have land if he did not inherit it from his father?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>One might have said that <i>Elazar</i> married a woman who inherited from her father, and Pinchas inherited his mother;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Therefore, he cited "u'Sguv Holid Es Ya'ir va'Yhi Lo Esrim v'Shalosh Arim".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps also Ya'ir inherited his mother!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, there would be two verses showing that a man inherits his mother!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps a husband does not inherit. The three verses of the Torah all discuss transfer of inheritance through the son; and Ya'ir and Pinchas bought fields!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> You cannot say that Pinchas bought a field and buried his father in it. Since the field reverts to the seller in Yovel, Elazar would be buried in someone else's land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> One could say that Pinchas received a Cherem field (it is given permanently to the Kohanim in Yovel)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN IS TRANSFER OF INHERITANCE A PROBLEM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashbam) Question (Abaye):</span> If a daughter inherited both her parents, even if she marries a man of her father's tribe, her mother's property will transfer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we are not concerned for this, since the inheritance already transferred from her mother's tribe to her father's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps we are still concerned!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Question (Abaye):</span> Even if a man does not inherit his wife, there will still be transferal of inheritance!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a daughter inherits her father and mother, and they are of different tribes, no matter who she marries, there is a transfer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(If a husband inherits his wife, we shall see that there is a way to prevent additional transfer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps we are not concerned for this, since the inheritance already transferred from her mother's tribe to her father's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> No, we are still concerned.(End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yemar):</span> We understand if we are no longer concerned. The verses of the Torah discuss transferal through the husband and the son (in both cases, it suffices to marry a man of her father's tribe);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if we are still concerned, even if she marries a man of her father's tribe, this still transfers the inheritance of her mother!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> She marries a man whose parents are from the same two tribes as her parents. When he inherits her, no additional transfer occurs.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">112b----------------------------------------112b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Torah should have commanded her to marry 'a man of the tribe of her father and mother'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said so, one would have thought that it suffices if her husband's father is from her mother's tribe, and her husband's mother is from her father's tribe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>There are two Beraisos. One first learns transfer through the son, and then transfer through the husband. The other learns in the reverse order.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "V'Lo Tisov Nachalah li'Vnei Yisrael mi'Mateh El Mateh" refers to transfer through the son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it discusses transfer through the husband!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Lo Tisov Nachalah mi'Mateh l'Mateh Acher" discusses transfer through the husband!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We must say that the first verse discusses transfer through the son.</p>
