<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA BASRA 159 - A week of learning has been dedicated towards meriting a Refu'ah Sheleimah for Eliezer Lipa ben Yetta, by Mr. and Mrs. Kornfeld of Yerushalayim. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A DIFFICULT MONETARY LAW (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Why does borrowing entitle him to take from buyers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> The teaching did not mention that anyone bought anything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction - Version #1:</span> Rather, Reuven sold his father's property in Yakov's lifetime, and Reuven died. After Yakov dies, Reuven's son (Chanoch) takes from the buyers;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This is among the most difficult monetary laws. Why can't the buyers say 'you do not inherit what your father sold!'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is not difficult! Chanoch can say 'I do not take because I inherit Reuven, rather, because I inherit Yakov.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> "Tachas Avosecha Yihyu Vanecha" (your sons will be in your father's stead, i.e. one directly inherits his grandfather if his father died first).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction - Version #2:</span> Rather, the following was considered difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If a firstborn (Reuven) sold his extra portion in Yakov's lifetime, and Reuven died, Reuven's son Chanoch takes from the buyers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is among the most difficult monetary laws. Why can't the buyers say 'you do not inherit what your father sold!'?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chanoch can say 'I do not take because I inherit Reuven, rather, because I inherit Yakov.'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The law is true even if he (Rashbam - Chanoch; R. Gershom - Yakov) is not a firstborn, surely the extra portion is due to Reuven!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is not difficult! Chanoch can say 'I inherit Yakov. I am in place of my father, therefore I get the extra portion!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction - Version #3:</span> Rather, the following was considered difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Shimon signed on a document for Moshe before Shimon stole. Later, he stole. Shimon cannot verify his signature, but others can testify about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is among the most difficult monetary laws. Since we do not trust Shimon, why does it help if others recognize his signature? (Perhaps he did not sign on the date of the document, rather, later, after he stole!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is not difficult! Perhaps the case is, we saw the signatures on the document before Shimon stole!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Correction - Version #4:</span> Rather, the following was considered difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Shimon signed on a document for Moshe before he inherited (Rashash - was standing to inherit) Moshe, then he inherited Moshe (Rashash - became his heir, e.g. Moshe's heir died). Shimon cannot verify his signature, but others can testify about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is among the most difficult monetary laws. Since we do not trust Shimon, why does it help if others recognize his signature? (Perhaps he signed after he inherited (or became an heir)!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (#1):</span> This is not difficult! Here also, the case is, we saw the signatures on the document from before this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Correction - Version #5:</span> Rather, the following was considered difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Shimon signed on a document for Moshe before he became Moshe's son-in-law, then he became his son-in-law. Shimon cannot verify his signature, but others can testify about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why does it help if others recognize his signature (perhaps he signed after he became his son-in-law!)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps here also, we saw the signatures on the document from before this!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Yosef bar Minyomi taught that the law applies even if we did not see the signatures on the document before this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is not difficult! Perhaps the Torah decreed that a relative is not believed, even though we do not suspect that he would lie! (This is also Objection #2 to Version #4.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Moshe Rabbeinu and Aharon ha'Kohen could not testify together, even though we do not suspect that they would lie. Rather, the Torah decreed that relatives are not believed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW DO GRANDCHILDREN INHERIT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Really, Version #1 was correct. (Reuven sold Yakov's property. Reuven died, and then Yakov died. Chanoch takes from the buyers. It is difficult, for they should be able to say 'you do not inherit what your father sold!')</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Tachas Avosecha Yihyu Vanecha" does not teach that a grandchild directly inherits his grandfather. Rather, it is merely a blessing (that a Tzadik will have children to inherit him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is not merely a blessing. The law is true!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">159b----------------------------------------159b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A house fell on Reuven and his father or Morishav (someone else whom Reuven inherits). Reuven left creditors (or a wife entitled to a Kesuvah). The creditors say that the father died first (and Reuven inherited him, so they may collect from the father's property). His father's heirs say that Reuven died first.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The father's heirs are Reuven's sons. 'Morishav' is Reuven's brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If a grandchild does not directly inherit his grandfather, the verse is merely a blessing. Even if Reuven died first, the creditors should collect, for the property passes to Reuven before it goes to Reuven's sons!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the father's heirs are Reuven's brothers. 'Morishav' is Reuven's uncle. (However, if the father's heirs were Reuven's sons, the creditors would collect no matter who died first.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a woman died after her son, does he 'inherit' her in the grave, i.e. to pass her property to his paternal brothers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> If a man was captured and his son died here (or vice-versa, and we do not know who died first), the father's heirs and the son's heirs divide the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is like we said, the father's heirs are also the son's heirs!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, a man was captured, and his daughter's son died here. The father's heirs and the grandson's heirs divide the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we would say that a son inherits in the grave, even if the grandson died first, he inherits his grandfather in the grave to pass the property to his paternal brothers!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We conclude that a son does not inherit in the grave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Minyomi):</span> We can also learn this from our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a house fell on Reuven and his mother, Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that his heirs divide her property with her heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a son inherits in the grave, even if the son died first, he inherits his mother to pass her property to his paternal brothers!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't a son inherit in the grave?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Torah mentions Sivah (transferal of inheritance from tribe to tribe) regarding a son and a husband (who inherit their mother and wife, respectively);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a husband in the grave does not inherit (his wife), also a son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Reuven told Shimon 'I sell to you the property of Bar Sisin's house'. There was a certain land called by that name. Reuven said that it was not Bar Sisin's, it was just called on his name.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nachman gave the land to Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Reuven was established to be the owner. To take the house from him, the burden of proof is on Shimon (that it was Bar Sisin's property)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Rav Nachman and Rava said just the contrary in a different case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Reuven (to Shimon):</span> What are you doing in this house?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> I bought it from you, and I have lived here the years needed to make a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> (I did not sell it to you.) I have been living in the inner rooms of the house (so you have no Chazakah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> (To get the house,) Shimon must prove that he was alone in the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Shimon has a Chazakah. To take the house from him, the burden of proof is on Reuven (to prove that he lived in the inner rooms)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of contradiction:</span> In the first case, Rav Nachman considers the buyer to be Muchzak, and Rava says that the seller is Muchzak. In the latter case, each holds the opposite!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> Rava does not contradict himself. In the first case, the seller is on the property, so he is Muchzak;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the second case, the buyer is on the property, so he is Muchzak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> Rav Nachman does not contradict himself. In the first case, since the property is called by Bar Sisin's name, the seller must prove that it was not really Bar Sisin's;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the second case, living in the house for the years of Chazakah only supports his claim that he had a document and lost it. Even if he had the document, he would have to validate it! (Here also, he must prove that his Chazakah was valid.)</p>
