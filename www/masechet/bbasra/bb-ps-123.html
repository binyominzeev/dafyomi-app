<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE EXTRA PORTION OF A FIRSTBORN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Lases Lo Pi Shnayim" - he gets twice what a regular brother receives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he receives two (thirds) of all the property!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is reasonable that he gets twice the share of a regular brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A firstborn's share when he has one brother should resemble his share when he has five brothers. In each case, he gets twice the share of a regular brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We can say otherwise. Just like when he has one brother he gets two thirds of the estate, also when he has five brothers!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "B'Yom Hanchilo Es Banav" is extra, to increase the inheritance of the other sons (i.e. the firstborn only gets twice the share of a regular brother).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Reuven Bechor Yisrael... Nitenah Bechoraso li'Vnei Yosef v'Lo Lehisyaches la'Bechorah" (Yosef would not be called firstborn, just he would receive a double portion. He received twice the portion of a regular brother.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "Veha'Bechorah l'Yosef" - just like Yosef's Bechorah entitled him to twice the portion of a regular brother, also firstborns in all generations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> "Nosati Lecha Shechem Achad Al Achecha Asher Lokachti mi'Yad ha'Emori b'Charbi uv'Kashti (with my sword and bow)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yakov didn't get these through his weapons - "Ki Lo v'Kashti Evtach v'Charbi Lo Soshi'eni"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Charbi means prayer, and Kashti means request.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why were additional answers needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One could reject the first answer. Perhaps "b'Yom Hanchilo Es Banav" teaches R. Yochanan ben Brokah's law (that one may give his entire inheritance to one heir). Therefore, we bring a proof from "Reuven... (Bechoraso li'Vnei Yosef)".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One could reject also this proof. Perhaps we cannot learn Bechorah from that verse, for it says "Bechora<i>so</i>" (this is not the same word)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, we bring a proof from "veha'Bechorah l'Yosef."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One could reject this, and say that Yosef himself received two thirds of all the property. Therefore, we bring "Nosati Lecha Shechem Achad Al Achecha".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps Yosef only received an extra date tree!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> "Efrayim u'Mnashe ki'Reuven v'Shimon Yihyu Li".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>GIVING THE BECHORAH TO YOSEF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chelbo):</span> Why did Yakov take the Bechorah from Reuven and give it to Yosef?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse explicitly says why it was taken from Reuven - "uv'Chalelo Yetzu'ei Aviv"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The question was, why did he give it to Yosef?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> We learn from a parable. A man raised an orphan in his home. Later, the orphan became rich; he decided to give some of his wealth to the man who raised him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Chelbo):</span> (According to your parable,) had Reuven not sinned, Yakov would not have given anything extra to Yosef!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yonason):</span> The Bechorah was fitting to come from Rachel - "Eleh Toledos Yakov Yosef";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Through prayer, Leah merited to bear the firstborn. Hash-m returned the Bechorah to Rachel to reward for her modesty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we see that Le'ah merited through prayer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Einei Le'ah Rachos".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Her eyes were teary.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Torah elaborated to say "ha'Behemah Asher Einenah Tehorah" to avoid using a derogatory expression (Tamei) for Tamei animals. Surely it would not speak to the detriment of Tzadikim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> Her gifts (Kehunah, Levi'yah and kingship were given to her children) are Aruchos (lasting).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav):</span> Really, it means that her eyes were weak. This is praiseworthy!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>She heard people talking on the crossroads that Lavan's daughters will marry Rivkah's sons. The elder (Esav) will marry the elder (Leah), and the younger (Yakov) will marry the younger (Rachel).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>She asked about the brothers. They told her that the elder is an evil robber, and the younger is a Tzadik who constantly learns.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>She cried until her eyelashes fell out - "va'Yar Hash-m Ki Senu'ah Leah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> She was hated.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Torah avoided using a derogatory expression for Tamei animals. Would it speak to the detriment of Tzadikim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Hash-m saw that Esav's deeds were hateful to her, so He gave to her children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What modesty did Rachel demonstrate?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Yaged Yakov l'Rachel Ki Achi Aviha Hu..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Really, he is the son (not the brother) of her father's sister!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When he told her to marry him, she agreed, but warned him that her father is a trickster, and Yakov cannot overcome him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Yakov:</span> What is his trickery?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rachel:</span> I have an older sister. He will not marry me off before her.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Yakov:</span> I am your father's brother in trickery.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Rachel:</span> May Tzadikim use trickery?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Yakov:</span> Yes! "Im Navar Titavar v'Im Ikesh Titapal."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Yakov gave to her a code. When she saw that Le'ah was being brought to the Chupah, she reasoned that Le'ah will not know the code, Yakov will protest, and Le'ah will be embarrassed. She gave the code to Le'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> "Va'Yhi va'Boker v'Hinei Hi Le'ah".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that until the morning, she was not Le'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Due to the code that Rachel gave to Le'ah, Yakov did not know that she was Le'ah until morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Aba Chalifa Karviya):</span> The Torah says that Yakov descended to Miztrayim with 70 people. When you count them there are only 69!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> A twin sister was born with Dinah - "v'Es Dinah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Aba Chalifa):</span> If so, you should also say that a twin was born with Binyamin - "v'Es Binyamin"!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">123b----------------------------------------123b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> I had a gem (a precious teaching), and you want me to lose (publicize) it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chiya citing R. Chama bar Chanina):</span> The 70th is Yocheved, who was born between the walls.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Asher Yaldah Osah l'Levi b'Mitzrayim" - Yocheved was born in Mitzrayim, but not conceived there (she was conceived on the way).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chelbo):</span> "Ka'asher Yoldah Rachel Es Yosef" - what was special about Yosef (that Yakov now wanted to leave)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Yakov saw that the seed of Esav will be defeated only by the seed of Yosef - "v'Hayah Veis Yakov Esh u'Veis Yosef Lehavah u'Veis Esav l'Kash."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yakem David meha'Neshef v'Ad ha'Erev" (David is from Yehudah, and Amalek is from Esav)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shmuel bar Nachmani:</span> You learned the Nevi'im (from which you asked this question) but not Kesuvim (a verse answers your question)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "B'Lechto El Tzikelag Nafelu Alav (to help David) mi'Menasheh..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> "Min Benei Shimon...Benei Yish'i b'Rosham. Va'Yaku Es She'eris ha'Peletah la'Amalek..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Shilo):</span> Yish'i descended from Menasheh - "Roshei Veis Avosam (of Menasheh) v'Efer v'Yish'i..." (Maharsha - presumably, this is the source. What is cited in the Gemara is not a verse.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IN WHAT DOES A FIRSTBORN RECEIVE A DOUBLE SHARE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A firstborn receives a double portion in Matanos (when one slaughters a Chulin animal, he gives the foreleg, jaw and stomach to a Kohen), and in Kodshim; and in Shevach (the increased value of the property after the father's death).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the father left a cow with others, and he was a partner in the profits, or he rented it to others, or it was grazing in the pasture and it gave birth, the firstborn gets an extra share in the profits, rental or calf;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the orphans built houses or planted vineyards, the firstborn does not get a double share in them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of the Matanos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If the father already received them, clearly, the firstborn gets a double share in them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If the father did not receive them, they are only Ra'uy (destined to come to the father), and the firstborn has no extra share in such property, only what was Muchzak to the father when he died!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Ploni (a Yisrael who regularly gives Matanos to the father) slaughtered the animal in the father's lifetime</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana holds that Matanos that were not yet separated, are considered as if they were separated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he get an extra share of Kodshim? They do not belong to the father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they are Kodshim Kalim (those that become permitted even to a non-Kohen); the Tana holds like R. Yosi ha'Galili, who says that Kodshim Kalim are the property of the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> "U'Mo'alah Ma'al ba'Shem" includes Kodshim Kalim, which are the property of the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the father left a cow with others in which he was a partner in the profits, or he rented it to others, or it was grazing in the pasture and it gave birth, the firstborn gets an extra share in the profits, rental or calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he gets an extra share in profits from a cow with others, there is no need to say that he gets an extra share in profits of a cow in the pasture!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The last clause teaches about the previous clauses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When grazing in the pasture, the Shevach comes by itself; he need not pay for the food. Similarly, the case when it is with others and he shares the profits, or receives rental, is when the father was not obligated to pay for the food.</p>
