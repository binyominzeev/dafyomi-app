<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ARVUS AND KABLANUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If Levi told Reuven 'lend to Shimon and I will be an Arev', 'lend to him and I will pay', 'lend to him and I am liable'; or 'lend to him and I will give', Levi becomes an Arev;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'give to him and I will be a Kablan', 'give to him and I will pay', 'give to him and I am liable'; or 'give to him and I will give', he becomes a Kablan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he said 'lend to to him and I will be a Kablan', or 'give to him and I will be an Arev', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> If he said that he will be an Arev, he is an Arev (whether he said 'give' or 'lend'), if he said that he will be a Kablan, he is a Kablan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> In all of Rav Huna's cases he becomes a Kablan, except for 'lend to him and I will be an Arev'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> In all of Rav Huna's cases he becomes an Arev, except for 'give to him and I will give'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mar bar Ameimar):</span> If he said 'give to him and I will give', Reuven cannot claim from Shimon (the borrower).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is wrong. Shimon is exempt only if the Arev took the money from the lender. (Then, the Arev is the borrower, even though the Arev immediately gave the money to Shimon.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A case occurred in which a judge gave the borrower's property to the lender before the lender claimed from the borrower; Rav Chanin brei d'Rav Yeva removed the judge.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Rav Chanin acted properly. He holds that one's property is an Arev for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven lent to Shimon, and Levi was an Arev, Reuven may not collect from Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This means, he may not collect from the Arev first.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>AN AREV DOES NOT COLLECT FROM ORPHANS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A case occurred in which Levi was an Arev for Shimon. Shimon died, and Levi paid the lender before informing Shimon's orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> (The orphans now owe Levi.) Paying a creditor is a Mitzvah. The orphans are not obligated in Mitzvos (until they become adults).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> The orphans do not pay. We are concerned for Tzrari (perhaps their father gave money to Reuven, in order that Reuven will not ask the Arev to pay).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">174b----------------------------------------174b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If Shimon admitted, just before he died, that he did not pay (we are not concerned for Tzrari. Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua obligates the orphans in this case).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Shimon was put in Niduy (excommunication) for refusal to pay, and he died in Niduy (we are not concerned for Tzrari).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> If Shimon died in Niduy, the Halachah follows Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua. (Rashbam - the orphans must pay. We do not exempt them because they are exempt from Mitzvos; R. Chananel - we are concerned for Tzrari. Perhaps Shimon died before asking for the Niduy to be lifted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If an Arev was holding a loan document (on which he was an Arev), he cannot collect from the borrower's orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the lender (Rashbam; Tosfos – borrower) signed 'I received the money from you', [the Areiv] collects.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We understand according to Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua. The case is, the borrower admitted that he did not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>However, according to Rav Papa, the orphans are exempt from Mitzvos. They need not pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because he signed 'I received the money from you', the Arev is now like a creditor with a document, so he collects from orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Shimon borrowed from a Nochri, and died. Levi was an Arev. Levi paid the lender before he claimed from Shimon's orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mordechai):</span> Even Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua is concerned for Tzrari only when the lender is a Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Nochri would claim from the Arev even if he was paid, so we are not concerned for Tzrari.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> Just the contrary! Even Rav Papa is concerned for Tzrari when the lender is a Nochri!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since Nochrim claim from the Arev first, surely Shimon gave Tzrari <i>to Levi</i> to make him agree to be an Arev!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AN AREV FOR A KESUVAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if Yehudah was an Arev for a Kesuvah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Moshe bar Atzri was an Arev for his daughter-in-law's Kesuvah. His son, Rav Huna, was a very poor Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Why doesn't someone suggest to Rav Huna to divorce his wife, she will collect her Kesuvah, and he can remarry her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> He must vow that he will not benefit from her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He can divorce her outside of Beis Din. Perhaps the father will pay without making him vow!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It became known that Rav Huna was a Kohen (who cannot marry a divorcee), so the scheme was not feasible.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Poverty clings to the poor (they do not easily escape it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could Abaye have suggested such a scheme?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> A crafty Rasha is one who counsels (one who received a gift on condition that it will pass to someone else after him) to sell it, according to R. Shimon ben Gamliel (that the sale works).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was different, for the father's money would go to his son. Also, the son was a Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Halachah is that an Arev for a Kesuvah is not obligated (this will be explained later)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The father was a Kablan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that a Kablan for a Kesuvah is obligated;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that a Kablan for a Kesuvah is not obligated unless the husband had property, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, Rav Huna had property (when his father became a Kablan), and later it was flooded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> A father obligates himself for his son (even if the son has no property).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>All agree that an Arev for a Kesuvah is not obligated;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>All agree that a Kablan for a loan is obligated;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>They argue about a Kablan for a Kesuvah and an Arev for a loan. One opinion says that the Kablan (Arev) is obligated only if the husband (borrower) has property;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>The other opinion says that in either case, he is obligated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>The Halachah is, an Arev is obligated whether or not the borrower has property, except for an Arev for a Kesuvah, who is never obligated;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he not obligated for a Kesuvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He gets no benefit. He thinks 'I am doing a Mitzvah (to help them get married). She is not losing anything (she prefers to be married, even if there is no guarantor for her Kesuvah).' The Arev has no real intent to pay.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DO WE BELIEVE A SHECHIV MERA?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If a Shechiv Mera (one who fears lest he die from his illness) was Makdish all his property, and later said '100 Zuz in my possession really belongs to Ploni', he is believed. There is a Chazakah that people do not scheme to cheat Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> Do people scheme to cheat their children?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> If a Shechiv Mera said '100 Zuz in my possession really belongs to Ploni', we give to Ploni only if he said 'give it to Ploni.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(This is not a scheme to cheat his children. Rather,) one does not want people to think that his children are wealthy, so we suspect that he is lying;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Likewise, when he was Makdish, we should be concerned lest he did not have Ploni's money, just he did not want people to think that he himself is wealthy!</p>
