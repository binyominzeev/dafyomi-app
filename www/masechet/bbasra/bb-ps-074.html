<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TRAVELS OF CHACHAMIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The guide showed us those who died in the wilderness. Their faces were happy like drunkards. They were sleeping with their faces up [showing that they trusted in Hash-m]. One had his knees bent. Our guide passed underneath, riding a camel and holding a spear, without touching him. (Etz Yosef - Zimri's knees were bent. Eliyahu (Pinchas) killed him with a spear, and no one was able to touch (i.e. stop) him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>I cut the corner of one of their garments, with Tzitzis on it. We (the animals we were riding on) were unable to travel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The guide:</span> Did you take something from them? Return it, for one who takes something from them is unable to go [Hash-m swore that they will not enter Eretz Yisrael. This applies even to their garments.]</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>I returned it, and we were able to proceed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When I returned, Rabanan rebuked me. 'You cut the corner in order to determine whether the Halachah follows Beis Shamai or Beis Hillel. You should have counted the number of strings and knots!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">The guide showed us Har Sinai:</span> It was surrounded by scorpions, guarding it like white donkeys [allusions to Chachamim].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">A voice from Heaven:</span> Woe to Me that I swore. Now that I swore, who will permit My oath?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When I returned, Rabanan rebuked me. 'You should have permitted Hash-m's oath (Tosfos - that those who died in the wilderness will not enter Eretz Yisrael; Rashbam - that Yisrael will be in Galus.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rabah bar bar Chanah thought that Hash-m referred to His oath not to flood the world again.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rabanan reason that Hash-m would not regret that oath so much.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The guide showed us where Korach and his cohorts were swallowed. There were two crevices. Smoke was exuding. He soaked wool in water, put it on the end of a spear and put it inside. It became singed. I was able to hear them saying 'Moshe and his Torah are true, and they (Korach and his congregation) are liars.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The guide:</span> Every 30 days Gehinom returns them to here, like meat in a frying pan, and they say this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The guide showed us where Heaven touches earth [where prayer can change one's Mazel]. I put my [prayer for] bread in the window. After praying, I did not find it [that my prayer was answered]. I thought this was due to thieves [who blocked my prayer]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The guide:</span> No. The sphere (on which the constellations are fixed) moved. You will find it [that your Mazel has changed] tomorrow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> I was on a ship, and saw a fish [the Mazel of Adar] take its head out of the water. Its eyes were like moons. Water {Torah) came from its two nostrils like rivers of Sura (Etz Yosef - due to the birth of Moshe and the second acceptance of the Torah (in the days of Mordechai), which were in Adar.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Safra:</span> I was on a ship, and I saw a horned fish (ha'Kosev (in Ein Yakov) - a kindgom). Engraved on the horn it said 'I am a small sea creature. I am 300 Parsa'os. I will fall into the mouth of Livyasan (Edom, to which most kingdoms will be drawn).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> That was the sea-goat. It digs with its horns to seek food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> I was on a ship, and I saw a chest with precious gems. A fish surrounded it. An expert swimmer descended to take it. The fish sought to bite his leg. He threw vinegar at it, and it fled.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">74b----------------------------------------74b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">A voice from Heaven:</span> That chest is for the wife of R. Chanina ben Dosa [who convinced her husband not to take any of their reward in this world]. She will put in it Techeiles for Tzadikim in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah Hindu'ah:</span> I was on a ship, and I saw a gem (Torah). A giant crocodile was by it. A swimmer came to take it, and the crocodile sought to swallow the ship. A raven came and cut off its head. The sea turned red from all the blood. Another crocodile took the stone, and hung it on the dead crocodile; it revived, and sought to swallow the ship again. The raven cut off its head again, and threw the gem into our ship.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We had some salted birds. We put the gem on them, and they revived, took the gem and flew away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua were on a ship. R. Eliezer was sleeping. R. Yehoshua was agitated, and woke R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> What agitated you?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> I saw a great light! (Iyun Yakov - he thought it was the light at the head of a great wave ready to sink the ship (73a).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Perhaps it was the eyes of Livyasan - "v'Einav k'Afapei Shachar."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Huna bar Noson was traveling in the wilderness. They had a thigh of meat. They opened it, removed the Chelev and Gid ha'Nasheh, and put it on grass. By the time they gathered firewood, the thigh had closed up.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The next year, they returned and saw that the coals were still burning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Ameimar:</span> That was Samterei grass (which constricts; R. Gershom - a life-giving drug) and Risma coals (which burn a long time).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Bavel):</span> "Va'Yivra Elokim Es ha'Taninim ha'Gedolim" refers to Re'emim (giant creatures) of the sea.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It refers to the male Livyasan, which is straight as a bolt; and the female Livyasan, which surrounds the world - "...Livyasan Nachash Bari'ach v'Al Livyasan Nachash Akalason".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LIVYASAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>[The simple meaning of these accounts is also true.]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Hash-m created all creatures male and female, also a male Livyasan (Rashba, Chidushei Agados - intellect) and female (Nefesh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the male and female Livyasan would mate (all would be according to Sechel (intellect)), the world would be desolate (no one would have children). Therefore, Hash-m castrated the male (Rashbam - lest it mate with other fish, or be pained by unfulfilled lust) and killed and salted the female for Tzadikim to eat (Rashba - to draw close to Hash-m; Shitah - it will sustain every Tzadik, joining his Nefesh and body, so it will not return to dirt) in the world to come - "v'Harag Es ha'Tanin Asher ba'Yam."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also the giant Behemos of Harerei Elef (Resha'im) would destroy the world if they would mate. Hash-m cooled (removed lust from) the female (physical bodies) and castrated the male (their forms) - "Hinei Kocho v'Masnav v'Ono bi'Shriri Vitno."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't He likewise cool the female Livyasan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Fish are different. They are lewd. (Iyun Yakov - even though they are naturally cold. Shita - if the castrated male would see the female, he would destroy the world).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't He kill the male and castrate the female?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A salted female is better (Shita - the flesh is fatter).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Livyasan Zeh Yatzarta Lesachek Bo" - it is improper to frolic with a female.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't He likewise salt the female giant Behemah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Salted fish is good, but salted meat is not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SEAS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> When Hash-m wanted to create the world, he told the Sar of (angel appointed over) the sea to open its mouth and swallow all the (Ben Yehoyada - evaporate the excess) water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The Sar:</span> It is enough that I swallow my water!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hash-m kicked it (made it physical) and killed it - "b'Kocho Raga ha'Yam uvi'Svunaso Machatz Rahav";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> This teaches that the Sar of the sea was called Rahav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the water would not cover it, no creature could stand its smell - "ka'Mayim la'Yam Mechasim";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We understand this, it covers the Sar of the Yam. (R. Yitzchak E. Chaver - the Sar is the evil inclination. Hash-m asked it to contain all illusory temptations. It refused. It wanted to dominate this world. Hash-m reduced its power. This is called 'killing' it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Yarden emanates from the Pamyus cave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Yarden emanates from the Pamyus cave (Rashba - the Nefesh is a emanation; its first source is Sechel of Hash-m), passes through the seas of Sivki and Tiveryah, goes to the Yam ha'Gadol (where it becomes a Nefesh) and enters the mouth of Livyasan - "Yivtach Ki Yagi'ach Yarden El Pihu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Ula):</span> That refers to animals (physical bodies)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that animals are secure until the Yarden enters the mouth of Livyasan. (Ha'Kosev - the Nochrim are not worried as long as Yisrael is in exile, for they will not be judged until Mashi'ach comes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Dimi):</span> What does it mean "Ki Hu Al Yamim Yesadah v'Al Neharos Yechoneneha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These are the seven seas and four rivers that encompass Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The seas are Tiveryah, Sedom, Chilas, Chilta, Sivki, Aspamya and Yam ha'Gadol;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The rivers are Yarden, Yarmoch, Kidomiyon, and Pigah.</p>
