<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA BASRA 127 (4 Sivan) - Dedicated by Mr. David Kornfeld in memory of the members of his family, Hashem Yikom Damam, who perished at the hands of the Nazi murderers in the Holocaust. (The exact date of their passing is not known; their Yahrzeit is observed on 4 Sivan.) May our Torah learning and teaching be l'Iluy Nishmas Mr. Kornfeld's mother (Mirel bas Yakov Mordechai), brothers (Shraga Feivel, Aryeh Leib and Yisachar Dov, sons of Mordechai), grandfather (Reb Yakov Mordechai ben David - Shpira) and aunt (Charne bas Yakov Mordechai - wife of Reb Moshe Aryeh Cohen z'l). </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A TUMTUM THAT WAS TORN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> If he steals (twice) from his parents to buy meat and wine, he is not killed. "Ki <i>Yihyeh l'Ish</i> Ben Sorer u'Moreh" - he must be (recognizably) a son from his birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> (If he was not the firstborn,) he does not count like a son to diminish the extra portion of the firstborn. (E.g. if there are three normal sons, the firstborn gets an added quarter, and all the sons divide the remaining property equally. "V'Yoldu Lo Banim" - we consider sons recognizable from birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shizbi):</span> He is not circumcised on the eighth day (if it falls on Shabbos). "V'Yoldah Zachar... uva'Yom ha'Shemini Yimol" applies only if he was (recognizably) male from birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sharbiya):</span> His mother is not Temei'ah like one who gave birth to a male. "V'Yoldah Zachar v'Tam'ah Shiv'as Yomim..." applies only if he was (recognizably) male from birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Sharbiya - Mishnah):</span> If a woman miscarried a Tumtum or Androginus (one with male and female genitals), she is doubtfully Temei'ah like one who is unsure if she gave birth to a male or female.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refutes Rav Sharbiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This also refutes Rav Shizbi! (He expounded just like Rav Sharbiya.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Tana is unsure whether we require a male recognizable from birth regarding circumcision and Tum'ah. He is stringent about both (therefore, we do not circumcise the baby on Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, (perhaps the special laws of Tum'ah of childbirth (that for 33 or 66 days after her Tum'ah, any blood she sees is Tahor) do not apply, so) she should be is doubtfully Temei'ah like one who is unsure if she gave birth to a male or female, or a regular Nidah (due to the blood that came out during the birth)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Ami - Beraisa):</span> (Bechorah applies to a normal) "Ben", but not to a Tumtum. It applies to "Bechor", but not to a Safek (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SAFEK FIRSTBORNS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, '"Ben", but not a Tumtum' teaches about R. Ami's case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the case of '"Bechor", but not a Safek? (Obviously, a Safek firstborn does not receive a double portion!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches about Rava's case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven's two wives gave birth, and it was not known who gave birth first (one of the sons is the firstborn) one writes a Harsha'ah (power of attorney) to the other. ('If I am the firstborn, you may take my extra portion.' This enables the other to take the extra portion (and they split it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> R. Yanai taught that if it was once known which was the firstborn, and then it was forgotten, one writes a Harsha'ah to the other. If it was never known which the firstborn was, Harsha'ah does not help.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rava publicized his mistake and taught like R. Yanai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (people of Akra):</span> If the Chazakah was that Shimon was Levi's firstborn, and Levi said that Yehudah is his firstborn, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> One writes a Harsha'ah to the other, and they divide the extra portion.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">127b----------------------------------------127b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> No matter how he holds, this is difficult!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he holds like Chachamim (in the coming Beraisa), Shimon gets the extra portion. If he holds like R. Yehudah, Yehudah gets it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel is unsure if the Halachah follows Chachamim or R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Yakir" - he will inform others (who is his firstborn). This teaches that a man is believed to say who his firstborn is;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(If he is a Kohen,) just like he is believed to say who is his firstborn, he is believed to say that a certain son was born to a divorcee or Chalutzah (and is disqualified from Kehunah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he is not believed (about either of these).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> According to Chachamim, what do we learn from "Yakir"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It teaches about when we need the father to identify the firstborn (we have no Chazakah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this needed in order to give to him an extra portion? A man can give his money to whomever he wants!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He must establish him to be the firstborn in order that the son will receive an extra portion in money that the father will receive (after his declaration).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Meir, one can transfer ownership of something that is not yet in the world. He can give now an extra portion in money he will get later. Why do we need the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It enables him to give an extra portion in property that the father will receive when he is Goses (close to death, and unable to transfer ownership, therefore he cannot give now what he will receive then).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the Chazakah was that Shimon was Levi's firstborn, and Levi said that Yehudah is his firstborn, he is believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Chazakah was that Shimon is not Levi's firstborn, and Levi said that he is, he is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>The Reisha is like R. Yehudah, and the Seifa is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS ONE BELIEVED TO RETRACT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one said 'this is my son', and later said 'he is my slave', he is not believed (to retract. One would not call a slave 'my son');</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'he is my slave', and retracted and said 'he is my son', he is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(The first time) he meant 'he serves me like a slave.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The law is the opposite in the place where they collect taxes from slave owners. If he said 'he is my son', and (later, where they do not collect taxes) said 'he is my slave', he is believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'he is my slave', and later said 'he is my son', he is not believed (he would lie to evade the tax, but not to falsely obligate himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven was serving Shimon like a son, and Shimon said 'he is my son', and later said 'he is my slave', he is not believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was serving him like a slave, and Shimon said 'he is my slave', and retracted and said 'he is my son', he is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The case is, he called him a '100 Metzar slave'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is like land worth 100 Dinarim. (One would not say this about his son.)</p>
