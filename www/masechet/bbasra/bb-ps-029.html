<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SOURCE OF THREE YEARS OF CHAZAKAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Perhaps (a Chazakah can be made in less time). That was only good counsel (to keep a signed document, since witnesses of Chazakah are not always available).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Yirmeyahu also told them to build houses, plant gardens and eat the fruits. Clearly, that was merely good counsel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, getting signed documents of sale was only good counsel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also "u'Nsatem bi'Chli Cheres l'Ma'an Ya'amdu Yamim Rabim" is only a good counsel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> (Human nature dictates that three years are needed for Chazakah, for) one pardons someone else who uses his property for one or two years, but not for three years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> If so, one who only had one or two years of Chazakah, when the land returns to the original owner, the one who used the land should not have to pay for the fruits!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nachman taught that he must pay for the fruits!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> Rather, one does not begrudge one who uses his property for one or two years (nor does he pardon the fruits). He begrudges one who uses it for three years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> People such as those of Bar Elyashiv's family begrudge even one who passes by the border of their property. According to Rava, someone who uses their property should immediately get a Chazakah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If you will say this is correct, the time needed for Chazakah varies (based on the original owner)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Rather, one is careful with his document (of purchase) only up to three years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, a Macha'ah (the Muchzak announces that the Machazik does not own the land he is using) not in front of the Machazik should be invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Machazik can claim, had you told me of your claim, I would have guarded my document longer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The ones who heard the Macha'ah surely told their friends, who surely told their friends ... (surely, the Machazik found out).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CONDITIONS OF CHAZAKAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The three years of Chazakah must be consecutive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know this from our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Chazakah is three years, from day to day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that this only comes to exclude incomplete years, but the years can be intermittent. Rav Huna teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chama):</span> Rav Huna agrees that in a place where people normally leave a field fallow every other year, intermittent years make a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, some people alternate years, others do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that the Muchzak can claim 'if you really own the field, you should have used it every year.' He teaches that this is not so;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Machazik can answer 'I cannot afford someone to watch my field alone when all the neighbors are leaving their fields fallow.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Alternatively, he can say 'I left it fallow this year, so it will produce more next year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A Chazakah on houses...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Presumably,) witnesses would know only whether someone used the house during the day, but not whether he used it at night! (This is like an intermittent Chazakah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Neighbors testify to a Chazakah on houses, and they know who used it by day and by night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Renters can testify that they lived there three years, by day and night, and paid rent to the Machazik.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yemar):</span> Renters are invalid as witnesses, for they are partial. If they would not testify for the Machazik, they would need to pay the original owner for having lived there!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> That is true. Only incompetent judges would accept such testimony!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, the case is that the renters did not yet pay the Machazik; they are ready to pay whomever Beis Din declares to be the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> The original owner can ask the Machazik to bring witnesses that he was there day and night; if he cannot, the Chazakah is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Mar Zutra agrees that if the Muchzak is a peddler who goes from city to city, the Machazik must bring witnesses that he was there day and night, even if the Muchzak does not request this (for he was not present to see the Machazik living there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav Huna admits about a store in a city that it is normally used only by day (day usage suffices for a Chazakah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rami bar Chama and Rav Ukva bar Chama bought a slave in partnership. One of them used her in years one, three and five, and the other used her in years two, four and six. Someone else claimed that he owned her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> You alternated using her so that neither of you would get a Chazakah against his brother (and be able to claim he owns her himself). Similarly, neither of you has a Chazakah against others!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This applies only if they did not write a document of the partnership. If they wrote one, people hear about this (and the brothers have a Chazakah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a Machazik used all of a field except for a Beis Rova (the area in which one sows a quarter Kav of grain, about 104 square Amos), this is a Chazakah in the part he used.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> This applies only if the unused part is farmable. If not, the Chazakah works for the entire field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> The only way to make a Chazakah on a rocky (unfarmable) field is to graze animals or spread fruits on it. Here also, to acquire the unfarmable part he must do this!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN IS THE BUYER MUCHZAK IN THE PROPERTY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Reuven asked Shimon:</span> What are you doing in this house?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> I bought it from you, and I have lived here the years needed to make a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> (I did not sell it to you.) I have been living in the inner rooms of the house (so you do not have a Chazakah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> (To get the house) Shimon must prove that he was alone in the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Shimon has a Chazakah. To take the house from him, the burden of proof is on Reuven (to prove that he lived in the inner rooms)!</p>
