<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES A MOTHER INHERIT HER SON? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> The following bequeath but do not inherit: a woman to her sons, a woman to her husband, and a man to his sister's children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah b'Rebbi Shimon:</span> I do not know who taught our Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say that it is R. Zecharyah ben ha'Katzav, who does not expound "Matos"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot establish our Mishnah like R. Zecharyah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (The following inherit but do not bequeath)... sons of sisters.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A man inherits his mother's sister, but a woman does not inherit her mother's sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Beraisa exclude 'a woman from her mother's sister'?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> If she has brothers, they inherit before her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Culmination of answer:</span> According to R. Zecharyah, a woman inherits her mother equally with her brothers!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the Tana of our Mishnah expound?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he expounds "Matos", a woman should inherit her son!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he does not expound "Matos", how does he know that a son inherits before a daughter in the mother's property?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he expounds "Matos". A daughter does not inherit with a son in their mother's property, for it says "v'Chol Bas <i>Yoreshes</i> Nachalah (mi'Matos)" - she inherits two Matos (if she had no brothers, and her mother was from a different tribe than her father, but she does not bequeath to two Matos (a son and a daughter).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE ORDER OF INHERITANCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The order of inheritance: "Ish Ki Yamus u'Ven Ein Lo v'Ha'avarta Es Nachalso l'Vito" - a son precedes a daughter, and all the descendants of a son precede a daughter;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A daughter precedes the brother of the deceased, and all her descendants precede a brother;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A brother precedes the brothers of the father, and all his descendants precede the father's brothers;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The general rule is, whoever has precedence to inherit, all his descendants have precedence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Question:</span> Perhaps "u'Ven" teaches only a son (that he inherits before a daughter)! What is the source for the son or daughter or grandson of a son? (E.g. if Dosan died before his father Eli'av, and, Dosan left a son or daughter or grandson, Dosan's descendant inherits Eli'av, and Eli'av's daughters do not inherit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ein Lo" - we read this 'Ayen' (investigate).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Vas" teaches only a daughter (she inherits before the father and brothers of the Mes)! What is the source for the son or daughter or granddaughter of a daughter?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We read "Ein Lo" like 'Ayen'.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">115b----------------------------------------115b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Just like we look for descendants, we also look for ancestors. (If Dosan left no descendants, and there are no living descendants to his father, we look for his father's father (or his descendants)... even if we must go until Reuven (ben Yakov Avinu).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not say 'even if we must go until Yakov'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Tradition teaches that no tribe will ever die out (we will never need to go back to Yakov).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If anyone says that a daughter inherits with a daughter of a son, even if the Nasi says so, we do not heed him, for this is what Tzedukim say.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Teves 24 is the holiday of returning to the original law (we may not fast or eulogize on this day);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Tzedukim used to say that a daughter inherits with a daughter of a son. R. Yochanan ben Zakai challenged their source. A lone Tzeduki responded.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The Tzeduki:</span> We learn from a Kal va'Chomer. A son's daughter inherits due to her father (the son of the deceased), and she inherits (with surviving sons). A daughter inherits due to herself, so all the more so she inherits with sons!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> It says "Eleh Benei Se'ir... Yoshevei ha'Aretz... v'Tzivon va'Anah", and it says "v'Eleh Benei Tzivon v'Ayah va'Anah"! (Rashbam - Anah inherited with his uncles from his grandfather. This shows that a son's descendants inherit just like he would have inherited. Since a daughter does not inherit with a son, she does not inherit with a son's daughter! Tosfos - Anah was a girl. We will explain the proof soon.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We must say that Tzivon fathered Anah through his own mother (therefore, Anah is also listed among children of Se'ir).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps there were two people named Anah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> "Hu Anah" - this is the same Anah listed above.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">The Tzeduki:</span> How does that refute me?! (Tosfos - he did not understand R. Yochanan's intent.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> This shows that a son's daughter inherits with other sons of the deceased, but a daughter does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>The Tzedukim were defeated. Chachamim made the day a holiday.</p>
