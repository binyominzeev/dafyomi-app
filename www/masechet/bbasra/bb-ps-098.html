<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RESPONSIBILITY FOR SOLD WINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sold wine to Shimon and it soured, Reuven is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is known that Reuven's wine sours, the sale is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven said that the wine is scented, it must last until Shavu'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>'Old wine' is from the previous year;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>'Aged wine' must be in its third year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> This is only if the wine was put in Shimon's Keli, but if it remained in Reuven's Kelim, he is responsible (his wine or Kelim are to blame)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shimon is to blame for not drinking the wine sooner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he asked to buy wine for cooking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina establish the Mishnah when it was put in Shimon's Keli and he asked to buy wine for cooking? He should establish it to discuss Reuven's Keli, and Shimon did not ask to buy wine for cooking!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah was difficult. It says, if it is known that Reuven's wine sours, the sale is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon is to blame for not drinking the wine sooner!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We must say that he asked to buy wine for cooking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina argues with Rav Chiya bar Yosef.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chiya bar Yosef):</span> "Ha'Yayin Boged Gever Yahir" - wine spoils due to its owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mari):</span> A haughty person is disgraceful even in the eyes of his household - "Gever Yahir v'Lo Yinveh".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Lo Yinveh" hints at people of his Naveh (home).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one (who is not a Chacham) wears the Talis of a Chacham (it totally covers his cloak), he does not enter Hash-m's place;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says here "v'Lo Yinveh", just like "El Neve Kodshecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven sold a barrel of wine to a grocer (Shimon) in order to sell it over time (Tosfos; Rashbam - the grocer is merely a Shali'ach to sell Reuven's wine for him) and it spoiled, Reuven suffers the entire loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if Shimon did not make a new spout. If he did, it is his fault.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is only if the market day did not come yet. If it did, Shimon is at fault (he should have sold it then).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven gave wine to Shimon to take to a certain place to sell it, and the price declined by the time he arrived, Reuven suffers the entire loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it soured, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav Hillel):</span> Shimon shares the loss (it spoiled due to both of them). This is unlike R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina (who blames the spoilage on the owner of the wine and Kelim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rav Hillel):</span> Reuven bears the entire loss, like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> 'Old wine' is from the previous year.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> 'Aged wine' must last until the coming Sukos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PROPER SIZE OF DWELLINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> If Reuven sold or accepted to build a Chasan's house for Shimon's son or a widow's house for Shimon's daughter, it must be at least four Amos by six Amos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yishmael says, that is proper for a cattle pen!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who wants to build a cattle pen should make it four Amos by six Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A small house is six by eight Amos. A large house is eight by 10. A Traklin must be 10 by 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The height (of each of these) should be half the sum of the length and width - R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, a proof of this is the Heichal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah mention a Chasan's house for Shimon's son or a widow's house for his daughter? Both apply to sons and daughters!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches a matter by the way, that it is improper for a Chasan to live in his mother-in-law's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Sefer ben Sira):</span> The lowliest thing is a Chasan who lives in his father-in-law's house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Worse than this is a guest who invites other guests. Worse than this is one who answers before the other person finished speaking - "Meshiv Davar b'Terem Yishma Iveles Hi Lo u'Chlimah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yishmael says, that is proper for a cattle pen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who taught the proper dimensions for a cattle pen?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Some say that R. Yishmael did. Others say that R. Akiva did.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say that R. Akiva did. He admits that four by six is proper for a cattle pen, and sometimes a person lives in such a dwelling.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Others say that R. Yishmael did, but R. Akiva would say that a cattle pen should be smaller.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Traklin must be 10 by 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Traklin is a hall in which roses are put.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Chatzer (for officers) should be 12 by 12.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The height (of each of these) should be half the sum of the length and width. A proof of this - R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, we learn from the Heichal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who taught 'a proof of this'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel did;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana asked 'what is a proof of this?' R. Shimon ben Gamliel answered 'we learn from the Heichal.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The first Tana taught it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel asked 'Do you learn from the Heichal? Does everyone build like the Heichal?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Others):</span> The height should be like the length of the beams (that span the width of the house).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't they say 'the height should be like width?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The walls are thicker (so the interior is narrower) at the bottom. He teaches that the height should be like the (greater) width at the top.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> There are indentations in which the beams fit. They are slightly longer than the (interior) width of the house.</p>
