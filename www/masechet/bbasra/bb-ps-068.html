<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THINGS THAT SERVE THE BATHHOUSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Reuven said 'I sell to you an olivepress and everything that serves it.' There were stores outside of it (that mainly sold bread and wine, but were also used) for drying sesame (to make oil).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> If he said 'the bathhouse and everything that serves it', all are included. (The same applies here.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> R. Chiya taught that they are not all sold!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> If he said 'the bathhouse and everything that serves it', and delineated the borders and the springs and storehouses are within the borders, they are included. If not, they are not included.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS INCLUDED WITH A CITY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sells a city, this includes the houses, pits, bathhouses, dovecotes, olivepresses and Beis ha'Shelachin (even if it is outside the city);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Metaltelim are not included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he said 'it and everything inside', even animals and slaves are included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if one sells a city, the Santar (this will be explained) is included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Acha brei d'Rav Avya):</span> This implies that slaves are Metaltelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they were like land, they should be included with the city!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they are like Metaltelim, why does the Mishnah say '<i>even</i> slaves are included'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You must say that we distinguish between Metaltelim that move (by themselves) and those that do not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Likewise, we can say that they are like land, and distinguish between land that moves and land that does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If one sells a city, the Santar is included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Santar?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Bavel):</span> It is a slave appointed over the boundaries (whose field belongs to whom - Rashbam; R. Chananel - it is the city watchman).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shimon ben Avtulmus):</span> It is fields around the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first opinion holds that all the more so, the fields are included;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The second opinion holds that the slave (or watchman) is not included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...Olivepresses and Beis ha'Shelachin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Version #1 (We are thinking that 'Shelachin' means fields, like it says "v'Shole'ach Mayim Al Penei Chutzos.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand the first opinion. The first Tana includes fields, and R. Shimon ben Gamliel also includes the slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to the second opinion, R. Shimon ben Gamliel repeats what the first Tana said!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, 'Shelachin' means gardens - "Shelachayich Pardes Rimonim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Version #2 (We are thinking that 'Shelachin' means gardens.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand the second opinion. The first Tana includes gardens, and R. Shimon ben Gamliel includes even fields;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">68b----------------------------------------68b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to the first opinion, the first Tana includes gardens (and excludes fields). Why does R. Shimon ben Gamliel include the slave, and not mention that (all the more so) he includes fields?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, 'Shelachin' means fields, like it says "v'Shole'ach Mayim...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana includes fields, but not the slave. R. Shimon ben Gamliel includes also the slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (against the second opinion - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> The Santar is not sold. The Ankulmus (the scribe who records who paid the tax) is sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the Ankulmus is a person, also the Santar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need not say that they are the same. The Ankulmus is a person, but the Santar is not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT IS INCLUDED WITH A CITY? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa of the Beraisa):</span> He did not sell Sheireha, the surrounding villages, its Muktzeh forests (specific to the city), or the habitats of Chayos, birds and fish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Sheireha?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are Bizli.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Bizli?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> They are pieces of fields (separated from the city by rocky areas).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> These pieces are not sold, but fields themselves are sold!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must switch the Beraisa to say 'R. Yehudah says, the Santar is sold, but the Ankulmus is not sold.''</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel. R. Yehudah holds like Chachamim, and not like R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa of the Beraisa):</span> He did not sell Sheireha, nor the surrounding villages...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says that the villages are sold!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The surrounding villages are not sold;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, they are sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah holds like R. Shimon ben Gamliel regarding the Santar, but not regarding the villages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He did not sell the habitats of Chayos, birds and fish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If there were villages, they are not included;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If part of the city was on the sea and part on the land, the minority is (Rashbam; Rambam - not) sold with the city;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The sale includes habitats of Chayos, birds and fish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the opening of the habitat faces the city, it is included. If not, it is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> He did not sell its Muktzeh forests (specific to the city, even though they face it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here, Muktzeh means that they are set off from it (and face away).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT IS INCLUDED WITH A FIELD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sells a field, this includes rocks needed for the field, reeds needed for a vineyard, attached grain, clusters of reeds that are less than Beis Rova (the amount of land in which a quarter of a Kav of seed is sown, about 104 square Amos), a guardhouse that is not plastered, a young carob tree that has not yet been grafted, and a sycamore tree that has not yet been pruned;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>It does not include rocks and reeds not needed for the field, or detached grain;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he said 'it and everything inside', all these are included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>In any case, he did not sell a thicket of reeds that is more than Beis Rova, a guardhouse that is plastered, a grafted carob tree, or a pruned sycamore tree.</p>
