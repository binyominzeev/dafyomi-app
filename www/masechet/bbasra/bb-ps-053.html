<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CHAZAKAH TO ACQUIRE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav):</span> What is the law regarding a gift?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> What is Rav unsure about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A buyer pays money, yet he does not acquire (if not in front of the seller) unless the seller said 'go make a Chazakah and acquire';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One who receives a gift pays nothing. All the more so he acquires only if the seller said this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav holds that one who gives a gift, he gives (more) generously (than one who sells).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(Rav's question is not resolved.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (We said that fencing or breaching any amount in a wall is a Chazakah.) How much is considered 'any amount'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like Shmuel taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one added to a low fence, and completed it to a height of 10 Tefachim, or widened a hole so that he can leave through it, this is a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of adding to the fence?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If originally people could not go over it (due to the slope or position), and now also they cannot, he accomplished nothing by adding to it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Originally people could go over it (with difficulty), and now they cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He accomplished much. This is not called 'any amount'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Originally people could go over it easily, now they can go over with difficulty.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of breaching the fence?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If originally there was a hole through which people could pass, and he widened it, he accomplished nothing!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Originally people could not pass through, and now they can with difficulty.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He accomplished much. This is not called 'any amount'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Originally people could pass through with difficulty, and now they can pass through easily.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> If he inserted or removed a stone and this helped, it is a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'inserted or removed'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did so to prevent the field from being flooded, or to enable excess water to leave the field, he saved another's property from damage. This is not a Chazakah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he inserted it to keep the water in the field (to irrigate it), or removed it to allow water to enter (to irrigate it. This improves the field; it is a Chazakah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE CHAZAKAH FOR TWO PROPERTIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> If there was a fence between field A and field B (of a convert who died), and Reuven was Machazik in field A to acquire it, he acquires it;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">53b----------------------------------------53b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he was Machazik in field A, intending to acquire both, he acquires only field A;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he was Machazik in field A, intending to acquire B, he does not acquire either field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If he was Machazik in field A with intent to acquire it, the fence and field B, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he intends to acquire also the fence, they are considered like one field (and he acquires everything)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, they are judged like two separate fields, and he acquires only field A?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> If he was Machazik in the fence, intending to acquire both fields, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say 'the fence is like reins on the fields', so he acquires them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is it a matter unto itself, and he does not acquire them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If there were two houses, one inside the other, and one was Machazik in the outer one to acquire it, he acquires it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was Machazik in it with intent to acquire both, he only acquires the outer one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was Machazik in it with intent to acquire the inner one, he does not acquire either.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If he was Machazik in the inner one to acquire it, he acquires it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was Machazik in it with intent to acquire both, he acquires both;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was Machazik in it with intent to acquire the outer one, he does not acquire either.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW TO ACQUIRE HEFKER LAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If Reuven built mansions on Hefker property (a convert owned it, and he died without heirs), and Shimon put doors on them, Shimon acquires them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Without doors, the mansions are mere arrangements of bricks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi bar Yosef):</span> If Levi found a mansion on Hefker property and plastered or engraved a picture on the wall, he acquires it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much area must he plaster or engrave?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It must be a (square) Amah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> It must face the entrance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Amram citing Rav Sheshes):</span> If one spread a sheet on Hefker property and sleeps on it, he acquires the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Sheshes proved this from a Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Reuven makes Chazakah on a slave in any of these ways: the slave ties or unties Reuven's shoe, takes his clothes to the bathhouse, undresses him, bathes him, anoints him, scratches him, dresses him, or lifts him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, Chazakah is not greater than Hagbahah, which acquires everywhere!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the opinions of R. Shimon and Chachamim regarding Hagbahah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana says that if the slave lifts Reuven, Reuven acquires him, but not if Reuven lifts the slave. R. Shimon says that since Chazakah acquires, all the more so Hagbahah (lifting the slave).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>(Just like using a slave is a Chazakah, also using land.)</p>
