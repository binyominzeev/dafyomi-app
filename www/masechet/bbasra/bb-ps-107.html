<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A BROTHER WHO LOST PART OF HIS SHARE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If brothers divided, and a creditor (of their father) took the portion of Ploni (a brother), the division is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Ploni lost. He is not compensated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Ploni gets a quarter of what was taken, in land or (Rashbam; Tosfos - and a quarter) in money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav says that the division is void. We consider it as if each brother inherited his proper share. All must pay the debt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel says that Ploni lost. We consider the brothers to be like buyers (they allow each other to take a share in place of what (Hash-m knows that) he should have inherited) without Acharayus (liability to compensate one whose land is legally taken from him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Asi is unsure whether they are like heirs or like buyers (Tosfos - with Acharayus), and therefore we compromise and he gets a quarter in land or (Tosfos - and a quarter) in money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The Halachah is, in this and the previous argument, the brothers give a portion of their property (they are heirs, like Rav. The division is valid, like Shmuel (106b));</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> The division is invalid (like Rav).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Halachah follows Ameimar.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>VARYING ESTIMATIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If three came to appraise orphans' property, and one said 100 (Zuz), and the others said 200, or vice-versa, we follow the majority;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one said 100, another said 80, and the third said 120, we adopt 100;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok says, we adopt 90 (we will explain the opinions);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Others say, we take a third of the difference between the extreme positions (40) and add it to the lowest opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first opinion adopts 100. This is the average of the extreme positions (Rambam; Rashbam - it is the intermediate opinion);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok says 90, We assume that it is really worth 90;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">107b----------------------------------------107b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The opinions that said 80 and 100 each erred by 10 (only one of them, the third opinion, made a large error).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we say that it is really worth 110, and the ones who said 100 and 120 each erred by 10!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we are unsure which of these is true, we follow the smaller amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Others):</span> We take a third of the difference between the extreme positions and add it to the lowest opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We assume that it is really worth 93 and one third; the opinion that said 80 erred by 13 and one third;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The opinion that said 100 also erred by 13 1/3. He did not say 106 2/3, for he did not want to sound too much higher than the previous opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we say that it is really worth 113 1/3? The ones who said 100 erred by 13 1/3. The opinion that said 120 also erred by 13 1/3. He did not say 126 2/3, for he did not want to sound too much higher than the others!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we are unsure which of these is true, we follow the smaller amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah follows 'Others'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> Their reason is difficult. Can you say that the Halachah follows them?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Judges of Bavel (Shmuel and Karna) - Beraisa):</span> We take a third of the difference between the extreme positions and add it to the lowest opinion.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHICH HALF THE BUYER RECEIVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'I sell to you half of a field', Meshamnim (we divide according to the Shumen (fatness) of the land. Every clause of the Mishnah will be explained later), Shimon takes half a field;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'I sell to you half of a field in the south', Meshamnim, and Shimon takes half in the south.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He (Rashbam - Reuven; Rambam - Shimon) accepts to provide the place for the fence, a ditch six Tefachim wide, and a secondary ditch three Tefachim wide.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> The buyer takes the weaker half of the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> the Mishnah says Meshamnim (each gets half the good land)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (R. Yochanan - Seifa):</span> If he said 'I sell to you half of a field in the south', Meshamnim, and Shimon takes half in the south (whether it is good or not)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> You must say that 'Meshamnim' means that the calculation of half the land is not according to area, rather, according to value;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Also in the Reisha, it means that Shimon gets land worth as much as what Reuven keeps. (I taught only that Reuven can choose to keep the highest quality land.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE DITCHES OUTSIDE THE FENCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He accepts to provide the place for the fence (and a ditch and a secondary ditch...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Both ditches are outside the fence. The secondary ditch is closer to the fence;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The ditches are to prevent a Nemiyah (marten) from jumping over the fence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why isn't a (regular) ditch enough?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it is wide, the marten can jump from the bottom of it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why isn't a secondary ditch enough?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it is thin, the marten can jump from outside of it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much must he leave between the two ditches?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He leaves one Tefach.</p>
