<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS INCLUDED IN A HOUSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sells a house, the following are not included:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Yatzi'a (a type of room), even if it opens into the house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>An inner room (for storing valuables);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The roof, if it has a Ma'akeh (protective railing) 10 Tefachim tall around it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehudah says, if the Ma'akeh has a doorframe, even if it is not 10 Tefachim, it is not included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is a Yatzi'a?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Bavel):</span> It is a lean-to (a low house next to or in back of a house).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> It is a lean-to with many windows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The first opinion agrees that if it has windows, (all the more so) it is not sold (since it is for beauty, it is not primarily for dwelling);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The second opinion says that if it has no windows, it is sold (since it is for dwelling).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Yatzi'a, Tzela and Tei (the names of chamber rooms surrounding the Heichal) are all the same;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "ha'Yatzi'a ha'Tachtonah Chamesh ba'Amah...", "veha'Tzela'os Tzela Al Tzela..." and "veha'Ta Kaneh Echad Orech...".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> The Yatzi'a is excluded only if it is at least four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> A pit or cistern is not included, even if he wrote (that he sells) 'the depth and height';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Will you say that if they are less than four Amos, they are included?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra):</span> Those are different, for they do not serve the same purpose as a house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Yatzi'a is for dwelling. If it is large, it is important by itself, so it is not included with the house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is small, it is not important by itself, and it is included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An inner room (for storing valuables).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Yatzi'a is not included (even though it is for dwelling), there is no need to teach about the inner room!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">61b----------------------------------------61b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that even if the seller delineated boundaries that include the room, it is not included.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SELLING ONE UNIT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If one sold a house in a big Birah (a building through which people pass, many houses are open to the Birah), even if he delineated boundaries of the entire Birah, he merely gave boundaries that people recognize.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If people call the house a house, and the Birah a Birah, this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If people call also the Birah a house, he sold the whole Birah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Most people call the house a house, and the Birah a Birah. Some people also call the Birah a house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that he sold the whole Birah. Rav Nachman teaches that this is not so. Had he sold it, he would have written 'I do not omit anything from this sale.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If one sold a field in a big valley, even if he delineated boundaries of the entire valley, he merely gave boundaries that people recognize.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If people call the field a field, and the valley a valley, this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If people call also the valley a field, he sold it all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Most people call the field a field, and the valley a valley. Some people also call the valley a field;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that he sold it all. Rav Nachman teaches, this is not so. Had he sold it, he would have written 'I do not omit anything from this sale.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Nachman needed to teach both cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he taught only about the house, one might have thought that he did not sell the whole Birah, because it does not serve the same purpose as the house, but he sold the whole valley, because it serves the same purpose as the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had he taught only about the field, one might have thought that he did not sell the whole valley, because the only way to give the borders was to say whose fields surround him, but he sold the whole Birah, because had he sold only the house, he would have specified its borders.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mari, son of Shmuel's daughter):</span> One who sells something must write 'I did not omit anything from this sale.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT IS INCLUDED IN A SALE OF LAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Reuven sold to Shimon 'the land of Bei Chiya.' He owned two lands of that name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> He said that he is selling only one land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he sold 'the lands of Bei Chiya', this connotes at least two;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he sold 'all his land', this includes all his land, except for gardens and vineyards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he sold his 'Zihara (inheritance)', gardens and vineyards are included, but houses and slaves are not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If he sold 'his property', even houses and slaves are included.</p>
