<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven bought two trees in Shimon's property, he did not acquire land (with them);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, he acquired land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If the trees grew, Shimon may not cut the branches (even though the shade harms his field).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Reuven owns whatever grows from the stump, and Shimon owns whatever grows from the roots.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If the trees died, Reuven may not plant new ones in their place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If Reuven bought three trees, he acquires land;</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DECLARATION OF BIKURIM FOR FRUIT FROM THE MARKET</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven bought two trees in Shimon's property, he brings Bikurim, but does not recite the declaration (because he cannot say "the land that You, Hash-m, gave to me.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, he brings and recites.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Meir obligates (to bring and recite) even one who buys fruits in the market.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did Rav Yehudah infer this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from the extra clause in the Mishnah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In our Mishnah, R. Meir teaches that he acquired land. Obviously, he brings and recites!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the other Mishnah, R. Meir says 'he brings and recites' to teach about one who buys fruits in the market.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Asher Tavi me'Artzecha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That excludes fruits of Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know this from "Admasecha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That excludes land of Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "(the land) that You, Hash-m, gave to me"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that Hash-m gave to him money to buy fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven bought one tree in Shimon's property, he brings Bikurim but does not recite, because he did not acquire land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refutes Rav Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BRINGING BIKURIM WITHOUT THE DECLARATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimon ben Elyakim):</span> Why does R. Meir say that one who buys one tree brings Bikurim but does not recite, and why do Chachamim say so about one who buys two trees?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">81b----------------------------------------81b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> The reason was never explained. How should I know?! Your question embarrasses me!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> We can say that they are unsure whether or not one acquires land in these cases!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir explicitly says in the Beraisa 'because he did not acquire land'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means <i>perhaps</i> he did not acquire land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest (he did not acquire, so) the fruit is not really Bikurim, and the Kohen will eat it without separating Terumah and Ma'aseros!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Reuven tithes the fruit (on condition that it is not Bikurim) before giving it to the Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This works for Terumah Gedolah, Ma'aser Sheni and Ma'aser Oni. These are (or may) be given to a (poor) Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, Ma'aser Rishon must be given to a Levi (and we cannot give it to a Levi, lest it is Bikurim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It may be given to a Kohen, according to R. Elazar ben Azaryah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> Terumah Gedolah is given to a Kohen, and Ma'aser Rishon to a Levi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar ben Azaryah says, Ma'aser Rishon may be given to a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is really Bikurim, he must recite the declaration!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is valid Bikurim even if he does not recite.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Zeira taught that if a Minchah is small enough that it could be kneaded, even if it was not kneaded, it is valid. However, if it is too big (i.e. more than 60 Esronim of flour, which is too much to knead (due to the size of the Kli, or because there is with only one Log of oil), it is invalid because it was not possible to knead it! (Here also, since he cannot recite, not reciting invalidates them!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> If Yehudah harvested his fruits and sent them to Yerushalayim through a Shali'ach, and the Shali'ach died on the way, Yehudah brings them but does not recite;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"V'Lakachta... v'Heveisi" - the taking and bringing must be through the same person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Avya):</span> Why doesn't he say the declaration? Even if they are not Bikurim, he merely recites verses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> It is because it appears false.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Mesharshiya brei d'Rav Chiya):</span> If he recites, onlookers will think that in such a case they are definitely Bikurim, and they will give such Bikurim to a Kohen without tithing them.</p>
