<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>YOCHEVED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yikach Es Bas Levi" - is a woman 130 years old called a Bas?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chama bar Chanina):</span> The verse discusses Yocheved, who was conceived on the journey to Mitzrayim, and born between the walls (when they entered Mitzrayim. The above verse discusses Amram remarrying her. Six months later she gave birth to Moshe, who was 80 years old at the time of Yetzi'as Mitzrayim, 210 years after Bnei Yisrael entered Mitzrayim. It follows that she was 130 years old when she remarried.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Asher Yoldah Osah l'Levi b'Mitzrayim" - Yocheved was born in Mitzrayim, but she was not conceived there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The question remains, since she was 130, why is she called "Bas"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah bar Zvida):</span> Signs of youth returned to her. Her skin became smooth, even the wrinkles. Her original beauty returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "va'Yikach"? It should say "he returned"! (Amram remarried her, after separating from her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah bar Zvida):</span> He acted like one who marries. He sat her in a bride's chair. Aharon and Miryam danced in front of her, and angels said "Em ha'Banim Semechah".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE MARRIAGE OF TZELAFCHAD'S DAUGHTERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>When the Torah discusses Tzelafchad's daughters marrying, it lists them in order of their age. Here (when they asked for an inheritance), it lists them according to their Chachmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This supports R. Ami.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> In matters of Torah, we give priority to the greatest Chacham. At a banquet, first priority is to the oldest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> This applies only if he is extremely Chacham or old.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (of the support for R. Ami - Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Va'Tihyenah (they were)" - Tzelafchad's daughters were equal in Chachmah. (This is why they are listed in different orders.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Tzelafchad's daughters were allowed to marry to any tribe - "la'Tov b'Eineihem Tihyenah l'Nashim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse continues "Ach l'Mishpachas Mate Avihem"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is merely good counsel, that they should marry only suitable men.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah - Beraisa):</span> (It says before Aseres ha'Dibros) "Emor Aleihem" - to those that stood on Har Sinai; "l'Doroseichem" refers to generations to come;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it mentions the fathers (who stood on Har Sinai), why must it mention the children (generations to come)? If it mentions the children, why must it mention the fathers?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must say both, because some Mitzvos apply only to the fathers, and others apply only to the children.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It says about the fathers "v'Chol Bas Yoreshes Nachalah" (any daughter who inherits will marry a man of her tribe. This does not apply to the children);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Many Mitzvos apply to the children that did not apply to the fathers (i.e. Mitzvos of Eretz Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Therefore, the verse needed to mention fathers and children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of Rabah's question):</span> This shows that a daughter (of that generation) who inherited was commanded to marry within her tribe!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> All such daughters except for Tzelafchad's were commanded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that "v'Chol Bas Yoreshes Nachalah (will marry a man of her tribe)" applied only to the fathers. How do we learn this from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Zeh ha'Davar" - this matter applies only to this generation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah Zuti):</span> Regarding slaughtering Korbanos outside the Mikdash, it also says "Zeh ha'Davar." Did this only apply to that generation?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> No. There, it says "l'Dorosom".</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">120b----------------------------------------120b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah Zuti):</span> Regarding annulment of vows, it also says "Zeh ha'Davar." Did this only apply to that generation?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> We learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Zeh-Zeh" from slaughtering Korbanos outside the Mikdash, that it applies to all generations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should also learn "Zeh-Zeh" to a daughter who inherits (that it applies to all generations)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, there would be no need to say "Zeh ha'Davar" at all! (We normally assume that any Mitzvah applies to all generations.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Gezeirah Shavah between slaughtering outside the Mikdash and vows was needed for other laws.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE GEZEIRAH SHAVAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For what was the Gezeirah Shavah needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> It says "Zeh ha'Davar" here (regarding vows), and also there (regarding slaughtering outside the Mikdash)l</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There it says "Aharon v'El Banav v'El Kol Bnei Yisrael." This applies also to vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what sense does it apply to vows?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> Three commoners can annul a vow (if the one who vowed regrets it).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Roshei ha'Matos"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches like Rav Chisda taught, that one expert may annul a vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here it says "Roshei ha'Matos." This applies also to slaughtering outside the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what sense does it apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> One who made something Hekdesh can retract this (if he regrets it, just like one can retract a vow).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Beis Shamai, one cannot retract Hekdesh. What do they learn from "Zeh ha'Davar" said regarding slaughtering outside the Mikdash?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If one made something Hekdesh by mistake, it is Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Beis Hillel say, it is not. (We retract Hekdesh by showing that it was a mistake. According to Beis Shamai, in any case it is Hekdesh!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is liable only for <i>slaughtering</i> (Korbanos outside the Mikdash), but not for Melikah (cutting a bird's neck with the fingernail).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Beis Shamai learn from "Zeh ha'Davar" said regarding vows?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Chacham permits vows (retroactively, through regret of the one who vowed), but a husband cannot. A husband annuls vows (from now and onwards, without regret), but a Chacham cannot.</p>
