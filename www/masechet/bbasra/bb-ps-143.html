<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>'ACQUIRE WITH THE DONKEY'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If Levi told Yehudah 'acquire like a donkey', he does not acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If he said 'you and the donkey should acquire', Yehudah receives half.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> Yehudah receives nothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Yehudah receives everything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Sheshes for himself - Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> The most bitter part of a cucumber is the inside;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashbam):</span> Therefore, when taking Terumah, he should take extra from the outside, lest he take from the bitter part to be Terumah on the good part.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> (Even if the inside of a cucumber separated to be Terumah is bitter, it is still considered food. The separation was valid. He need not take (all the) Terumah again.) Therefore, it suffices to add on extra Terumah from the outside. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is like 'acquire with a donkey'! Even though he tried to make the sweet and bitter parts Terumah, and the bitter cannot become Terumah, the sweet becomes Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, mid'Oraisa the bitter part becomes Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila'i):</span> If one separates Terumah from the bad on the good, it takes effect - "v'Lo Sis'u Alav Chet ba'Harimechem Es Chelbo Mimenu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it did not take effect, he would not bear sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mordechai citing Rav Avya - Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in which five women owned a field. Two of them were sisters. Reuven gathered a basket of dates from the field in Shemitah, gave it to them, and said 'all of you are Mekudashos to me with this basket.' One of them received it on behalf of all of them. Chachamim ruled that the sisters are not Mekudashos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The other women are Mekudashos, even though the sisters cannot be. This is like 'acquire with a donkey', and it takes effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> This explains why I saw Rav Huna bar Avya in a dream last night, because his father asked a question!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> We established that the case is, he said 'whoever among you that may have Bi'ah with me is Mekudeshes to me.' (This is excludes the sisters, for surely both have the same status, and both cannot be Mekudashos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If Yakov told his wife 'my property is to you and your sons', she gets half, and her sons get half;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from the following Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "V'Haysah l'Aharon ul'Vanav" - Aharon (the Kohen Gadol) gets half (of the Lechem ha'Panim), and his sons (the other Kohanim) get half.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> There, had the verse not mentioned Aharon, he would have received a share. Surely, he is mentioned to teach that he gets half;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Normally, a wife does not inherit. Yakov mentioned her to teach that she gets a share like her sons!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Cases occurred, and Shmuel and R. Yochanan ruled that she gets half! (Normally, we do not challenge one Amora from another, for they may argue with each other. However, all Chachmei Bavel were Talmidim of Rav or Shmuel (or their Talmidim), and the Halachah follows R. Yochanan against Rav.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Rav Yitzchak bar Yosef taught that once, the king demanded that the rich people and the (less rich) nobles buy a crown for him. Rebbi ruled that the rich pay half, and the nobles pay half!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Question #2):</span> Initially, the king wrote only that the rich must pay. The nobles used to help a small amount. When the king found out, he included the nobles to (increase the demand and) teach that each group pays half.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira - Beraisa):</span> If one said 'it is upon me to bring a Minchah (flour-offering) of 100 Esronim (the volume of 4320 eggs) in two Kelim', he brings 60 in one Keli, and 40 in another Keli;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">143b----------------------------------------143b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he brought 50 in one Keli and 50 in another Keli, he fulfilled his obligation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is only b'Di'eved. According to Rav Yosef, l'Chatchilah he should bring half in each!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, he clearly intends to bring a big Korban. He specified to bring in two Kelim, because he knows that he cannot bring it all in one Keli;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He should bring as much as is possible (60) in one Keli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>The Halachah follows Rav Yosef regarding a field (12b), what is considered engaging in the same matter (to be able to retract - 114a), and giving half to one recipient. (Everywhere else (in Bava Basra, or the entire Gemara), the Halachah follows Rabah against Rav Yosef. Here Rabah does not argue, but one might have thought that the Halachah does not follow Rav Yosef due to the question against him - Rosh Bava Metzia 2:17).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>UNDERSTANDING TO WHOM A MAN LEFT PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If a man (without a wife) sent pieces of silk garments to his house. His sons receive the male garments (what is appropriate for males), and his daughters receive the female garments.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if he does not have a daughter-in-law. If he has, she receives the female garments.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is only if his daughters are married. If not, he gives to them before his daughter-in-law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A Shechiv Mera told witnesses 'my property is l'Vanai (to my sons/children).' He had a son and a daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would a man call one son 'Banai'? (If so, the son gets everything.) If not, his daughter receives half?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We refer to one son in the plural - "u'Vnei Dan Chushim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Perhaps one son is not called 'Banai'. The verse says 'Benei" because Chushim's children would be numerous like Chushim (clusters) of reeds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "U'Vnei Falu Eli'av."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Yosef):</span> "U'Vnei Eisan Azaryah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>A Shechiv Mera told witnesses 'my property is to my sons.' He had a son, and a grandson from a (deceased) son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would a man call a grandson 'my son'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chaviva):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Mar bar Rav Ashi - Beraisa):</span> One who is forbidden by a vow from benefiting from his children is permitted to benefit from his grandchildren.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>POSTHUMOUS IMPROVEMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven died, and left minor and adult sons, and the adults improved the property, the minors share in the improvements;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the adults said 'this is what father left. We want to divide, and we will improve our share', they keep their improvements.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Similarly, if his widow improved the property, the children share the improvements;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she said 'this is what my husband left. I will improve my share', she keeps her improvements.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Chaviva brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> This is only if the brothers did not have expenditures. If they had expenditures, they keep their improvements.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chanina taught that even if the father only left a pit of water (Rashbam; Tosfos - a guard post), they share the revenue;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like improvements that come from expenditures (they must guard)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even minors can guard it (the adults have no more expenditures than the minors).</p>
