<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SALE OF OSIYOS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashbam - (Ameimar):</span> The Halachah follows Rebbi. Osiyos are acquired through Mesirah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - (Ameimar):</span> The Halachah follows Chachamim. Osiyos are not acquired through Mesirah. (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Did you hear that, or do you say it from reasoning?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Ameimar:</span> I heard it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Reasoning also says so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Osiyos are Mili (mere words, without intrinsic value). They cannot be acquired through Mili (Rashbam - another document; Tosfos - Mesirah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah bar Yitzchak taught that there are two laws of documents:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the seller said 'acquire the field for Ploni (through Chalipin) and write the document', he can retract his authorization of a document, but not the gift (they acquired immediately for Ploni);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'acquire the field for him on condition that you write the document', he can retract the document and the gift (until Ploni receives the document).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> There is a third law. The seller wrote the document in the buyer's absence;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">77b----------------------------------------77b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A seller may write the document in the buyer's absence.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>When the buyer makes Chazakah on the field, he acquires the document, wherever it is. (Ran - even if it contains extra rights for the buyer, i.e. Osiyos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Metaltelim can be acquired Agav (along with Kinyan of) land, through money, a document or Chazakah. (Rashbam - the document is acquired just because the seller wants to give it; Tosfos - Agav is a weak Kinyan, like Mili, and it works.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Agav is different (it is a strong Kinyan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Agav is stronger than Chalipin regarding money. Money is not acquired through Chalipin, but it is acquired Agav land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Papa had 12,000 Dinarim in Bei Chuza'i. He gave them to Rav Shmuel bar Acha, Agav the corner of his house, in order that the one guarding them would give them to Rav Shmuel (to return to Rav Papa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He did not sell the slaves, bags or Antiki.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Antiki?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> It is the merchandise in the ship.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS INCLUDED WITH A WAGON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sold a wagon, he did not sell the mules. If he sold the mules, he did not sell the wagon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one sold a yoke, he did not sell the oxen. If he sold the oxen, he did not sell the yoke;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, the price indicates whether or not he sold the oxen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he sold a yoke for 200 Zuz (about a standard year's income), surely this includes the oxen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, the price is not a proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Tachlifa bar Ma'arava - Beraisa):</span> If one sold a wagon, he sells the mules.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Avahu:</span> Our Mishnah says that he did not sell the mules!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Tachlifa:</span> I will no longer recite this Beraisa (it is mistaken).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Avahu:</span> It is not mistaken. The case is, the mules are attached to the wagon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sold a yoke, he did not sell the oxen...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If people call a yoke (only) a yoke, and call oxen (only) oxen, obviously, the oxen are not sold!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, 'yoke' refers to the yoke and the oxen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, surely he sold the oxen as well!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, they (the majority) call a yoke a yoke, and call oxen oxen, and some use 'yoke' to refer to the oxen as well.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah holds that the price indicates what he sold. Chachamim hold that the price is not a proof.</p>
