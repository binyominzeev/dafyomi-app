<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE REWARD OF TZEDAKAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Binyamin ha'Tzadik was appointed over the Kupah of Tzedakah. A woman came in time of famine and asked him to support her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Binyamin swore that there was no money in the Kupah. She said that she and her seven children will die if he does not support them. He supported them from his own money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Later, Binyamin fell sick and was about to die. The angels protested 'saving a single Yisrael is like saving an entire world. Binyamin saved eight souls, should he die young?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Hash-m tore up the decree against him, and gave to him another 22 years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> King Munvaz opened the storehouses of his ancestors in famine years to feed the poor. His family protested 'your fathers saved and increased the wealth their ancestors saved up, and you are squandering it!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Munvaz:</span> They stored up below, in a place where others might take it, and in a way that does not increase. I stored up above, in a place where no one can take it, and in a way that increases - "Fri Ma'aleleihem Yochelu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They stored money, for others, for this world. I stored souls, for myself, for the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO IS CONSIDERED A RESIDENT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he bought a dwelling, he is considered a resident of the city immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Our Mishnah is not like R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> One who buys any land is considered a resident.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> One who buys land fitting for a dwelling is considered a resident.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Tana'im argue about the opinion of R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DIVIDING A CHATZER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We divide a Chatzer only if each partner will get four Amos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We divide a field only if each will get the area fitting to sow nine Kavim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, it suffices if each gets half this amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We divide a garden only if each will get the area to sow half a Kav;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Akiva says, it suffices if each gets half this amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>We divide a salon, small tower, dovecote, garment, bathhouse, olivepress, or Beis ha'Shelachin (a field with a spring to irrigate it) only if each will get a fitting portion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The general rule is, we divide only if each will get a portion that keeps the original name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>All these laws are when only one partner wants to divide. If both want to divide, they may always do so;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Seforim, even if both want to divide, they may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara - Rav Asi):</span> The four Amos of the Mishnah are in addition to the four Amos in front of the doorways of the houses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> We divide a Chatzer only if each partner will get eight Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Our Mishnah says four Amos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This confirms Rav Asi's law. Each must get four Amos in addition to the four Amos in front of his doorway.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - (Mishnah):</span> We divide a Chatzer only if each partner will get four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> We divide a Chatzer only if each partner will get eight Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Asi):</span> Each must get four Amos in addition to the four Amos in front of his doorway. (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> When brothers dividing a Chatzer that they inherited, each gets a share proportional to the number of doorways he has that open into it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Each gets four Amos for each opening. The rest is divided equally.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Chisda - Beraisa):</span> Four Amos are given for each opening in a Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven has one opening and Shimon has two, Reuven gets four Amos, Shimon gets eight Amos and the rest is divided equally.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven had an opening of eight Amos, he gets eight Amos next to it and an additional four Amos in the Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he get another four Amos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Correction (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa means, he gets an area eight Amos long and four Amos wide.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THINGS THAT RECEIVE FOUR AMOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> If Reuven has a hole in the Chatzer for storing pits (for animals to eat), he receives four Amos around it in the Chatzer in every direction.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if he did not have a fixed side from which he would cast pits into it. If he did, he gets only four Amos in that direction.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> An Achsadra (an enclosure with three walls) does not receive four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Four Amos are given in order to unload an animal near the house. One can bring an animal into an Achsadra, so four Amos are not needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> Four Amos are given for a gate of a house or Achsadra.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That refers to an Achsadra of Bei Rav (it is surrounded by four walls with windows).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is a proper room. Obviously, it gets four Amos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it refers to a Roman Achsadra. (The walls are low, and they do not reach to the ceiling.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Four Amos are given for a porch, Achsadra or balcony;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If five houses open into a balcony that has a single entrance to the Chatzer, they only get a total of four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> Does one get four Amos for a chicken coop?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yanai):</span> No. The reason for four Amos is for unloading. Chickens can climb over the wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If only half of a house has a ceiling, are four Amos given for it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> No. This is not only if the ceiling is on the inside, for then one can unload through the exposed part;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, even if the ceiling is on the outside, one can take the animal to the exposed part to unload.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>PARTNERS IN A CHATZER OR MAVUY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna):</span> If a member of a Mavuy (alleyway) wanted to open his house to another Mavuy, can the other people of the Mavuy stop him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> They can stop him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Question (Rav Huna):</span> If people of the city must house soldiers, is the obligation shared according to the number of people, or according to the number of openings in the house?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Question (Rav Huna):</span> If a caravan passes by and leaves manure, do we divide it according to the number of people (each gets an equal share), or according to the number of openings to the Chatzer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> It is according to the number of people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Support (Beraisa):</span> Manure is divided according to the number of openings. Soldiers are quartered according to the number of people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Support (Beraisa):</span> Manure (of the animals of people of the Chatzer) is divided according to the number of openings. Manure from a caravan is divided according to the number of people. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If a member of a Mavuy wanted to close his opening to the Mavuy, the people of the Mavuy can stop him, for this would increase the amount they must walk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If five Chatzeros are open to a Mavuy (that is closed on one end, and the other end is open to the Reshus ha'Rabim), people of each Chatzer are allowed to use the part of the Mavuy from their entrance and outwards, but they may not go towards the closed end. (Clearly, the outer Chatzeros cannot protest if an inner Chatzer wants to close its entrance, for they have no right to go there!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about this matter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If a member of a Mavuy wants to open his house to another Mavuy, the other people of the Mavuy can stop him;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he once had an opening to another Mavuy and closed it, they cannot stop him from re-opening it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, if five Chatzeros are open to a Mavuy, each can use the part near the others.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi did not discuss this case. Why does R. Shimon ben Elazar discuss it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated. It means as follows: (Rebbi also says that) if five Chatzeros are open to a Mavuy, people of each Chatzer are allowed to use the part of the Mavuy from their entrance and outwards, but they may not go inwards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, all may use every part of the Mavuy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If he once had an opening to another Mavuy and closed it, they cannot stop him from re-opening it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is only if he did not remove the doorposts and lintel, but if he did, the others can stop him.</p>
