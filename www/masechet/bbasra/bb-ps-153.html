<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A GIFT WITH ZECHIYAH (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Chachamim of Pumbadisa - Question (Bei Rav):</span> If Reuven wrote a document and a Kinyan was done (Tosfos - and this was written in the document; Rashbam - and the document was given), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> One cannot retract after a Kinyan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rabanan understood that he cannot retract to give to someone else, but he can retract to keep the property himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> He cannot retract even to keep the property himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Reuven wrote a gift document. A Kinyan was done. (He recovered and wanted to retract.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> You did not do like those who want to be able to retract. I cannot help you.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A GIFT 'IN LIFE AND IN DEATH'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a gift document says '<i>b'Chayim</i> (in life) and in death', it is a Matnas Shechiv Mera.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is a gift of a healthy person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav says, because it says 'in death', it acquires after death, i.e. it is a Matnas Shechiv Mera.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He wrote 'in life' only for a good omen (that he should live).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel says, because it says 'in life', it acquires during life. It is a gift of a healthy person;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He wrote 'after death' only to show that the gift is forever.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Neharde'a):</span> The Halachah follows Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If it says '<i>mi'Chayim</i> (from when he is alive)', it is a gift of a healthy person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> The Halachah does not follow Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> This is obvious. Chachamim of Neharde'a said that the Halachah follows Rav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Rav admits when he says 'mi'Chayim.' Ameimar teaches that he does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Reuven wrote a gift 'in life and in death.' Rav Nachman told him to go to R. Yirmeyah bar Aba in Shum Tamya. (Surely, R. Yirmeyah would rule like the Halachah, i.e. like Rav.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Here (Neharde'a) is Shmuel's region. I cannot rule here like Rav here!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Leah wrote a gift 'mi'Chayim.' Rava ruled like he taught (that she cannot retract). She was protesting the ruling.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava told Rav Papa bar Rav Chanan (his scribe) 'write for her that the decision was that she may retract (so she will go away). Write at the bottom 'he may hire others at their expense, or deceive them' (a Mishnah discussing workers that retracted. Any Chacham who sees this will understand that this was written to deceive her. Really, she cannot retract).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Leah:</span> You want to trick me. Your boat should sink!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They soaked Rava's garments in water (in order that this should be the fulfillment of the curse). Still, his boat sank.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE GIFT OF A QUESTIONABLE SHECHIV MERA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven wrote a gift document, and it did not say that he was sick, and he says that he was sick, and the recipients say that he was healthy, Reuven must bring proof;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, to take money from another, one (in this case, the recipients) must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> A gift document said 'he said to give...' It did not say 'he died from the sickness.' (The giver is now dead.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">153b----------------------------------------153b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> We assume that he died from that sickness, and did not recover in between.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Most people on sinking ships die, yet we are stringent, perhaps they are still alive;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Most sick people recover, and all the more so we should be stringent, perhaps he recovered (and the gift was nullified)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Rabah holds like R. Noson.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yakov):</span> (If a gift document did not say if the giver was healthy or sick,) the giver can take the property from the recipients (even if they already took it) without a proof (that he was sick at the time). They can take it only if they bring proof;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Noson says, if the giver is healthy now, he must bring proof that he was sick. If he is sick now, they must bring proof that he was healthy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> These Tana'im would argue similarly about Tum'ah (whether we follow the original status, i.e. when the doubtful Tum'ah occurred, or the current status, i.e. when the question was asked).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In summer, a valley (enclosed by a fence) is a Reshus ha'Yachid concerning carrying on Shabbos, it is a Reshus ha'Rabim regarding Tum'ah (in doubtful cases of Tum'ah, we assume that it is Tahor);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In winter (when very few people walk through), it is a Reshus ha'Yachid also for Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is only if winter did not pass from the time of the doubtful Tum'ah (Tosfos; Rashbam - from the time the valley was fenced). If it did, we considered (and must continue to consider) it a Reshus ha'Yachid.</p>
