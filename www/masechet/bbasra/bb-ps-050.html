<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A MARRIED WOMAN WHO SOLD HER PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rabah bar Rav Huna come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He excludes other property (to which she has no rights).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> All the more so, she can say 'I merely wanted to please my husband', because he would be very upset if she refused! (He would assume she anticipates being divorced or widowed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he excludes Milug property (she gets it back like it is with her Kesuvah, even if it declined or increased in value. Regarding such property, if he can prove that she sold it to him, he keeps it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ameimar taught that if a man and his wife sold her Milug property, the sale is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, that is when he <i>or</i> she sold it,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he sold it and died, she takes the property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she sold it and died, he takes the property due to an enactment mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> In Usha they enacted that if a woman sold her Milug property and died, her husband takes it from the buyer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If they both sold it, or if she sold it to her husband, the sale is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Ameimar holds like R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven sold his (Kena'ani) slave to Shimon, and stipulated 'the slave will still work for me for 30 days', the law of Yom O Yomayim applies to Reuven (if he strikes the slave and he dies from the blow after 24 hours, Reuven is not killed, since the slave is working for him). It does not apply to Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Meir holds that Kinyan Peros (regarding a slave, his labor) is like Kinyan ha'Guf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, (Yom O Yomayim) applies to Shimon (for the slave is his property), but not to Reuven;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yehudah holds that Kinyan Peros is not like Kinyan ha'Guf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi says, it applies to Reuven (for the slave is working for him) and to Shimon (for the slave is his property);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">50b----------------------------------------50b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yosi is in doubt whether or not Kinyan Peros (labor) is like Kinyan ha'Guf (therefore, we do not kill either master);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Elazar says, it does not apply to Reuven (for the slave is not his property) nor to Shimon (for the slave is not working for him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is R. Elazar's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Lo Yukam Ki Kaspo Hu" - he must be entirely the property of the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>(Likewise, since Milug property is not entirely the property of the husband or wife, neither can sell it.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHAZAKAH IN A PROPERTY OF A MARRIED WOMAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man does not get a Chazakah in his wife's property...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav taught that a married woman must protest (against someone on her property)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Against whom must she protest?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> She must protest against another man.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav taught that one cannot make a Chazakah in the property of a married woman!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, she must protest against her husband. (If she does not, he gets a Chazakah in her property!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (and Answer #2 to Question b:1 - Rava):</span> Really, she must protest against her husband. The case is, he was digging pits in her property. (Since his right to eat the Peros does not allow him to dig pits, this proves that he bought it from her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah taught that there is no Chazakah regarding damages!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He meant that the usual three years of Chazakah are not needed for one who damages property (rather, he gets a Chazakah immediately. If someone else owned it, he would protest immediately!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He meant that one is never Muchzak to do something that is very damaging to his neighbor:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mari):</span> One is never Muchzak to make smoke enter his neighbor's property;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid):</span> One is never Muchzak to use an area as a bathroom if the stench will reach his neighbor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> Really, Rav meant that a married woman must protest against another man;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, the man used her field for some time before her husband died, and for three years after her husband died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Migo he would be believed to say that he bought it from her, he is believed to say 'you sold it to your husband, and I bought it from him.'</p>
