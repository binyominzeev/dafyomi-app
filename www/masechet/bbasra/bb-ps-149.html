<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA BASRA 149 - A week of learning has been dedicated towards meriting a Refu'ah Sheleimah for Eliezer Lipa ben Yetta, by Mr. and Mrs. Kornfeld of Yerushalayim. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PHRASES THAT EXPRESS TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> 'He will take, he will merit, he will make Chazakah, he will acquire' are all expressions of a gift (but an expression of inheritance does not take effect, according to Chachamim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even if he said 'he will inherit', if the recipient could inherit the giver, it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like R. Yochanan ben Brokah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he said 'he will benefit from them', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he mean that they are a total gift?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does he mean that he may benefit from them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> If he said 'he will be seen in them', 'he will stand in them', or 'he will be supported by them', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>These questions are unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one sold all his property, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> If he recovered, he cannot retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> If he recovered, he can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>These answers do not argue. If he still has the money he received for it, he can retract. If he used the money to pay debts, he cannot retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Shechiv Mera admitted (that property that was Muchzak to be his really belongs to someone else), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the following episode.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Isar (a convert) had deposited 12,000 Zuz with Rava. Isar was about to die, and he wanted to give to them to his son Rav Mari. Isar had converted between the conception and birth of Mari. (According to Halachah, Isar had no sons or heirs.) Mari was away learning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Isar has no way to give the money to Mari!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Mari does not inherit Isar;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He cannot give a Matnas Shechiv Mera. It is like inheritance, so only one who has heirs can give a Matnas Shechiv Mera;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>He cannot give through Chalipin, for coins cannot be acquired through Chalipin;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>He cannot give Agav (along with) land, for he does not own land;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>If he wants to give through Ma'amad Sheloshtan (144a; Reuven tells Shimon in front of Levi 'you have money of mine. Give it to Levi', Levi acquires it), I will not go;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ika brei d'Rav Ami):</span> He can admit that the money belongs to Rav Mari. Rav Mari will acquire through Odisa (Kinyan through (even a false) admission)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Word spread that Isar admitted that the money belongs to Rav Mari; Rava was upset that someone told him, causing a loss to Rava! (If not for the Odisa, the money would have become Hefker when Isar died, and Rava could have kept it.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW MUCH MUST A <i>SHECHIV MERA</i> LEAVE OVER?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he left over any amount of land, he cannot retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What it considered 'any amount'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> He must leave enough land to support himself from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> He must leave enough Metaltelim to support himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> These are great teachings!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he left over any amount of land, he cannot retract. This shows that he made provisions to support himself (in case he will live);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The same reasoning applies when he leaves over Metaltelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objections (Rav Yosef):</span> The Mishnah discusses leaving over only land, but not Metaltelim! The Mishnah discusses leaving over any amount, even if it is not enough to support himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (part 1 - Abaye):</span> Sometimes a Mishnah says 'land', but it also applies to Metaltelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven wrote all his property to his slave, the slave goes free (and gets everything);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven kept any amount of land, the slave is not free. (This suggests that Reuven kept also part of the slave. Partial freedom does not take effect);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon says, in either case he is free, unless Reuven wrote 'all my property is to my slave, except for one part in 10,000 (or any fixed fraction, for then he keeps part of the slave)'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi bar Yosef):</span> Keeping Metaltelim is like keeping land regarding a slave (he does not go free), but not regarding a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(If one wrote his property to his sons and gave to his wife any amount of land, she forfeits her lien on the property to collect her Kesuvah. This does not apply if he gave to her Metaltelim.)</p>
