<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHERE WE SIGN TIED GITIN (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> R. Yirmeyah bar Aba says that they sign opposite the text, corresponding to where the text is (and the document need not say 'Sharir v'Kayam');</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should be concerned lest he add to the text, and add invalid witnesses (opposite the added text. He can validate the document through any three witnesses, e.g. the first ones);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He can say 'I wanted to have extra witnesses!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> The witnesses do not sign widthwise (i.e. the way the text was written), rather, lengthwise (each starts his name opposite the bottom line of text, and finishes opposite the top line).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the end of the document is unfavorable for the bearer, he might be able to cut it off!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a witness signed 'Reuven ben Yakov, Ed (witnesses)', perhaps one can cut off the bottom, and 'Ben Yakov, Ed' will remain for a signature!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> 'Ben Ploni Ed' is a valid signature.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Each witness writes his name <i>and</i> the word 'Ben' on the bottom line (i.e. opposite the bottom line of the text. If one will cut off the bottom line, he will also cut off 'Ben'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He can cut off 'Reuven ben', and 'Yakov Ed' will remain!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> 'Ish Ploni Ed' is a valid signature.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, the witnesses do not write 'Ed' after their names.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They do write 'Ed' after their names. The case is, we know that no Yakov in this kingdom signs like this.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">161b----------------------------------------161b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they will think that Reuven normally uses his father's name for his signature! (Letter of the law, one need not sign his own name - Gitin 36a.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One would not sign his father's name in place of his own name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they will think that he signs 'Yakov' in place of his own name!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Many Amora'im used symbols in place of signing their names. Rav would draw a fish, R. Chanina drew a branch, Rav Chisda made a 'Samech', R. Hoshaya made an 'Ayin', and Rabah bar Rav Huna made a mast.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is not so brazen to make his father's name a symbol in place of his own name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mar Zutra):</span> R. Yirmeyah holds that all the signatures must finish in the same line. (Rashbam - they all extend from the top to the bottom line, or vice-versa; Tosfos - every word of the signature starts in the bottom line).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE LAST LINE OF A DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> (We said that an erasure does not invalidate a Get unless it is in a place fitting and large enough for it to say 'Sharir v'Kayam.' In any case,) an erasure must be mentioned in the Get (before 'Sharir v'Kayam', to ensure that nothing was erased after the Get was signed)'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The last line of the Get must recap the Get (i.e. it cannot teach any new obligations or conditions).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Amram):</span> We do not learn from the last line of a document.</p>
