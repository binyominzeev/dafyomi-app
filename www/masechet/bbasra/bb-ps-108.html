<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO INHERITS AND BEQUEATHS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Some (pairs of) relatives inherit from and bequeath to each other. In some cases, one relative inherits the other, but does not bequeath to the other. In some cases, one bequeaths to the other, but does not inherit from the other. Some relatives do not inherit or bequeath to each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The following inherit and bequeath to each other:</span> a father and his sons (he inherits them, and bequeaths to them); sons and their father; paternal brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The following inherit but do not bequeath:</span> a man from his mother, a man from his wife, and sons of sisters (a man inherits his mother's sister).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The following bequeath but do not inherit:</span> a woman to her sons, a woman to her husband, and a man to his sister's children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Maternal brothers (from different fathers) neither inherit nor bequeath to each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why did the Mishnah first list a father (inheriting) his sons, rather than sons inheriting a father?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Firstly, we should not begin which a tragic case (a son died childless in his father's lifetime)!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">108b----------------------------------------108b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Secondly, we should begin like the Torah begins - "if a man will die u'Ven Ein Lo" (this implies that had he left a son, the son would inherit him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must expound to learn that a father inherits his sons. Therefore, this law is dear to the Tana, so he taught it first.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A FATHER INHERITS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is the law learned?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> "She'ero (his close relative)" refers to the father. It teaches that if Reuven dies, his father has precedence to inherit him before Reuven's brothers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Reuven's father has precedence over Reuven's son!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ha'Karov" teaches that the closest relative has precedence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Reuven's son is a closer relative than Reuven's father, but Reuven's brother is not closer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A son stands in place of his father in two ways: Yi'ud (he can marry his father's Jewish slave in place of his father), and for Pidyon Sedei Achuzah (if his father was Makdish his ancestral inheritance, if his son redeems it, it reverts to the father in Yovel. If anyone else redeemed it, Kohanim receive it in Yovel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps a brother is closer, for he is in place of his brother regarding Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yibum applies only when a man leaves no sons. This shows that a son is in place of his father more than a brother is in place of a brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If not for this answer, the brother would be considered closer!</p>
