<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EXAMPLES OF CHAZAKAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah Bira'ah):</span> If one seeds a turnip in the cracks of Hefker property, this is not a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When he seeded it, he did not improve the land. The improvement (the turnip sprouts) happens by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one prunes a date tree so it will grow better, he acquires it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he pruned it to feed to his animals (even though he intended to acquire it), this is not a Chazakah (because he did not intend to improve the tree).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know whether or not he intended to improve the tree?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he took branches from all sides of the tree, he intended to improve the tree. If he took branches from only one side, he did so for his animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one takes pieces of wood and grass from a field so it will be easier to plow, he acquires it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he took them for burning, he does not acquire (this is like eating Peros, which is not a Chazakah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know what his intention was?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he took big and small pieces, he intended to improve the field. If he took only big pieces, he did so for fuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one leveled a field so it will be easier to plow, he acquires it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did so to prepare the area to thresh grain, he does not acquire (a granary is detrimental to the field in the long term).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know what his intention was?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he put the dirt of the mounds into the ditches, he intended to improve the field. If he merely flattened them a bit (to reduce the slope), he did so for threshing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one made an opening so that water (from the river) will enter a field to irrigate it, he acquires it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did so for fishing, he does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know what his intention was?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he made one opening for water to enter from the river and another for water to leave, he did so for fishing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he made only an opening for water to enter, it was for irrigation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>A woman pruned a date tree for 13 years, from one side. A man came and dug under it a bit. Levi ruled that he gets it. The woman was protesting.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> You did not make Chazakah like people normally do!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one draws a picture (of an animal or bird) on the wall of a Hefker house, he acquires it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This was inferred from a case that occurred. A convert who owned a garden near Rav's Beis Medrash died. Rav acquired it by drawing a picture.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MUST ONE DIG IN THE ENTIRE FIELD?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> If one digs any amount in a field surrounded by fences, he acquires the entire field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He acquires only where he digs.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">54b----------------------------------------54b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to Rav Huna,) if the field is not surrounded by fences, how much does he acquire through one insertion of the shovel? (Tosfos; Rashbam - how much must he dig to acquire the entire field?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> He acquires the standard length of a furrow (Tosfos; Rashbam - he must plow two furrows along the length of the entire field).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BUYING FROM A NOCHRI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> A Nochri's property (after he sold it to a Yisrael) is like Hefker: whoever makes a Chazakah in it acquires it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once a Nochri receives the money, he relinquishes his ownership of the property. The Yisrael does not acquire until he gets a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Shmuel could not have said that, for Shmuel holds that the law of the kingdom is binding, and the king says that one needs a document to acquire (Chazakah is not enough)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> A case occurred in which Reuven bought land from a Nochri, and Shimon dug a little in it. Rav Yehudah ruled that Shimon keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> There is different, for the Nochri himself did not pay the land tax. The king's law is that whoever pays the tax gets the Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Huna bought land from a Nochri, and Levi dug a little in it. Rav Nachman ruled that Levi keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> You rule like Shmuel, that a Nochri's property is like Hefker, and whoever makes a Chazakah in it acquires it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You should also rule like Shmuel's other law, that he acquires only where he dug!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Regarding that law, I rule like you yourself said in Rav's name: if one digs any amount, he acquires the entire field.</p>
