<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE DIVISION OF THE LAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was Eretz Yisrael divided among the tribes, or among the people?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Bein Rav li'M'at (each tribe will receive an equal portion)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> In the future, Eretz Yisrael will be divided among 13 tribes. Originally, it was divided only among 12;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was divided only according to the value of the land - "Bein Rav li'M'at".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yehudah says, a field in Yehudah (big enough to sow) one Se'ah is equal to a five Sa'os field in Galil.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It was divided only by lottery - "Ach b'Goral".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It was divided only with the Urim v'Tumim (stones on the Kohen Gadol's garment on which letters would light up to answer questions) - "Al Pi ha'Goral"</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Elazar was wearing the Urim v'Tumim. Yehoshua and all of Yisrael were in front of him. One box contained the names of the tribes. Another box contained the names of the portions of Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>With Divine inspiration, Elazar predicted which tribe would be selected, and which portion, e.g. Zevulun, and the portion by Ako. He then pulled these from the respective boxes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The division in this world is unlike the division in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In this world, one who gets a grain field does not get an orchard, and vice-versa. In the world to come, everyone will receive a share in the mountain, plain and valley - "Sha'ar Reuven Echad Sha'ar Yehudah Echad...";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>(In the world to come), Hash-m will make the division himself - "v'Eleh Machlekosam Ne'um Hash-m".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Summation of answer):</span> The Beraisa says that it was divided only among 12. This shows that it was divided to the tribes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that Eretz Yisrael will be divided among 13 tribes. To whom is the extra portion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is for the Nasi - "veha'Oved ha'Ir Ya'avduhu (they will give to him an inheritance) mi'Kol Shivtei Yisrael".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps they just temporarily allow him to use their land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> "Veha'Nosar la'Nasi ..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It was divided only according to value - "Bein Rav li'M'at".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding what was this taught?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to the different qualities of land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We do not discuss fools (who accept money in place of the proper amount of land)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, a field closer (to the Mikdash) is worth more. (Chasam Sofer 1:29 DH v'Ye'ayen - at first, the Mishkan was in Shilo, and whoever was closer to Shilo compensated those further away. When Yerushalayim was chosen over 400 years later, those closer to Yerushalayim compensated those further away.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Tana'im argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Those who received closer portions gave monetary compensation to those that received distant portions.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, compensation was given in land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah says, a field in Yehudah (big enough to sow) one Se'ah is equal to a field of five Se'im in Galil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It was divided only by lottery - "Ach b'Goral."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ach b'Goral" excludes Kalev and Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what sense are they excluded?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They did not receive anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They received even portions of others (the Meraglim), and all the more so they received what was due to them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they did not receive according to the lottery. Rather, Hash-m declared what they received.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Al Pi Hash-m Nosnu Lo Es ha'Ir... Timnas Serach."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">122b----------------------------------------122b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Elsewhere, it is called "Cheres"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> At first, its fruits were as hard as earthenware (Cheres). After Yehoshua received it, they were so juicy that they could spoil (Masri'ach).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> At first, its fruits were juicy, and would spoil. After Yehoshua received it, they would never spoil, like earthenware.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Va'Yitenu l'Chalev Es Chevron..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chevron is a city of refuge (it belongs to the Leviyim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Kalev received the surrounding towns - "v'Es Sede ha'Ir v'Es Chatzereha Nosenu l'Kalev."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SONS INHERIT MORE THAN DAUGHTERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A son and a daughter inherit the same way, except that a (firstborn) son receives a double portion in his father's property, but not in his mother's property;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Daughters are fed from the father's property, but not from the mother's property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does it mean 'a son and a daughter inherit the same way?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They split the inheritance.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> A son inherits before a daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> A son and a daughter both inherit property that is Ra'uy (destined) to come, just like they inherit property owned by the parent at the time of death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> We already learned that in a Mishnah! Tzelafchad's daughters received three portions: Tzelafchad's own portion, his share of his father's portion (even though it was only Ra'uy)...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Why does our Mishnah say 'except'? (This is unrelated to what came before!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Both a son and a daughter (i.e. when there are no sons and she inherits) inherit the extra share of the firstborn (if their father was a firstborn).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> We already learned that in a Mishnah! Tzelafchad's daughters received... and Tzelafchad's extra share of his father's portion, for he was a firstborn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Why does it say 'except'? (Also daughters do not receive a double portion in the mother's property, just like sons!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> A son among sons is like a daughter among daughters. If the parent said that he/she should inherit everything, this takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> This is like R. Yochanan ben Brokah. A coming Mishnah teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yochanan ben Brokah):</span> If Reuven said 'Shimon should inherit me', if Shimon could inherit him, it takes effect; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps our Mishnah teaches it Stam (anonymously), to teach that this is the Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If a Stam Mishnah is followed by a Mishnah in which Tana'im argue, the Halachah does not (necessarily) follow the Stam Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Why does it say 'except'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> A daughter (when there are no sons) inherits like a son would in the property of the mother and father, except that a (firstborn) son receives a double portion in the property of the father, and not in the property of the mother.</p>
