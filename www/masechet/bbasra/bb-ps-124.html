<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IN WHAT DOES A FIRSTBORN RECEIVE A DOUBLE SHARE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Beraisa is like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A firstborn does not get a double share in Shevach after the father's death;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says, he gets a double share in Shevach, but not in Shevach due to the orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If they inherited a loan document, the firstborn collects an extra share. If a creditor showed a document showing that their father owed to him money, the firstborn pays a double share;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The firstborn may say 'I will not collect more than one share, nor pay more than one share.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>Lases</i> Lo Pi Shnayim" - the Torah calls it a gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a gift takes effect only after it comes to the receiver, also the extra share of the firstborn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rebbi expounds "Pi Shnayim" to equate the regular share and the additional share.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like he inherits a regular share even in property that the father did not own in his lifetime, also the additional share.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from "Pi Shnayim"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that he receives both portions in adjacent plots.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rebbi learn from the fact that the Torah calls the extra share a gift?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that he has the option not to receive and not pay extra (to a creditor of the father).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If a date tree got stronger, or land became fertilized, all agree that the firstborn gets a double share;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about unripe Peros that ripened.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi considers them like Shevach that comes by itself. Chachamim consider them like something new.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS THE HALACHAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rabah bar Chana):</span> If one ruled like Rebbi, the ruling stands. If he ruled like Chachamim, the ruling stands.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">124b----------------------------------------124b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is unsure if the Halachah follows Rebbi against one colleague, but not against many colleagues;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps the Halachah follows Rebbi even against many colleagues.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Rav Nachman citing Rav):</span> One may not rule like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that the Halachah follows Rebbi against one colleague, but not against many.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #3 (Rav Nachman himself):</span> One may rule like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that (Tosfos - here) the Halachah follows Rebbi even against many colleagues.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #4 (Rava):</span> One may not rule like Rebbi. If one did, the ruling stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that the general rule that (we follow Rebbi against one colleague but) we do not follow Rebbi against many colleagues is not absolute. The rule says only that we <i>lean</i> to rule like this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman - Beraisa):</span> "B'Chol Asher Yimatzei Lo" excludes increased value due to the orphans after the father died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the property went up in value by itself, the firstborn gets an extra share of this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This Beraisa is like Rebbi (in the Beraisa on 124a).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama - Beraisa):</span> "B'Chol Asher Yimatzei Lo" excludes if the property went up in value by itself, the firstborn gets no extra share;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All the more so, he has no extra share in increased value due to the orphans after the father died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This Beraisa is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DEBTS DUE TO THE FATHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A firstborn does not receive a double portion in a loan due to the father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to which Tana is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They say that he does not get an extra share even in increased value of property that the father's owned. They need not teach that he has no extra share in a loan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa):</span> If they inherit a loan document, the firstborn receives a double portion in the principal and the interest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Rebbi admits that he has no extra share in a loan, this Beraisa is not like Rebbi, and not like Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, Rav Yehudah's law is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was not obvious that he has no extra share. One might have thought that a document is considered as if it was collected. Chachamim teach that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> (If they inherit a loan,) the firstborn receives a double portion in the principal, but not in the interest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like which Tana is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They say that he has no extra share even in increased value of property in the father's possession. Surely he has no extra share in a loan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is according to Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rebbi holds that he receives an extra share in the interest!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> (If they inherit a loan,) the firstborn receives a double portion in the principal and the interest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, it is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A loan is considered as if it were already collected.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> (If they inherit a loan,) the firstborn receives a double portion in the principal, but not in the interest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> This is the opinion of Chachamim of Neharde'a (which includes Ameimar and Rabah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If they collected land for a debt due to their father, the firstborn gets a double share in this. If they collected money, he gets no extra share.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If they collected land, the firstborn gets no extra share. If they collected money, he gets an extra share.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Both of these opinions are difficult!</p>
