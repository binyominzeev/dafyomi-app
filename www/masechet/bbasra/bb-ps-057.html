<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>COMBINING THE TESTIMONY OF BROTHERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If David testified about all three years, and three brothers testified, each about one of the three years, these are three testimonies. Regarding Hazamah, it is one testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Reuven and Moshe had signed a document, and Reuven died. (To validate the document, Moshe verified his signature, and) Moshe's brother (Aharon) and a stranger came to testify about Reuven's signature.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> This is like the Mishnah. One witness can combine with brothers regarding years of Chazakah. Also here, the stranger joins Moshe and Aharon regarding the signatures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> No. In the Mishnah, only half the testimony is from the brothers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, Moshe and Aharon supply three quarters of the testimony (so it is not allowed).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT MAKES A CHAZAKAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Not all uses of a Chatzer make a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The following do not make a Chazakah:</span> leaving one's animal there, setting up an oven or millstone, or raising chickens;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one sets up a 10 Tefachim wall to enclose his animal, or for his oven or millstone, or brings chickens in a house, or made a ditch three Tefachim deep or a pile three Tefachim tall for his waste, this is a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the Reisha (things that do not make Chazakah) and the Seifa (surely, an owner would object to all the uses listed. If no one protested, this proves ownership)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> Any Chazakah that acquires Hefker property (those in the Seifa) is a Chazakah to prove ownership (in what used to belong to someone else). A Chazakah that does not acquire Hefker (those of the Reisha) is not a Chazakah to prove ownership.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> This is not always true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Plowing acquires Hefker property, but it is not a Chazakah to prove ownership. Eating Peros does not acquire Hefker property, but it is a Chazakah to prove ownership.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> The Mishnah discusses a jointly owned Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">57b----------------------------------------57b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Partners do not object to these temporary uses. They do object to a wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Partners do object to these temporary uses!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If partners (in a Chatzer) vowed not to benefit from each other, they may not enter the Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman):</span> The Mishnah discusses the area in back of houses. There, people do not object to these temporary uses, but they object to a wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Indeed, our Mishnah discusses a jointly owned Chatzer. Some people object to temporary uses, others do not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Since we do not know whether or not these partners object,) regarding money we are 'lenient' (we say that they do not object, so the Machazik has no proof of ownership to take the property). Regarding Isurim (vows) we are stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> (Our Mishnah discusses a jointly owned Chatzer,) people do not object to temporary uses (therefore, it is not a Chazakah); the Mishnah about vows is R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Even Vitur (things that people freely give or allow) is forbidden to someone who is forbidden to benefit due to a vow..</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Partners can object against each other regarding any use of the Chatzer, except for laundry. This is an enactment lest women need to launder in the river (which leads to immodesty).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WAYS OF CHACHAMIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> "V'Otzem Einav me'R'os b'Ra" refers to one who does not look at women washing laundry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he could have chosen a path on which women do not wash laundry, he is evil!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If there was no other path, this is Ones (Rashbam - why is he expected to close his eyes? Ramah - he must look so he will not fall)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, there was no other path. Still, he should force himself (Rashbam - to look the other way; Ramah - to avoid looking, even though he might fall.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> What kind of tunic befits a Chacham?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Bana'ah):</span> It does not allow his feet to be seen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> What kind of outer cloak befits a Chacham?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Bana'ah):</span> It does not allow a Tefach of his tunic to be seen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> What kind of table befits a Chacham?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Bana'ah):</span> Two thirds is covered with a cloth, and one third is uncovered, for plates and vegetables. The ring (from which the table is hung) should be on the outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The ring is on the inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If children eat with him, the ring should be on the outside (so they will not play with it and shake the table);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If children do not eat with him, the ring should be on the inside (lest the waiter trip on it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> In both cases, children do not eat with him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a waiter serves them, the ring should be on the inside (lest the waiter trip on it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If no waiter serves them, it should be on the outside (lest the people eating get hurt from it);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> In both cases, a waiter serves them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>During the day, the waiter can see, and he will not trip on it, so the ring should be on the outside (lest the people eating get hurt);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>At night, we are more concerned lest the waiter trip on it, so the ring should be on the outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">The table of an ignoramus is like a bonfire (surrounded by pots):</span> the cloth and bread are inside, and the plates are outside.</p>
