<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE HALACHAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah bar Aba citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah bar Aba:</span> Many times I said in front of Rav that the Halachah follows R. Akiva, and he did not respond!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> How do you learn the argument?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah:</span> R. Akiva says that one sells stingily, and Chachamim say that one sells generously.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> He did not respond, for the Halachah is that one sells stingily. According to your version of the argument, the Halachah follows R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Ravina):</span> Rav and Shmuel hold like they taught elsewhere. (It seems that Ravina and Rav Nachman hold that Rav and Shmuel argue, i.e. also Shmuel had our text of the Mishnah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> Brothers who divide an inheritance (are like buyers and sellers; they) do not have rights to walk over each other's property (even if one can only get to his property through his brother's, for they sell generously), and they have no rights to set up ladders or have windows (to prevent the other from building near it) or run an irrigation ditch through the other's property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> They have all these rights against each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>They must argue in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Had they argued only about brothers, one might have thought that Rav's reason is that the heirs are entitled to live like their father did - "Tachas Avosecha Yihyu Vanecha", but normally, Rav holds that one sells generously;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Had they argued only about a regular sale, one might have thought that Shmuel would agree about brothers ("Tachas Avosecha...")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman, to Rav Huna):</span> Is the Halachah like us (Shmuel and his Talmidim), or like you (and Rav)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> It is like you, for you are close to the Reish Galusa and see how the judges rule. (According to Rav Huna, Rav and Shmuel argue only about brothers. Alternatively, Rav Huna answered 'if you are right (and R. Yirmeyah is wrong), and Shmuel rules that people sell generously, the Halachah follows him in both cases.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Reuven owned an inner house and an outer house. If he sold or gave (at the same time) the inner house to Shimon and the outer house to Levi, neither has rights to walk through the other, and all the more so if he gave the outer house and sold the inner house (since he gave the gift to Levi, this shows that he favors him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Also if he gave the inner house and sold the outer house, neither has rights to walk through the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is wrong.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This applies to a sale, but one who gives (a gift) gives everything.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One gives generously.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also regarding the houses, Reuven gives generously to Shimon, and included a path.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS INCLUDED IN A HOUSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sells a house, he sells the door, but not the key. He sells a mortar attached to the floor, but not an unattached mortar. He sells the fixed frame around a millstone, but not the funnel, nor Tanur or Kirayim (types of ovens);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'the house and everything inside', they are all included.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">65b----------------------------------------65b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is not like R. Meir, for he says that one who sells a vineyard includes everything needed for the vineyard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Our Mishnah is even like R. Meir. R. Meir includes only things that are stationary. Our Mishnah excludes only things that are moved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The key is not sold, and presumably, it is like the door (with which it is taught), i.e. it is fixed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Indeed, the Mishnah is not like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sells a house, he sells the door, the latch (fixed in the wall), and the lock (fixed in the door), but not the key;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>He sells a mortar that is carved into the wall, but not one that was affixed. He sells the frame around a millstone, but not the funnel, Tanur, Kirayim or millstone;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Eliezer says, anything attached to the ground is like the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If he said 'the house and everything inside', all these are included;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In any case, he did not include a pit, cistern or Yatzi'a.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED LIKE LAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a pipe was hollowed out and then attached (it is considered a Keli), it disqualifies a Mikveh. (If three Lugim of water from it fall into an incomplete Mikveh, the Mikveh is disqualified, even when it will have enough water);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was attached and then hollowed out, it does not disqualify a Mikveh (for it is not considered a Keli).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa is not like R. Eliezer, nor like Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did R. Eliezer say that is unlike this Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> His opinion about the house (anything attached to the ground is like the ground) is unlike the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps he holds that one sells generously (but not everything attached is considered like the ground), and Chachamim hold that he sells stingily!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Eliezer's opinion about a beehive (coming up) is unlike the Beraisa.</p>
