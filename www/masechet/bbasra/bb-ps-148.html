<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW <i>MATNAS SHECHIV MERA</i> WORKS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Nachman taught that if a Shechiv Mera said 'the debt owed to me should be to Ploni', this takes effect, even though a healthy person cannot do this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> Matnas Shechiv Mera makes Ploni the heir (and heirs acquire debts), therefore he acquires the debt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> A healthy person can transfer a debt, like Rav Huna taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If Reuven tells Shimon in front of Levi 'you have money of mine. Give it to Levi', Levi acquires it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES THE GIVER RETAIN PART OF THE GIFT FOR HIMSELF?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> If a Shechiv Mera gave a date tree to Yehudah and its fruits to Moshe, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1A (Rashbam):</span> Do we say that he left the place from which the fruits grow (the branches) for Moshe, therefore he did not give all his land to Yehudah, so it is not considered a Matnas Shechiv Mera?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we say that he gave all his land to Yehudah, so it is a Matnas Shechiv Mera?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1B (Tosfos):</span> Do we say that he left for Moshe the place the fruits grow from, therefore Moshe acquires something already here (and what grows from it), so the gift is valid?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Or, did he leave for Moshe only the fruits that will grow, and one cannot transfer ownership of something that is not yet in the world, so the gift is invalid? (end of Version #1B)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If you will say that he did not leave (place on the tree) for Moshe, if he left the fruits for himself, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava citing Rav Nachman):</span> He left place on the tree for himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One leaves for himself generously.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Aba:</span> These questions were asked according to Reish Lakish!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If one sells a house and stipulates 'on condition that the top is mine', the roof is his.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">148b----------------------------------------148b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he gave a house to Yehudah and the roof to Moshe, what is the law? (Do we say that he left rights for Moshe to extend ledges from the roof, or not?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If you will say that he did not leave rights for Moshe, if he left the roof for himself, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava citing Rav Nachman):</span> If you will say that if one gave a house to Yehudah and the roof to Moshe, he did not leave rights for Moshe to extend ledges from the roof, if he left the roof for himself, he left for himself rights to extend ledges.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is according to Rav Zvid, who says that (since a roof surrounded by a 10-Tefachim wall is not included when a house is sold, even without a stipulation, therefore,) if he stipulated to keep the top, he reserves the rights to extend ledges.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef bar Minyomi):</span> If a Shechiv Mera wrote all his property to others, if he intended from the beginning to give away all his property, they all acquire after he dies (even though no Kinyan was made). If he recovers, he can retract the entire gift;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he originally intended to keep some of his property, and (after giving some) later decided to give the rest, (if they made Kinyanim) they all acquire after he dies (our text, Rambam; Me'iri - they acquire immediately). If he recovers, he can retract only the last gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Why can't he retract from the first gifts? Even if he paused in the middle, perhaps) he intended from the beginning to give away everything, and he paused to think about what was left to give!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, a Shechiv Mera first thinks about everything he has to give before he starts giving it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Minyomi):</span> If a Shechiv Mera wrote all his property to others, and he recovered, he cannot retract. We are concerned lest he has property abroad (that he did not give, therefore it is like the gift of a healthy person).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that if he did not keep property for himself, he can retract. Why are we not concerned?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chama):</span> The case is, he said 'I give all my property.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, we are Muchzak that he has no other property.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>RETRACTING PART OF A <i>MATNAS SHECHIV MERA</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (When he may retract,) if he retracted part of the gift, is this a retraction of the entire gift?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven said 'I give all my property to Ploni. I give some of it to Almoni', Almoni acquires, but Ploni does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Almoni acquires after Reuven dies, but Ploni does not. Retracting part of the gift to Ploni (i.e. what he gave to Almoni) is a retraction of the entire gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The case is, Reuven recovered. (The gift to Almoni was partial, therefore Reuven cannot retract from it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> If he said 'I give some of my property to Ploni. I give all of it to Almoni', Ploni acquires, but Almoni does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand why if Reuven recovered, he can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if Reuven died, both should acquire! (Reuven gave all his property. 'I give <i>all</i> of it to Almoni', means the rest!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yemar):</span> Even if the entire Beraisa discusses when he recovered, it shows that a partial retraction is a full retraction!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is a full retraction, this explains why Almoni acquires;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it were not a full retraction, Reuven gave all his property, and he would be able to retract also the gift to Almoni!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Halachah is, a partial retraction is a full retraction.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can explain the Reisha whether Reuven died or recovered. In the Seifa, we must say that he recovered.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MAY ONE RETRACT FROM HEKDESH AND HEFKER?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Shechiv Mera made all his property Hekdesh, and recovered, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that regarding Hekdesh, one decides absolutely to give it (even if he will recover)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we say that one never abandons himself (to be left without anything if he recovers)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he made all his property Hefker (and recovered), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that since also poor people can take Hefker, he decided absolutely to give it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we say that one never abandons himself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he gave all his property to the poor, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that regarding the Mitzvah of Tzedakah, surely he decided absolutely to give it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we say that one never abandons himself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>These questions are unsettled.</p>
