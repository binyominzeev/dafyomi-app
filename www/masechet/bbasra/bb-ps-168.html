<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CHACHAMIM DO NOT RECOGNIZE WOMEN SO WELL (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Yirmeyah bar Aba was signed on a receipt. The woman said that it was not written for her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah bar Aba:</span> It was written for you!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Even though a Chacham normally does not recognize women so well, if he is sure, he is sure!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> When a Chacham goes to be Mekadesh a woman, he should take an ignoramus with him, lest they give to him a different woman at the Nisu'in. (The ignoramus would recognize that she is not the same woman.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO PAYS THE SCRIBE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The husband pays the scribe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Chosav... v'Nosan" (the one who writes the Get must be the one who gives it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nowadays, the woman pays. Chachamim enacted this, lest the husband delay giving it (because he does not want to pay for it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may write a loan document for a borrower, even in the absence of the lender... (the borrower pays the scribe).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious (he benefits from the loan)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a Chidush regarding an Iska (the lender shares the profits).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may write a sale document for a seller, even in the absence of the buyer... (the buyer pays the scribe).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious (he benefits from the sale)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is when the field is sold due to its low quality (the seller benefits).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We write documents of Kidushin or Nisu'in only with consent of both parties (the Chasan pays the scribe).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious (he benefits more)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is when he is a Chacham. His father-in-law benefits more.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We write documents of Arisus or rental of land only with consent of both parties (the worker or renter pays the scribe).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is when he must leave the field fallow this year (he does not benefit now).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DOCUMENTS OF BEIS DIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We write documents of Birurin... only with consent of both parties.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a document of Birurin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Bavel):</span> It Mevarer (clarifies) the claims.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> It says which judge each party Birer (chose) to hear the case. (The two judges choose the third judge.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> One copy is written for each party.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim and R. Shimon ben Gamliel argue about whether or not Kofin Al Midas Sedom (we force one to benefit others if he will not lose):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that one (either party) can force the other to share the cost of one document. R. Shimon ben Gamliel says that one cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree that Kofin Al Midas Sedom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says that one can refuse to have the claims of both sides written together (Rashbam - lest constantly seeing the other's claims will cause friction).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DOES ASMACHTA ACQUIRE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> If Reuven paid part of his debt to Shimon, and fixed a date and gave the document to Levi and said 'if I do not pay the rest by this date, give the document to Shimon (who may then collect the full amount)', and Reuven did not pay in time, Levi gives the document to Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, he does not give it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi says that Asmachta (an exaggerated promise) is binding. R. Yehudah holds that it is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows (text of Tosfos - does not follow) R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>When people would come in front of R. Ami, he would say 'R. Yochanan taught that the Halachah follows R. Yosi. How can I argue?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Halachah does not follow R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>A FADED DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Ploni's document faded (or was about to fade), he gets witnesses who know (or shows them before it fades) what was written, and comes to Beis Din. Beis Din writes a Kiyum: Ploni's document faded. (It was dated) on this day; the witnesses were Almoni and...</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">168b----------------------------------------168b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> The Kiyum is 'we three judges sat, Reuven and..., Ploni showed us that his document was faded, the date was..., the witnesses were Almoni and...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If the Kiyum says 'we heard the witnesses' testimony. It was proper', Ploni can collect through the Kiyum. He does not need proof (of the date of the original document). If not, he must bring proof (of the original date).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If a document was torn (by a person), it is invalid. If it became torn by itself, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If it was erased or smudged, if the imprint of the writing is still visible, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the cases of being torn (by a person) and torn by itself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Torn by a person is when Beis Din tears it. 'Torn by itself' refers to any other tear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Beis Din tear a document?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> They tear the place of the witnesses, the date and the Toref (the crucial information, i.e. the parties, the amount of the loan...).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> They tear it lengthwise and widthwise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Some Yishmaelim came to Pumbadisa. They would forcibly take people's land. The owners brought their documents to Abaye, and asked him to write new ones, in case the originals will be taken.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> I cannot. Rav Safra taught (169a) that we do not write two documents for one field, lest the field be collected by a creditor of the seller (Reuven), and the buyer (Shimon) will take land from someone who bought from Reuven after Shimon (and give to him one document), then Shimon will take land from someone else who bought from Reuven (and give to him the other document).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The owners were pressuring Abaye. He told his scribe to write documents for them on erased parchment, and the witnesses should sign on clear parchment (such documents are invalid).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Perhaps [they will erase the latter writing, and] the imprint of the writing of the first document will still be visible (if it was not erased well). The Beraisa teaches that Beis Din makes a Kiyum in such a case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> The scribe will not write over an erased document. Rather, he will write 'Aleph-Beis', erase it, and then write for these people.</p>
