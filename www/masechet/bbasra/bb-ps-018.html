<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(The coming nine questions are against Rava in the first version.) Question #1: This implies that if his neighbor did not have a wall there, he would not have to distance himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, even if there is no wall there, he must distance himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did the Mishnah teach these cases?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that these things damage walls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may not plant seeds, plow, or urinate within three Tefachim of his neighbor's wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> This implies that if his neighbor did not have a wall there, he would not have to distance himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, even if there is no wall there, he must distance himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did the Mishnah teach these cases?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that moisture damages walls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The lower stone of a millstone must be distanced three Tefachim. The upper stone will be four Tefachim away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> This implies that if his neighbor did not have a wall there, he would not have to distance himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, even if there is no wall there, he must distance himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what does the Mishnah teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that making the ground shake damages walls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The bottom of an oven must be distanced three Tefachim. The top will be four Tefachim away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> This implies that if his neighbor did not have a wall there, he would not have to distance himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, even if there is no wall there, he must distance himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what does the Mishnah teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that heat damage walls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not open a bakery or dyer's store or cattle pen under someone else's storehouse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question #5:</span> This implies that if there was not a storehouse there, he would be allowed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are more lenient for necessities of living.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> If the cattle pen preceded the storehouse, he may keep it there.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DISTANCING TREES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not plant a tree within four Amos of his neighbor's field.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Four Amos is the amount needed for upkeep of a vineyard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #6:</span> This implies that if not for the field, he would not have to distance himself, even though the roots will damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the case is, a deep rock (below ground) separates the fields. (The roots will not penetrate.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there is a wall between the fields, each may plant close to the wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #7:</span> He need not distance himself, even though the roots will damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, a deep rock separates the fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From the Seifa, we may infer that no rock separates the fields!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If the roots entered his neighbor's field, the neighbor may cut them up to three Tefachim below the ground, so it should not impede his plow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means that if no rock separates the fields, and the roots entered his neighbor's field, the neighbor may cut them up to three Tefachim below the ground, so it should not impede his plow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not plant a tree within 25 Amos of his neighbor's pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #8:</span> This implies that if his neighbor did not have a pit there, he would not have to distance himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, even if there is no pit there, he must distance himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches that roots can damage a pit up to 25 Amos away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa teaches that if the tree preceded the pit, it may not be cut down. If one must distance himself even when there is no pit there, how was he allowed to have the tree close?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We answer like Rav Papa said (elsewhere), that when Reuven planted the tree, he owned the nearby field. Later, he sold it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MUST THE DAMAGER DISTANCE HIMSELF?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We distance soaking water (of flax) from vegetables, and leeks from onions, and mustard from bees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #9:</span> This implies that if his neighbor did not have vegetables there, he would not have to distance himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, even if there are no vegetables there, he must distance himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches that these things damage one another.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa teaches otherwise!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah and Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> One may plant mustard near his neighbor's bees. He can say 'rather than tell me to distance my mustard, distance your bees, for they eat the stems of my mustard plants!'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one must distance damagers from the border (even when there is no pit there), both of them must distance themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> When Reuven set up the soaking pit, leeks or mustard, he owned the adjacent field. Later, he sold it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why do Chachamim say that he must distance himself?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This question also applies to R. Yosi, who agrees in the first two cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> Chachamim hold that the potential damager must distance himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Yosi holds that the victim must distance himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, in all three cases R. Yosi should not require him to distance himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, R. Yosi agrees that the damager must distance himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He agrees about water and leeks, since these damage (vegetables and onions) but are not damaged.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Bees also damage mustard, therefore one need not distance his mustard from the bees.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim hold that bees do not damage mustard.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They do not find the seeds;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Even though they eat the leaves, they grow back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yosi does not hold that the damager must distance himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> Even though the pit preceded the tree, we do not cut down the tree. The owner of the pit digs in his field, and the owner of the tree plants in his field!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Defense of Answer #1):</span> Really, R. Yosi holds that the victim must distance himself. He addresses Chachamim according to their reasoning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> I hold that the victim must distance himself, even regarding soaking water and vegetables;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Granted, in such a case, you hold that the damager must distance himself, since he damages but is not damaged;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>You should admit about bees and mustard, that neither must distance himself, for each damages the other!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that bees do not damage mustard, for they do not find the seeds. Even though they eat the leaves, they grow back.</p>
