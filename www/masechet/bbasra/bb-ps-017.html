<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SOME REWARDS OF THE GREATEST TZADIKIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Hash-m gave three people a taste of the world to come: Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They were blessed with "ba'kol", "mi'Kol", and "Kol" respectively.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This also shows that these are the only three over whom the evil inclination did not rule.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Some say, also David was not under its rule - "v'Libi Chalal b'Kirbi"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The first Tana holds that David merely expressed his pain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The angel of death did not rule over six people: Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov (as above), and Moshe, Aharon and Miryam who died "Al Pi Hash-m".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It does not say "Al Pi Hash-m" regarding Miryam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> A Gezeirah Shavah "Sham-Sham" teaches that Miryam also died through Hash-m's kiss!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not proper for the Torah to say this explicitly, so it did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Seven people were not consumed by worms after death: Avraham, Yitzchak, Yakov, Moshe, Aharon and Miryam (as above), and Binyamin ("Yishkon la'Vetach").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Some say, also David was not - "Ach Besari Yishkon la'Vetach".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana holds that this was a request for mercy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Four people died only due to (Adam's sin through) the snake: Binyamin, Amram, Yishai, and David's son Kalev.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Avigayil Bas Nachash", even though she was Yishai's daughter, to teach that he died only due to the snake.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We have a tradition about the other three.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DISTANCING TO PREVENT DAMAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not dig a (round) pit close to his neighbor's pit, nor may he dig a long or roofed pit, or an irrigation channel, or a laundry ditch, unless he distances three Tefachim (handbreadths) from his neighbor's pit, and plasters the wall of the pit;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One must distance the refuse of olives, manure, salt, lime, and rocks three Tefachim from his neighbor's wall, and/or apply plaster;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may not plant seeds, plow, or put urine within three Tefachim of his neighbor's wall;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The lower stone of a millstone must be distanced three Tefachim, and the upper stone will be four Tefachim away;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The bottom of an oven must be distanced three Tefachim, and the top will be four Tefachim away.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Mishnah first says 'he must distance from a pit'; then it says 'from the wall'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It means, from the wall of his pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't it just say 'he distances three Tefachim from his neighbor's pit?'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches that the wall of a pit should be three Tefachim. (The interior of one's pit is three Tefachim from his neighbor's wall; we assume that his neighbor's wall fills the three Tefachim he needed to distance from the border.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is relevant to commerce.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sells a pit and its wall, the wall must be three Tefachim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DISTANCING FROM THE BORDER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One may dig a pit at the edge of his property if his neighbor does not have a pit nearby;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> No, he must distance three Tefachim from the border.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> In a type of field in which people generally dig pits, all agree that he must distance from the border;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>They argue when it is the type in which people generally do not dig pits.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye allows him to dig at the edge, for in such a field, we do not expect that the neighbor will want to dig a pit (nearby);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava says that he must distance three Tefachim from the border. Just like he decided to dig a pit in such a field, perhaps his neighbor will also want to.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> In a type of field in which people do not generally dig pits, all agree that he may dig up to the border;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>They argue when it is the type in which people generally dig pits.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye allows him to dig at the edge.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even Chachamim, who forbid planting a tree within 25 Amos of a neighbor's pit, say so only about an existing pit. Here, there is no pit when he digs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava says that he must distance three Tefachim from the border.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even R. Yosi, who says that just like Shimon may dig in is his own property, his neighbor may plant in his own property, and need not distance himself, says so only about planting, because the roots that will cause the damage are not present when he plants;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Here, every shovel full of dirt excavated softens the neighboring land, so he must distance himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man may not dig a pit near his neighbor's pit ...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is only because his neighbor has a pit there. If not, he would not have to distance himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> We understand according to Version #2. In a type of field in which people do not generally dig pits, all agree that he may dig up to the border;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah discusses a field in which people generally do not dig pits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>According to the first version, they argue about a field in which people generally do not dig pits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>We understand according to Abaye (it is such a field).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah is difficult for Rava!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Abaye himself taught that the Mishnah says that Reuven must distance himself from the (potential) wall of his neighbor's pit (i.e. even if he is the first to dig).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2: (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah says that Reuven must distance himself from the (potential) wall of his neighbor's pit (i.e. even if he is the first to dig).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand according to Version #1 (of the dispute between Abaye and Rava). In a type of field in which people generally dig pits, all agree that he must distance himself. The Mishnah discusses a field in which people generally dig pits.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Version #2, they argue about a field in which people generally dig pits.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah is like Rava (it is such a field), but it is difficult for Abaye!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah discusses when both neighbors come to dig pits at the same time (therefore, each must distance himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One who wants to dig a pit in land in which the dirt is brittle must distance himself three Tefachim, and plaster. (This refutes Abaye in Version #2.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is no refutation. Brittle dirt has a different law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, the Beraisa chose the case for this reason. Why didn't the one who asked the question anticipate this answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He thought that the Beraisa chose the case of brittle dirt to show that even then, it suffices to distance three Tefachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One must distance manure, salt, lime, rocks and the refuse of olives three Tefachim from his neighbor's wall, and apply plaster.</p>
