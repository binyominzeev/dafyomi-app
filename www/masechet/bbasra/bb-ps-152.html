<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN IS A KINYAN REQUIRED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Bei Rav citing Rav):</span> If a Matnas Shechiv Mera mentions that a Kinyan was made, the giver gave the receiver the advantage of the gift of a healthy person <i>and</i> the gift of a Shechiv Mera;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> I do not know how to judge it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav says he gets the advantages of both. It is like the gift of a healthy person, i.e. even if the giver recovers, he cannot retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is like the gift of a Shechiv Mera, i.e. if he gave a loan, the receiver acquires it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel is unsure how to judge it. Perhaps the giver wanted it to be acquired only through the document, and a document does not work posthumously.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Rav and Shmuel both contradict themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ravin citing Rav):</span> If a Matnas Shechiv Mera said 'write and give 100 Zuz to Ploni', and the giver died, we do not give it. Perhaps the giver wanted it to be acquired only through the document, and a document does not work posthumously.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah is, we write and give it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> Rav says he gets the advantages of both only when a Kinyan was done.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> Shmuel only says that we write and give it when the giver gives the receiver more rights (this will be explained. A regular Kinyan does not prove that this was the giver's intention).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Did Shmuel really say that perhaps the giver only wanted it to be acquired through the document, and a document does not work posthumously'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yehudah cited Shmuel to say that if a Shechiv Mera wrote all his property to others, even though a Kinyan was made, if he recovers, he can retract. Surely, he gave only because he expected to die; (but if he died, we give the gift)!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Nachman gestured to Rava. Rava understood the answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> What did his gesture mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> The case is, the giver gave the receiver more rights.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of giving the receiver more rights?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It says 'v'Kanina Minei (the witnesses acquired from the giver on behalf of the receiver) in addition to this gift.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>The following is obvious. If a Shechiv Mera (Reuven) wrote to Shimon and then to Levi, Rav Dimi's law applies:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> A Daitiki (document of a Matnas Shechiv Mera) nullifies a previous Daitiki (because it shows that the giver retracted).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A GIFT WITH <i>ZECHIYAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Chachamim of Sura - (Rav):</span> If Reuven wrote a document and was Mezakeh for Shimon (Rashbam - gave to him the document; Tosfos - asked someone to acquire the property for Shimon, and wrote this in the document) and then wrote and was Mezakeh for Levi, Shimon acquires;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Levi acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav says that Shimon acquires. (Because he was Mezakeh,) this is like a gift of a healthy person;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel says that Levi acquires. It is a Matnas Shechiv Mera.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They already argued about this, i.e. a Matnas Shechiv Mera that says that a Kinyan was made!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They needed to argue in both cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1A (our text, Tosfos):</span> Had they argued only here, one might have thought that only here Rav considers it like a gift of a healthy person, because someone acquired the property on behalf of Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had they argued only there, one might have thought that only there Shmuel argues, but here he would admit to Rav, for someone acquired the property for Shimon. (Really, there was no need to prove that we must hear Shmuel's opinion in both cases. Above, Shmuel said that we do not give the gift, for perhaps he intended to give it only through a document!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1B (Rashbam):</span> Had they argued only there, one might have thought that only there Rav considers it like a gift of a healthy person, because a Kinyan was done;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Had they argued only here, one might have thought that only here Shmuel argues, because no Kinyan was done.</p>
