<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE KERUVIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> It says "veha'Bayis... u'Shloshim Amah Komaso", and it says "v'Esrim Amah Komaso"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> The latter verse gives the height above the Keruvim (the figures on the cover of the Aron).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that the space above is like the space below: just like nothing occupies the space above (it is empty), also the space below (the 10 Amos in which the Keruvim stand, miraculously) does not occupy space (as we will explain).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This supports R. Levi,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> We have a tradition that the Aron and Keruvim do not occupy space.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> The Aron Moshe made was surrounded by 10 Amos in every direction (even though the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim was only 20 by 20, i.e. it did not occupy any space).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Ravnai):</span> The (two) Keruvim stood miraculously - "V'Chamesh Amos Kenaf ha'Keruv ha'Echas v'Chamesh Amos Kenaf ha'Keruv ha'Shenis..." (They stood next to each other, and the total span of all four wings was 20 Amos, i.e. the entire length of the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim. We conclude that their bodies (in between the wings) did not occupy space!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Abaye):</span> Perhaps (there was no miracle;) the wings of each Keruv touched each other, and the bodies were underneath, like chickens!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rava):</span> Perhaps they did not stand next to each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection #3 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> (Even if they stood next to each other,) perhaps they were on a diagonal (which is about 28 Amos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection #4 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Perhaps the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim is 20 by 20 at the bottom, but it is wider on top!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection #5 (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps the wings were bent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection #6 (Rav Ashi):</span> Perhaps the wings overlapped each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the (normal) position of the Keruvim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan or R. Elazar):</span> Each faced the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (the other of R. Yochanan and R. Elazar):</span> Each faced the walls of the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (against the first opinion):</span> "U'Fneihem la'Bayis"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When Yisrael does Hash-m's will, they face each other. when we do not, they face the walls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (against the second opinion):</span> "U'Fneihem Ish El Achiv"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They face each other somewhat, and also face the walls somewhat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Unkelos):</span> "Keruvim Shnayim Ma'ase Tza'atzu'im" - (their faces) looked like children leaving their Rebbi, i.e., looking slightly to the side.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO OWNS PROPERTY IN ANOTHER'S DOMAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Mishnah):</span> If Reuven owns a pit in Shimon's house, he enters and leaves at normal times (i.e. by day);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He may not bring his animal in, rather, he takes water out for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven and Shimon each make a key (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> For what are the keys?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Both are for the pit (neither can open it without the other).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why Reuven has a key, in order to prevent Shimon from stealing water;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why does Shimon make a key?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">99b----------------------------------------99b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> To prevent suspicion that Reuven entered to be with Shimon's wife (now, he will enter only when Shimon is home).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Levi owns a garden inside Yehudah's garden, he enters and leaves at normal times;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may not bring in merchants, nor may he enter Yehudah's garden in order to get to a different field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Yehudah has the right to seed the path.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If Levi received a path on the side (of Yehudah's garden) by mutual consent, he enters and leaves at any time he wants. He may bring in merchants. He may not enter Yehudah's garden in order to get to a different field, and neither may seed it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> If Shimon bought an Amah (irrigation channel) in Reuven's Beis ha'Shelachin (irrigated field), he gets two Amos, one on each bank. (Some say that also, if the channel is less than two Amos, he may widen it to two Amos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he bought an Amah Kilon (water trough for animals), he gets one Amah, half on each side (Some say, if the trough is less than one Amah, he may widen it to one Amah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who may plant on the banks?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> Reuven seeds them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> Reuven plants (trees on) them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>All the more so, Rav Yehudah permits Reuven to plant trees. Since trees have deep roots, they will not harm the banks.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nachman forbids Reuven to seed the banks, for this will moisten the ground and weaken the banks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If the banks of Shimon's Amah fell, he can fix it with dirt of Reuven's field. Surely, the dirt scattered onto the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> Reuven can say that the banks did not fall, rather, the water level rose (and Reuven has no dirt of Shimon)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, he can fix it with dirt of Reuven's field because this was (an understood) condition of the sale.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LAWS OF PATHS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Reshus ha'Rabim passed through Reuven's field, and Reuven set aside the end of his field for people to walk on, intending to take over the area of the old path, the new path also becomes a Reshus ha'Rabim, and Reuven may not take the area he wanted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(One who buys) a private road is (entitled to at least) four Amos. A Reshus ha'Rabim is 16 Amos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>There is no limit to the road for a king or a funeral procession.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Judges of Tzipori say, we allow an area of Beis Arba'ah Kavim (about 1667 square Amos) for a Ma'amad (a place where people stop when returning from a burial).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why didn't Chachamim enact that Reuven gets the old path? He should be allowed to take a stick and hit anyone who walks on the old path!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that one may not take the law into his own hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rav Zvid):</span> Chachamim decreed that he does not get the path he wanted, lest he give a crooked path in its stead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> The case is, he gave them a crooked path in its stead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> Any replacement path he gives is considered a crooked path, for it is closer for some people, but further for others.</p>
