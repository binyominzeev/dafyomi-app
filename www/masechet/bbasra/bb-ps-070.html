<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH TREES ARE EXCLUDED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> He excludes only trees so tall that one needs a rope to climb up (to harvest it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Judges of Bavel):</span> Only trees that impede a plowing ox from passing by are excluded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They do not argue. Rav discusses date trees, and judges of Bavel discuss other trees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (Rav Acha bar Huna):</span> If he sold 'except for carob (or sycamore) Ploni (a mature tree, it would be excluded anyway)', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is that the only (mature) carob excluded, or are all excluded (as if he kept quiet)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> He does not acquire the others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If he sold 'except for carob (or sycamore) Ploni', he does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that he does not acquire it, but he acquires the others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he does not acquire the others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> If he said 'I sell to you my field, except for field Ploni', does he acquire all the fields except for Ploni?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, he does not. Also here, he does not acquire the others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (Rav Acha bar Huna):</span> If he sold 'except for half of carob (or sycamore) Ploni', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, the others are excluded. Does the buyer get the other half of carob Ploni, or not even that?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> He does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If he sold 'except for half of carob (or sycamore) Ploni', he does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that he does not acquire the others, but he acquires half of Ploni.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he does not acquire even half of Ploni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> If he said 'I sell to you my field, except for half of field Ploni', does he acquire half of field Ploni?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, he does not. Also here, he does not acquire the other half.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A MIGO AGAINST A DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Amram):</span> If Reuven deposited (something) with Shimon with a document, and Shimon claims 'I returned it to you', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that since Shimon would be believed to claim 'it was lost through Ones', he is believed to say 'I returned it'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since Reuven still has the document, this proves that he did not return it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> Shimon is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Amram):</span> If he returned it, why does Reuven still have the document?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> (Shimon returned it even though Reuven said that he lost the document. He was not afraid lest Reuven later claim with the document, for) if Shimon would say that it was lost through Ones, the document would not disprove this!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">70b----------------------------------------70b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Amram):</span> Shimon would have to swear (that it was lost through Ones)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> I meant that Shimon is believed if he swears (that he returned it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Amram and Rav Chisda argue like the following Tana'im:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - judges of Bavel):</span> If Levi brought a Shtar Kis (document of a business venture) against orphans, he swears (that their father never paid) and collects it all;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Judges of Eretz Yisrael say, he swears and collects half.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>All agree with Chachamim of Neharde'a, that Shtar Kis is half a loan, and half a deposit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Judges of Bavel say that since Levi has the document, this proves that he was not paid;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Judges of Eretz Yisrael say that their father would be believed to say that the money (or merchandise) was lost through Ones, which would exempt him from paying half (the deposit), therefore he would also be believed to say 'I returned it';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Therefore, we claim on behalf of the orphans, that perhaps their father paid half. (They swear that they do not know that their father still owed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree with Rav Chisda (the Migo is believed against the document);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Judges of Bavel say that had he paid half, he would have told his children;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Judges of Eretz Yisrael hold that perhaps he died suddenly, and was unable to tell them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Huna bar Avin):</span> If Reuven deposited with Shimon with a document, Shimon is believed to say 'I returned it';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Levi brings Shtar Kis against orphans, he swears and collects it all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> These laws contradict each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Had the father paid half, he would have told his children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is, he swears and collects half.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> The Halachah follows the judges of Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> Rava said that he collects only half!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Mar Zutra:</span> Our text of the Beraisa switches the opinions. Judges of Bavel say that he collects half.</p>
