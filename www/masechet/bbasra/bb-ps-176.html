<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A DOCUMENT IN THE BORROWER'S HANDWRITING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven presents a document in Shimon's handwriting saying that Shimon owes him, he collects from Bnei Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Noson):</span> If Beis Din validated such a document, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> (It does not become like a proper document. Still) he only collects from Bnei Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama - Mishnah):</span> There are three kinds of Gitin that are Pasul (mid'Rabanan). If a woman remarried relying on such a Get, the children are not Mamzerim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The husband wrote it in his own handwriting, witnesses did not sign;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Witnesses signed, but it has no date;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It has a date, but only one witness signed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Eliezer says, even if no witnesses signed, if he gave it to her in front of witnesses, it is Kosher, and (Rashbam - such a loan document; one version in Rashi - the Kesuvah) can be collected from Meshubadim (sold property).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashbam) Answer:</span> That case is different, for from the time he wrote the document (intending to give it in front of witnesses), he obligated himself (therefore, it is like a proper loan document).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi) Answer:</span> That case is different, for from the time (i.e. of Nisu'in) that he became responsible to pay her Kesuvah (if she will be widowed or divorced) he obligated himself (and this is known to all).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TESTIMONY ON ARVUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an Arev accepted Arvus in a document underneath the signatures...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If he signed before the signatures, the lender collects even from Meshubadim. If he signed after the signatures, he collects from Bnei Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> A different time, Rav taught that even if he signed before the signatures, the lender collects only from Bnei Chorin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he wrote 'Ploni is an Arev', this is a new matter. The signatures do not refer to it. It is as if he signed after the signatures (he collects only from Bnei Chorin);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he wrote '<i>and</i> Ploni is an Arev', this is part of the document. The signatures testify also about it (so he collects even from Meshubadim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> In either case ('Ploni is an Arev' or 'And Ploni'), he only collects from Bnei Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he really say that if he wrote 'And Ploni is an Arev', he only collects from Bnei Chorin?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a personal note ('give my regards...') was appended to a Get and witnesses signed underneath it, the Get is Pasul. We are concerned lest they signed only on the greeting, and not on the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Amah citing R. Yochanan):</span> If it says 'give my regards', it is Pasul. If it says '<i>and</i> give...' it is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When R. Yochanan said 'in either case', he meant that whether he signed before or after the signatures, he only collects from Bnei Chorin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, he wrote 'Ploni is an Arev' (without 'and').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he agrees with Rav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, it should say 'and also R. Yochanan said...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in which R. Yishmael said that he collects from Bnei Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Even though R. Yishmael praised Ben Nanas, the Halachah follows R. Yishmael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yishmael say in a case of choking? (Is the Arev obligated?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yakov said that R. Yishmael argues even in a case of choking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the Halachah follow R. Yishmael there?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ravin said that R. Yishmael argues even in a case of choking, and the Halachah follows him even there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> In a case of choking, if the Arev made a Kinyan to obligate himself, he is obligated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it was not a case of choking, no Kinyan is required!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This argues with Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">176b----------------------------------------176b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> An Arev of Beis Din does not need a Kinyan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A regular Arev needs a Kinyan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>The Halachah is, an Arev at the time of the loan does not need a Kinyan. An Arev after the money was given needs a Kinyan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An Arev of Beis Din does not need a Kinyan. With the benefit that he is trusted, he decides absolutely to obligate himself.</p>
