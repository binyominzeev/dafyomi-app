<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>INCREASING TRAFFIC IN THE CHATZER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he bought a house in another Chatzer, he may not make an entrance to the joint Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This would cause more people (i.e. those of the other Chatzer, who now have a shorter path) to walk through the joint Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> He may add an interior room or a second story onto his house, and make the entrance to his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This will cause more people (tenants in the added room) to walk through the joint Chatzer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> He did not build onto his house, he merely split an existing room into two (an inner and outer room, or he built a ceiling at half the height of the room, splitting the room into a lower room and an upper story).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OPENINGS THAT REDUCE PRIVACY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not open a door opposite a door in a joint Chatzer, nor a window opposite a window;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may not make an opening larger, nor split it into two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may open a door opposite a door across a Reshus ha'Rabim, or a window opposite a window;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may make an opening larger, or split it into two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source (of the first law)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> "Va'Yar Es Yisrael Shochen li'Shvatav" - Bilam saw that the openings of their tents do not face each other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that they are worthy for the Divine Presence to rest on them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may not make an opening larger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> This means, he may not enlarge an opening of four Amos to eight, for this would entitle him to a larger share of the Chatzer (when they will divide it, one gets an area (for unloading) for each opening, (no less than four Amos, up to) the length of the opening), but he may enlarge an opening of two Amos to four (since in any case he gets four Amos for it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> No. The partners in the Chatzer can say 'a larger opening decreases our privacy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may not split it into two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> This means, he may not split an opening of four Amos into two openings of two each, for this would entitle him to a larger share of the Chatzer, but he may split an opening of eight Amos into two openings of four each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Even though is forbidden. The partners in the Chatzer can say 'more openings decreases our privacy.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may open a door opposite a door across a Reshus ha'Rabim, or a window opposite a window.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This is because in any case they have no privacy, for people are always walking by.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DAMAGE TO THE RESHUS HA'RABIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not make a pit under a Reshus ha'Rabim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer permits this, if the cover can support a wagon laden with rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may not extend ledges or balconies into a Reshus ha'Rabim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may recess his house from the Reshus ha'Rabim, and extend them up to the Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one buys a Chatzer with ledges or balconies extending into the Reshus ha'Rabim, he has a Chazakah that these were built properly (according to the above law).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The first Tana argues with R. Eliezer, for sometimes the cover will get weaker, and he (one who passes over) will not know (and it will collapse under him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not extend ledges or balconies into a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Ami had a ledge extending into a Mavuy (alleyway). Ploni had a ledge extending into the Reshus ha'Rabim. People complained that Ploni's ledge was impeding them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> You must remove it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Ploni:</span> Also you have a ledge that juts out!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> My ledge extends into a Mavuy, and the people pardon it. Yours extends into a Reshus ha'Rabim. How will you get everyone's pardon?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yanai had a tree whose foliage hung over a Reshus ha'Rabim. Also Almoni had such a tree. People complained that Almoni's tree was impeding them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yanai told Almoni to return tomorrow. That night, R. Yanai cut his foliage.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yanai (the next day):</span> You must cut the foliage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Almoni:</span> Also you have such a tree!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yanai:</span> If mine is cut, also you must cut yours.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Originally, R. Yanai did not cut his tree. Why did he change his mind?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> At first, he thought that people preferred the shade. When he heard that it impedes people, he cut it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he tell Almoni immediately to cut his tree?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was due to Reish Lakish's teaching;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Hiskosheshu va'Koshu" - first fix yourself, then correct others.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE WHO RECESSED HIS HOUSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may recess his house from the Reshus ha'Rabim, and extend (a ledge...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he recessed his house and did not extend, may he extend it later?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> He may.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> He may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Yakov):</span> All agree that he may extend. They argue whether he may return the walls (of his house) until the original border (between his property and the Reshus ha'Rabim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> He may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> He may.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan holds like Rav Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may not ruin a path in which the public was Machazik.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Reish Lakish says that this does not apply here, for there enough room for people will remain (like before he recessed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one buys a Chatzer with ledges and balconies extending into the Reshus ha'Rabim, he has a Chazakah that these were built properly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If the ledges fell, he may rebuild them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Due to mourning over the Churban, we may not plaster, or make pictures on the walls;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one bought a plastered or pictured Chatzer, he may keep it that way. If it fell, he may not rebuild it like it was.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is an Isur; it is different. (The buyer must conduct like a mourner. A ledge is a monetary question. Since we assume that the seller recessed, the property belongs to the buyer).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>MOURNING OVER THE CHURBAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not plaster his house. If he mixed in sand or straw, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, if he mixed in sand, this is Trachsid (cement), and it is forbidden. If he mixed in straw, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> After the Churban, many Perushim (pious people) abstained from meat and wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Why are you abstaining from meat and wine?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Perushim:</span> How can we eat them? They used to be offered on the Altar, and now they are not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Nor should we eat bread! Also Menachos were offered, and now they are not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Perushim:</span> Indeed, we will not eat bread! We will eat other Peros to survive.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Nor should we eat fruits (of the seven species)! Bikurim were offered from them, and now they are not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Perushim:</span> Indeed, we will not eat fruits of the seven species.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Nor should we drink water! Water was offered on Sukos and now it is not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>The Perushim had no answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> We must mourn, but we should not mourn too much;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ba'Me'erah... Kove'im ha'Goy Kulo" - we do not make decrees that the congregation cannot endure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Chachamim said that one may plaster his house, but he leaves a small amount unplastered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much must he leave?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> He leaves a square Amah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> He leaves it opposite the entrance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>One may make a lavish banquet, but he omits a small thing (that otherwise he would have served).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he omit?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> He omits fish fried in its oil with flour.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A woman may apply all her cosmetics, but she omits something small.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does she omit?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> She does not apply plaster to her temples (to make the hair fall out - Rashbam; Rambam - she omits one ornament).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "Im Eshkachech Yerushalayim... Al Rosh Simchasi" refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> A Chasan puts ashes on his head.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Where on the head does he put them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He puts them in the place where Tefilin are worn - "Pe'er Tachas Efer."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Everyone who mourns over Yerushalayim will merit to see its Simchah - "Simchu Es Yerushalayim... Kol ha'Mis'abelim Aleha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael ben Elisha):</span> After the Churban, we should have decreed not to eat meat and wine, but we do not make decrees that the congregation cannot endure;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Romi seized power, and makes evil harsh decrees against us, impeding our Torah and Mitzvos. They do not let us go to circumcisions (some say - Yeshu'a ha'Ben (Aruch - redemption of a firstborn));</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Due to this, we should have decreed not to marry or have children, but then the seed of Avraham would die out;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is better that Yisraelim not realize that it is improper to marry and have children, than that they should know and intentionally transgress.</p>
