<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MAKING A STOLEN ANIMAL <i>HEKDESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven stole an animal, was Makdish it, and slaughtered or sold it (he only pays Kefel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We understand why he does not pay four or five for slaughtering it. He slaughters the animal of Hekdesh, not of the original owner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should pay four or five for making it Hekdesh. Giving to Hekdesh is like selling to a person!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Shimon, who says that Kodshim with Achrayus are considered to be in the Reshus of the original owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since R. Shimon taught the Seifa, the Reisha is not R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Mishnah discusses Kodshei Kalim. It is like R. Yosi ha'Glili, who holds that they are considered the property of the owner, and are in the owner's Reshus (jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would he say that one pays four or five for Kodshei Kodoshim</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If so, why does the Reisha teach that if he stole an animal, slaughtered it and made it Hekdesh, he pays four or five? It should distinguish within the case of slaughtering after making it Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It should say that he is exempt from four or five only for Kodshei Kalim, but for Kodshei Kodoshim, he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even for Kodshei Kodoshim, he is exempt. We distinguish between giving to Hekdesh and selling to a person;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When one sells to a person, the animal changes from being Shimon's ox to Levi's ox;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When one gives to Hekdesh, it is called Shimon's ox before and after the Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE EXEMPTION OF <i>HEKDESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Shimon says...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, R. Shimon does not distinguish between giving to Hekdesh and selling to a person, but he should say oppositely!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For Kodshim with act, he should be exempt, for they are still in the original owner's Reshus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For Kodshim without Achrayus, he should be liable, for they leave the original owner's Reshus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon refers to a different matter (our Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one steals from a thief, or steals Hekdesh from its owner's house, he does not pay four or five.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he exempt for Hekdesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "And it was stolen from the man's house" - not from the house of Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon says, he is liable (four or five) for Kodshim with Achrayus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is considered stealing from the owner's house (only) if there is Achrayus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon holds that slaughter that does not permit the meat is not considered slaughter. Slaughter of Kodshim (outside the Mikdash) forbids the meat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Dimi, citing R. Yochanan):</span> The case is, it was Tam (unblemished), and he slaughtered it in the Mikdash, Lishmah (for the sake of the owner).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the owner fulfilled his obligation. It is as if he returned the animal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Avin):</span> The blood spilled (invalidating the Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravin, citing R. Yochanan):</span> It was Tam, and he slaughtered it in the Mikdash Lo Lishmah. (The meat may be eaten, but he did not fulfill his obligation.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">76b----------------------------------------76b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Reish Lakish):</span> It was blemished, and he slaughtered it outside the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SOMETHING THAT WAS FITTING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Elazar):</span> These slaughters do not permit the meat (until another act is done)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Slaughter of a Tam does not permit it. Throwing the blood permits it! Slaughter of a blemished Korban does not permit it. Redemption permits it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon holds that whenever the blood is destined to be thrown (i.e. after slaughter), it is as if it was thrown (i.e. as if slaughter permits the animal immediately);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He also holds that whenever an animal is destined to be redeemed (i.e. after slaughter), we view it as if it was redeemed (and permitted immediately).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Sometimes, Nosar (Kodshim that was not eaten in the allowed time, and is now forbidden) receives Tum'ah like food. Sometimes, it does not:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the time for eating passed and the blood was never thrown, it does not receive Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If the blood was thrown in time, it receives Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We hold that this means that if the blood was never ready to be thrown, it does not receive Tum'ah. If it was ready, it receives Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered ready or not ready to be thrown?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was slaughtered right before sunset, there was no time to throw it, it was not ready; if it was slaughtered with enough time to throw it, it was ready.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that anything ready to be thrown, it is as if it was thrown (and the meat receives Tum'ah).</p>
