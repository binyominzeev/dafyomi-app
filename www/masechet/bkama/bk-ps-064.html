<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SOURCE FOR PAYING <i>KEFEL</i>, FOUR AND FIVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Tana d'Vei Chizkiyah):</span> The Torah should have said only 'ox' and 'theft', and we would know that Kefel applies to everything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the only example (of a stolen object) was 'ox', we would include only animals that are offered on the Mizbe'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This would include a Seh. However, the verse also says "Seh"! We must say that "theft..." includes everything! (The Gemara proceeds to explain this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It would have sufficed to write 'ox, Seh, theft'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, we would learn only animals whose firstborn have Kedushah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This would include a donkey. However, the verse explicitly says "donkey"! We must say that "theft..." includes everything!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It would have sufficed to write 'ox, donkey, Seh, theft'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, we would include only living things.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The verse says also "living"! We must say that ("theft...") includes everything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Tana d'Vei Chizkiyah say 'had the Torah said only 'ox' and 'theft''? "Theft" is written before "ox"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Tana means 'had the Torah written 'ox... theft...'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, 'ox' would be a Prat, and 'theft' a Klal. From a Prat u'Chlal we learn everything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Tana means 'had the Torah written only 'theft... ox...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why would we think that all is included?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Theft' would be a Klal, and 'ox' would be a Prat. From a Klal u'Frat we learn only the Prat, an ox!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Tana relies on 'living', a second Klal. There is a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The second Klal (includes only living things. This) is unlike the first Klal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael, who expounds such a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal. The Tana asks as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need "Im Himatzei Simatzei?" We could learn everything from (the Klal u'Frat u'Chlal) 'ox, theft, living'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the only Prat was 'ox', we would include only animals that are offered on the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This would include a Seh. However, the Torah explicitly wrote "Seh"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, we must say that "theft..." comes to include everything (through the method of Klalim and Peratim);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> It would have sufficed to write 'theft, ox, Seh, living'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, we would have included only animals whose firstborn have Kedushah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That would include a donkey. However, the Torah explicitly wrote "donkey"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We must say that "theft..." includes everything. It would have sufficed to write 'theft, ox, Seh, donkey, living'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, we would include only living things.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah explicitly writes "living" (which includes all living things)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We must say that "theft..." includes everything. Why did the Torah need to write "Im Himatzei Simatzei"?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">64b----------------------------------------64b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If this was the question, how can we answer it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We asserted that we could have included everything from 'theft, ox, Seh, donkey, living.' This is wrong. We cannot include more than the latter Klal, which is "living"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from the Klal u'Frat u'Chlal?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We cannot learn everything, for the latter Klal is "living", which can include only living things!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of answer):</span> This is why we need "Im Himatzei Simatzei" (to include everything).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ADJACENT <i>KELALIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Peratim are not between the Klalim "Himatzei" and "Simatzei"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> In such a case, we consider it as if the Peratim were in the middle, to expound like a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We put "ox" between "Himatzei" and "Simatzei". What does this include?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It need not include living things. We already know this from "living"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it includes inanimate things.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">We expound:</span> the Prat is movable and has intrinsic value. We include all such things.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We put "donkey" between "Himatzei" and "Simatzei." What does this include?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It need not include inanimate things. We already know them from "ox"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it includes specific things (Rashi - that have Simanim; Tosfos - they have a measure, or are whole).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, what do we learn from "Seh"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, we expound it through Ribuyim and Mi'utim, like Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> We do not expound "in water... in water" through the method of Klalim and Peratim. Rather, it is a Ribuy u'Mi'ut u'Ribuy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is a Ribuy u'Mi'ut u'Ribuy, everything is included. Why were the Peratim written?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One excludes land, one excludes slaves, and one excludes documents;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Theft" and "living" teach like Rav, that the thief must resuscitate what he stole (restore it to the value at the time he stole it).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT DO WE LEARN FROM <i>IM</i> <i>HIMATZEI</i> <i>SIMATZEI</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Beraisa #2 (one verse discusses a thief, and the other discusses one who claims that the deposit was stolen), what do we learn from "Im Himatzei Simatzei"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches Rava bar Ahilai's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava bar Ahilai citing Rav):</span> If \is this how you want?\one admits to a fine, and witnesses came later, he is exempt. He learns from "Im Himatzei Simatzei";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Himatzei (he will be found) through witnesses, judges Simatzei (will find him) liable. This excludes one who incriminates himself (even if witnesses come later).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Beraisa #1 (both verses discuss one who claims that the deposit was stolen), from where do we know this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Whom the judges will convict" excludes one who incriminates himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the Tana of Beraisa #2 learn from this verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It exempts one who admits to a fine. (This allows him to learn from "Im Himatzei..." that even if witnesses come later, he is exempt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana of Beraisa #1 only has one verse exempting one who admits to a fine. He holds that if witnesses come later, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Beraisa #2, we said that "Im Himatzei Simatzei" teaches like Rava bar Ahilai. What do the Peratim teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> An entire Parshah can be repeated for the one Chidush. (Here, Im Himatzei Simatzei exempts one who admits to a fine. We did not need the Peratim, for we can learn from the coming Parshah (Im Lo Yimatzei ha'Ganav, which discusses one who claims that it was stolen, and also lists the Peratim).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> An actual thief should pay Kefel only if he swore!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Yakov):</span> "He will pay Kefel" - without an oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is only if he swore!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It was not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Torah did not need to write that a thief pays Kefel. We could have learned from a Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One who (falsely) claims that the deposit was stolen pays Kefel, even though the object came to him in a permitted way. A thief took the object in a forbidden way, all the more so he pays Kefel!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The Torah write that a thief "pays two" to teach that this is even if he did not swear.</p>
