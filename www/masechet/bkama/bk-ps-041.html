<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CASES IN WHICH <i>KOFER</i> IS PAID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Really, it killed through Bi'ah. This is unlike goring. A gorer intends to kill. This animal intended for its own benefit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Abaye and Rava argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about an ox that trampled a baby in the victim's premises.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye holds that it pays Kofer. Rava holds that (the Tana of the Beraisa says) it does not (because it did not intend to kill).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav - Beraisa):</span> An Itztadin ox is not killed, and it is acceptable for a Korban, because it is as if it was forced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an ox gored and killed a man, if it was Mu'ad, it pays Kofer. If it was Tam, it is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In either case, the ox is killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The same applies to killing a boy or girl.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If it killed a slave, it pays 30 Shekalim, even if the slave is worth much more or much less.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW CAN AN ANIMAL BECOME A MU'AD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Since we kill even a Tam, how can it become Mu'ad?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> The case is, it chased three people. We estimate that had they not fled, it would have killed all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> Our estimation has no bearing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, it gored three people, making them dangerously sick (and they died later).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Zvid):</span> It killed three animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must we say that Mu'ad for animals is Mu'ad for people?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Simi):</span> It killed three Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must we say that Mu'ad for Nochrim is Mu'ad for Yisraelim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Reish Lakish):</span> It killed three people who were Tereifos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must we say that Mu'ad for Tereifos is Mu'ad for healthy people?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Rav Papa):</span> Each time it killed, it fled and we were unable to kill it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #7 (R. Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> Reuven and David testified about the first goring, and were Huzmu (Moshe and Kalev (the Mazimim) testified that Reuven and David were not where they claimed to see the goring). Also the witnesses about the second goring were Huzmu;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After witnesses testified about the third goring, (the Mazimim were Huzmu, so) we realized that the witnesses about the first two gorings really told the truth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that the testimony is to establish the ox like a gorer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But according to the opinion that it is to warn the owner to guard his animal, he thought that the first witnesses lied (he was not warned until now)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, (witnesses testify that) the owner saw all the gorings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #8 (Ravina):</span> The witnesses recognized the ox' owner, but did not recognize the ox (until after all the gorings).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should the owner pay Kofer? What should he have done?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should have guarded all his oxen.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DERIVING BENEFIT FROM AN OX THAT MUST BE STONED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> Since "you will stone the ox", it will be a Neveilah (an animal that died without slaughter). Why did the Torah need to written "its flesh will not be eaten"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that even if it was slaughtered, it may not be eaten.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one may not benefit from it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "The owner of the ox is clean".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shimon ben Zoma):</span> This is like people say, 'Ploni is clean of his property, and has no benefit from it'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that "its flesh will not be eaten" applies when it was slaughtered? Perhaps it forbids benefit when it was stoned, like R. Avahu taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Wherever the Torah said "it will not be eaten" or "you will not eat", it forbids even benefit, unless the Torah explicitly permits benefit, like regarding Neveilah (it permits giving it to a non-Yisrael who keeps his seven Mitzvos, or selling it to a Nochri).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Avahu's law applies only when "it will not be eaten" forbids eating it. Here, we already know that one may not eat it because it must be stoned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the verse came to forbid benefit, it should have said 'one will not benefit';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Alternatively, it could have said (only) 'it will not be eaten';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It adds 'its flesh' to teach that even if it was slaughtered like meat, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra):</span> Perhaps that is only when it was slaughtered with a sharp stone, which is like stoning, but if it was slaughtered with a knife, it is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah does not require a knife for slaughter. (There is no reason why this should be more permitted than through a stone.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughters with a pruning hook, stone or reed, it is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since "its flesh will not be eaten" forbids benefit from it, what do we learn from "the owner of the ox is clean"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It forbids benefit from the skin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that benefit if forbidden only from the meat. The verse teaches that even the skin is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Other Tana'im (in Beraisos below) expound "the owner of the ox is clean" differently. How do they learn that one may not benefit from the skin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Es Besaro" discusses what is secondary to its flesh, i.e. the skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Our Tana does not expound "Es".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Shimon ha'Amsoni used to expound every 'Es' in the Torah (to include something). When he came to "you will fear Es Hash-m", he found nothing to include.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> If so, perhaps also the other occurrences of 'Es' should not be expounded!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> Indeed, I retract them all! Just like I will receive reward for what I expounded (at the time, I believed that it was true), I will be rewarded for refusing to expound.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> "You will fear Es Hash-m" includes Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHY A <i>TAM</i> DOES NOT PAY <i>KOFER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Eliezer):</span> "The owner of the ox is clean" from paying half-Kofer;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Akiva):</span> A Tam only pays from itself. Since we may not benefit from the damager, obviously it does not pay Kofer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> I did not discuss when we stone it. Rather, we know that it killed through one witness or the owner's admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he admitted, surely he is exempt from Kofer, like anyone who admits to a fine!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer holds that Kofer is an atonement (therefore, it is paid even through one witness or his admission).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Eliezer):</span> I did not discuss when we stone it, rather when it killed without intent for a Yisrael (but rather for an animal, Nochri or stillborn baby).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which of these two answers did R. Eliezer give first?</p>
