<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ACQUISITION THROUGH DESPAIR (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Rava explained (elsewhere), because he repeated his (intent to) sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "He will slaughter or sell it" - just like slaughter is irreversible, also the sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it was before despair, why is the sale irreversible?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it was after despair.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> If despair acquires, why does he pay four and five? He slaughters or sells his own animal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa said that the sale is irreversible like Rav Nachman explained (elsewhere), to exclude a case when he only sold it for 30 days. (However, one is liable before despair, even though the sale is invalid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven stole an animal, and Shimon stole it from him, Reuven pays the (extra payment of) Kefel, and Shimon only pays principal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven stole an animal and sold it, then Shimon stole it, Reuven pays four and five, and Shimon pays Kefel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven stole an animal and slaughtered it, then Shimon stole it, Reuven pays four and five, and Shimon pays only principal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> In the middle case (Reuven stole and sold, then Shimon stole). When did Reuven sell?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it was before despair, why does Shimon pay Kefel? All agree that one who buys from Reuven does not acquire through a mere change of domain, without despair!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it was after despair.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> If despair acquires, why does he pay four and five? He slaughters or sells his own animal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> In the Reisha (Reuven stole and sold, then Shimon stole, and we established that the Beraisa is after despair), if a thief acquires through despair, why doesn't Shimon pay Kefel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rava):</span> There is a mistake in the Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Seifa says that if Reuven stole an animal and slaughtered it, then Shimon stole it, Reuven pays four and five, and Shimon pays only principal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All agree that one acquires through a change. Shimon should pay Kefel (to Reuven)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to Questions (g) and (h) - Rava):</span> Rather, the Beraisa discusses before despair. The laws of the last two cases must be switched. They say as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven stole an animal and sold it, then Shimon stole it, Reuven pays four and five, and Shimon only pays principal, because a change in domain without despair does not acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven stole an animal and slaughtered it, then Shimon stole it, Reuven pays four and five, and Shimon pays Kefel, because Reuven acquired through change.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (h) - Rav Papa):</span> We need not switch the cases. The Seifa is like Beis Shamai, who say that one does not acquire through a change.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the first two clauses contradict Rav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Zvid):</span> In the entire Beraisa, Reuven slaughtered or sold before despair. The case is, the owner despaired when the buyer had it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not because despair acquires only together with a change of domain. Really, despair acquires by itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Beraisa discusses when he despaired when the buyer had it, for this is the only way in which the first thief pays four and five, and the latter pays Kefel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SELLING BEFORE DESPAIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If a thief sold before despair, he is liable (four and five);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> He is exempt (and pays only Kefel).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nachman learns from "and will sell it" - whether before or after despair;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Sheshes says, he is liable only when the sale is valid, i.e. after despair;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is like the liability for slaughter, in which his action accomplished something.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Sheshes, for himself - Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> The Torah said that one who slaughters or sells pays four and five, because he entrenched himself in sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When did he slaughter or sell?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it was before despair, (regarding selling), he did not go deeper in sin (the sale does nothing)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it was after despair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Really, it was before despair. He is punished for repeating his (intent to) sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "He will slaughter or sell it" - just like slaughter is irreversible, also the sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it was before despair, why is the sale irreversible?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it was after despair. This shows that one is liable only after despair!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The Beraisa said that the sale is irreversible to exclude a case when he only sold it for 30 days. (However, one is liable before despair, even though the sale is invalid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Also R. Elazar says that if he sells before despair, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">68b----------------------------------------68b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> We can prove that people are assumed to despair when something is covertly stolen, from the obligation to pay four and five.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If we could not assume that he despaired, why would he be liable for selling?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he is liable even if there was no despair!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It must be like slaughter, which accomplishes something. This is only after despair.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he pays four and five only when we heard that the owner despaired, but normally, we do not assume there was despair!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is like slaughter, for which he is liable immediately (even before we hear that the owner despaired).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We can learn from kidnapping. One is liable without despair (the victim does not despair from escaping)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Yochanan holds that one is liable (four and five) before despair.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SELLING BEFORE DESPAIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is one liable also after despair?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> No. The thief acquires it, he slaughters or sells his own animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> If one stole an animal and made it Hekdesh and then slaughtered it, he pays Kefel, but not four and five.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is before despair, it does not become Hekdesh! "A man who will make his house Hekdesh" - one can make only his own things Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is after despair. He is exempt only because he made it Hekdesh, and he slaughtered a Hekdesh animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had he not made it Hekdesh, he would be liable. We do not say that he slaughters or sells his own animal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> The case is, the owner made it Hekdesh in the thief's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It would not become Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If something was stolen, and the owner did not despair, neither the thief nor owner can make it Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The thief cannot, for it is not his. The owner cannot, for it is in his Reshus (under his control)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish holds like Tzenu'im (the pious ones, who were concerned lest people taking Shemitah produce (or stealing) from the Tzenu'im's fields unknowingly take Reva'i (fruits of a tree in its fourth year, which must be eaten in Yerushalayim or redeemed));</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Tzenu'im would take coins and say 'whatever (Reva'i) was gathered from my field is redeemed on these coins.' (Even though it is not in their Reshus, they can redeem it. Likewise, one can be Makdish something not in his Reshus!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the owner made it Hekdesh, he got his animal back. Why does the thief pay Kefel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he was Makdish it after the trial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the judges told him 'go give to him', even if he didn't make it Hekdesh, he would be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If the judges told him 'go give to him' and he slaughtered or sold, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once the case was settled, he is like an open robber, who does not pay four and five.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If the judges told him 'you are obligated to give him' and he slaughtered or sold, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since they did not yet say to carry out the verdict, he is like a thief, who pays four and five.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the judges told him 'go give him.'</p>
