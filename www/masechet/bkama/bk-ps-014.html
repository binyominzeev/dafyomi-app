<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LIABILITY IN JOINT PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If the wall broke down at night, or robbers made an opening and the animal went out and damaged, the Shomer is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> Had the wall broken down during the day, he would be liable. 2.  If he did not accept to guard it from damaging, he should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa teaches that if the Shomer accepted to guard the animal from damaging, he is liable. If the wall broke down at night, or robbers made an opening and the animal went out and damaged, the Shomer is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> One is liable for Shen and Regel in joint property or an inn!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refutes R. Elazar (who exempts for Shen and Regel there - 13b)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> There are four general rules in damages:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In the property of (only) the victim, one is liable for everything;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>In the property of (only) the damager, one is exempt for everything;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>In the property of the victim and damager, such like a joint yard or a valley, one is exempt for Shen and Regel, and liable for Keren and its Toldos. A Tam pays half-damage, and a Mu'ad pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>In property not of the victim and damager, such a yard that is not of both of them or a valley, one is liable for Shen and Regel. For Keren and its Toldos, a Tam pays half-damage, and a Mu'ad pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Beraisa #2 exempts for Shen and Regel in a joint yard or a valley. Beraisa #1 obligates for these! 3.  Answer: In Beraisa #2, the case is, they both have rights to use the yard for fruit and animals;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In Beraisa #1, they may use it only for Peros. Regarding Shen, it is like the victim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Presumably, the joint yard is like the case it is taught with. In Beraisa #1, it is like an inn (where people do not bring animals). In Beraisa #2, it is like a valley (where people bring animals).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If both may put Peros in the yard, this is not considered "it consumed in another's field"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Since he may not bring animals there, it is considered another's field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Acha mi'Difti):</span> Just like the Tana'im don't argue, perhaps also the Amora'im don't argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> This is correct!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Alternatively, we can say that they argue. R. Elazar holds like R. Zeira (if the damager can bring fruit there, it is not called another's field), and Rav Chisda holds like Abaye.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FOUR GENERAL RULES ABOUT PAYMENT FOR DAMAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> There are four general rules in damages. In the property of (only) the victim, one is liable in all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It says in all, not for all. This implies that it pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like R. Tarfon, who says that Keren pays full damage in the victim's Reshus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> In Reshus not of the victim and damager, such a yard that is not of both of them, or a valley, one is liable for Shen and Regel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'Reshus not of the victim and damager' mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It belongs to someone else.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Torah obligates only when "it consumed in another's field", i.e. the Peros of the field's owner!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is not of both of them, only of one (the victim). The Mishnah continues, for Keren and its Toldos, a Tam pays half-damage, and a Mu'ad pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is like Chachamim, who say that Keren pays half-damage in the premises of the victim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> Can the Reisha be like R. Tarfon, and the end as Chachamim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> The entire Beraisa is like R. Tarfon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Seifa says, it is 'Reshus not of the victim and damager' (rather, only of the victim) regarding Peros;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Both are allowed to bring their animals in.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding Shen, it is the Reshus of the victim. Regarding Keren, it is like a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, R. Shimon ben Elazar only gave three general rules, not four (since the last rule is already known from the previous rules)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> He gives three rules in four places.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WE EVALUATE THE DAMAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An evaluation of money, Shavah Kesef, in front of Beis Din, and according to witnesses (the entire Mishnah will be explained below);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Free men, members of the covenant, and women are included in damages;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The victim and damager are involved in payments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does 'an evaluation of money' refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The evaluation (of damage) is made in money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Our Mishnah teaches like the following Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a cow damaged a cloak or was damaged by it, we do not say that the victim receives the damager. Rather, we evaluate the damage. (Tosfos, and Rashi according to the Bach.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CONDITIONS TO PAY DAMAGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shavah Kesef.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> 'Shavah Kesef' teaches that Beis Din collects only if the damager has land (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the victim seized Metaltelim, Beis Din collects the damages from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does 'Shavah Kesef' teach that Beis Din collects only if the damager has land?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar Ula):</span> It is something Shavah (worth) all the money you pay for it, i.e. there is no law of Ona'ah (returning what one overcharged). This refers to land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Ona'ah does not apply to slaves and documents, either!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar Ula):</span> Rather, it is something that can be acquired through money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also slaves and documents can be acquired through money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> It is Shavah Kesef, but not money itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Everything except land is considered money, for it can be taken elsewhere and sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah bar Chinena):</span> Our Mishnah teaches 'Shavah Kesef', i.e. Beis Din collects only if the damager has land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> "He will return" teaches that (anything) worth money may be given, even bran.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> We collect from orphans only if they inherited land. (From the damager himself, we collect from anything.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If the victim seized Metaltelim, Beis Din collects the damages from them. 1.  If he seized from orphans, why does he collect?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We answer like Rava said (elsewhere). The case is, he seized Metaltelim in the life of the damager.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In front of Beis Din...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>This excludes one who sold his property before going to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May we infer that if a borrower sold his property before going to Beis Din, Beis Din will not collect from the sold property?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the Mishnah teaches that only a Beis Din of experts may judge damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> According to witnesses...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>This excludes one who admits to a fine, and witnesses came later. Such a person is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that if one admits to a fine, and later witnesses come, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that one is liable in this case, what does the Mishnah teach?</p>
