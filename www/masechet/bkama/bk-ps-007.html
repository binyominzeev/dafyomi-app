<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is like a debt. Debts are collected from Beinonis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Akiva holds that debts are collected from Idis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A (human) creditor is paid when his ox is gored. We cannot learn to Hekdesh, which is not paid when its ox is gored!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, a man's ox gored a Hekdesh ox. Akiva expounds "the ox of his fellowman" like R. Shimon ben Menasya;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Menasya):</span> If a Hekdesh ox gores a man's ox, Hekdesh does not pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a man's ox (whether Tam or Mu'ad) gores a Hekdesh ox, he pays full damage. (Half-damage applies only to "the ox of his fellowman.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is the source that R. Yishmael and R. Akiva argue when the damager's Ziburis is like the victim's Idis?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps they agree that one pays like the Idis of the victim. They argue only about R. Shimon ben Menasya's law!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If so, R. Akiva should not say 'the verse comes only' (since he agrees about damages)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If so, the Kal va'Chomer to Hekdesh is inaccurate (for Hekdesh's Idis is surely better than the damager's)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi - Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "From the best of his field and vineyard he will pay" - from land equal to the best land of the victim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva says, from the best land of the damager.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PAYMENT UNLIKE THE TORAH SPECIFIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> "From the best of his field and vineyard he will pay" teaches that only Idis may be paid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #1):</span> "He will return" teaches that Shavah Kesef (something worth money) may be given, even bran.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> If the damager pays willingly, and does not force the victim to take him to Beis Din, he may pay even bran. If the damager was unwilling to pay, and the victim had to get Beis Din to force him to pay, he pays only money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Ula brei d'Rav Ilai):</span> "He will pay" - against the will of the damager.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> It doesn't say "he will be forced to pay", but rather "he will pay", which just as easily implies that he agrees to pay on his own!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The resolution is like Rabah taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> (One who has 200 Zuz is considered rich, and cannot take gifts for the poor.) If Reuven has houses, fields and vineyards (worth 200 Zuz), but cannot sell them, he may take Ma'aser Oni, up to half (100 Zuz).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the value of everyone's land declined, Reuven may receive even more (he is like any poor person, who may receive at once a gift of any size)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Other people's land did not decline. Reuven's land declined, because people know that he must sell.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he may not receive any (Rif's text - he may receive even more) gifts of the poor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> Rather, (in Reuven's area), land is worth more in Nisan, and less in Tishrei.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Everyone else waits until Nisan to sell. Reuven cannot wait, and he must sell now.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The seasonal cheapening of land is never worse than half the value. (Land worth 200 in Nisan is worth at least 100 in Tishrei.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(Culmination of Abaye's answer):</span> The same applies to damages. They should be paid with Idis, at the current price;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the victim demands a larger quantity of Beinonis (Beraisa #2 calls this Shavah Kesef), the damager can stipulate that he receive it at the higher price of Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Acha bar Yakov):</span> If so, the victim has the lower hand if he wants to collect Beinonis or Ziburis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah entitled him to Idis. You cannot say that he has no right to demand Beinonis or Ziburis (without suffering a loss)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Acha bar Yakov):</span> The proper comparison to Rabah's law is regarding a creditor (to whom the Torah did not give the greatest privileges of collection)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A loan should be paid from Beinonis (at the current price);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the creditor requests a larger quantity of Ziburis, the borrower can stipulate that he receive it at the higher price of Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> If that is the law, people will refrain from lending!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Creditors will complain 'had I not lent my money, I could have bought land at today's cheap price. Because I lent my money, must I now receive land at the higher price of Nisan?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> The proper comparison to Rabah's law is regarding a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Kesuvah should be paid from Ziburis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she requests a smaller quantity of Beinonis, the husband (or orphans) can stipulate that she receive it at the higher price of Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PAYMENT WITH <i>IDIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The contradiction has not been resolved! ("From the best of his field" connotes only Idis. A Beraisa learned from "he will return" that one may give Shavah Kesef.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Whatever the damager gives (land or any kind of Metaltelim) must be Meitav (highest quality).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says "from the best of his field"! (He need not give Meitav from Metaltelim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Papa):</span> All Metaltelim are considered Meitav. If they can't be sold here, they can be sold elsewhere;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Land cannot be sold elsewhere. Therefore, one who pays with land must give Idis, so it will be easy to sell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shmuel bar Aba of Akronya):</span> Does the determination of what is considered Idis depend on this person's property, or the world standard?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Yishmael, one pays the Idis of the victim. Clearly, it depends on his property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The question is according to R. Akiva:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Does "the best of his (the damager's) field" exclude the Idis of the victim (but it suffices to give Idis of the world standard)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, does "the best of his field" teach that he must give his own best?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> "From the best of his field" clearly means his own best!</p>
