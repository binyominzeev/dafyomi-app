<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FOR WHICH ITEMS DOES A THIEF PAY DOUBLE? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If so, the Torah should have written only one Prat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which one should it have written?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it written only "ox (or Seh)", one might have thought that we include only animals that are offered on the Mizbe'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it written only "donkey", one might have thought that we only include animals for which the firstborn has Kedushah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Torah should have written only "ox and donkey." "Seh" is extra to include birds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should include only Tahor birds. They are more similar to a Seh, for their carcasses are Metamei (and even make Tamei the clothes of one who eats them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tamei birds do not impart Tum'ah at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "All" is a Ribuy (inclusion. We do not expound it according to Klal u'Frat u'Chlal. Rather, it includes all birds.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not always expound 'all' like a Ribuy!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says 'all' regarding Ma'aser, but we expound according to Klal u'Frat u'Chlal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "You will spend the money on whatever your soul desires" is a Klal. "On cattle, flock, wine and strong drink" are Peratim. "And on all that your soul requests" is another  Klal;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>From a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal we learn everything that is like the Prat, (in this case) whatever reproduces and grows from the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> 'B'Chol (on all)' is a Klal. 'Kol (all)' is a Ribuy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Normally, 'all' is a Klal. Here, it is a Ribuy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There already was a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal. "If a man will give to his fellow man" is a Klal. "Money or Kelim" are Peratim. "To guard" is another Klal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had the Torah intended that "for any transgression" also be expound like a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal, it would have written the Peratim with the other Klalim ("when a man will give" and "to guard")!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, the Torah intended that "for any transgression" be expounded through Ribuyim (and Mi'utim (exclusions)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what do the Peratim teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One excludes land, one excludes slaves, one excludes documents, and "garment" excludes something not specific (Rashi - it has no Simanim (ways to identify it; Tosfos - it has no measure, or half of something);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"For any Aveidah" teaches like R. Chiya bar Aba.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If one who found a lost object (falsely) claimed that later it was stolen from him, he pays Kefel - "for any Aveidah that he will say".</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A CLAIM THAT THE ITEM WAS LOST OR STOLEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon claimed that the item Reuven deposited with him was lost, and Reuven imposed an oath on him, and he answered "Amen", and witnesses testify that Shimon ate it, he pays the value;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he admits by himself, he pays the value, Chomesh (an added fifth, i.e. a fourth of the principal), and brings a Korban Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Shimon claimed that the item was stolen, and answered "Amen" to the oath, and witnesses testify that Shimon ate it, he pays Kefel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he admits by himself, he pays the value, a Chomesh, and brings an Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Kefel applies only to one who claims that it was stolen, but not to one who claims that it was lost;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even one who claims that it was stolen pays Kefel only if he swore!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of these laws?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa #1):</span> "Im Yimatzei ha'Ganav (if the thief will be found)" discusses one who claims that it was stolen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it discusses an actual thief!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Im Lo Yimatzei" discusses one who claims that it was stolen, so also Im Yimatzei discusses one who claims that it was stolen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa #2):</span> "Im Yimatzei ha'Ganav" discusses an actual thief.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it discusses one who claims that it was stolen!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Im Lo Yimatzei" discusses one who claims that it was stolen, so Im Yimatzei discusses one who claims that it was stolen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Both Beraisos agree that "Im Lo ha'Ganav" discusses one who claims that it was stolen. How do we know this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Im Lo Yimatzei ha'Ganav" - it will not be found like he says, rather, he stole it, "he will pay Kefel."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of that he pays only if he swore?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "The (Shomer) will draw close to the judges" - to swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he draws close for judgment, not to swear!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It mentions unauthorized use here (regarding a Shomer Chinam) and later (regarding a Shomer Sachar). Just like later he swears, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, (the) Tana (of Beraisa) #2 holds that one verse discusses an actual thief, and one discusses a Shomer who claims that it was stolen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Tana #1, why do two verses both discuss a Shomer who claims that it was stolen?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is needed to exclude a Shomer who claims that it was lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Tana #2 learn this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "the thief" ('the' excludes a claim that it was lost).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Tana #1 learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns R. Chiya bar Aba's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If a Shomer (falsely) claimed that the item was stolen, he pays Kefel. If he slaughtered or sold it, he pays four and five.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Tana #2's source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah writes the law of an actual thief adjacent to the law of one who claims that the item was stolen. This equates their laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand Tana #2. (He holds that one verse discusses an actual thief, and teaches that an actual thief pays Kefel, and four and five.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tana #1 holds that neither verse discusses an actual thief. What is his source that an actual thief pays Kefel, four and five?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He learns from a Kal va'Chomer. One who claims that the item was stolen pays Kefel, four and five, all the more so, an actual thief pays them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The principal of Dayo (a Kal va'Chomer cannot teach more than the source) allows us to learn only in the same situation, i.e. after swearing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns like Tana d'Vei Chizkiyah (below).</p>
