<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MUST THE <i>SHOMER</i> PARTIALLY DENY THE CLAIM? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Yosef):</span> This verse does not apply to the Parshah in which it was written (Shomrim), rather elsewhere, by loans.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should the oath about loans apply to only when there was partial admission, the oath of Shomrim always applies?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Rabah taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> The Torah obligates a borrower to swear (when he partially admits to the claim) because it is human nature that a borrower is not brazen enough to (fully) deny the lender's claim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If not for this, he would deny the entire claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Because borrowers are not brazen, he would like to admit to the full claim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He denied part of it to stall until he has the money to pay the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Torah imposed the oath on him, in order that he will admit to the full claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A Shomer is brazen enough to deny the claim, so he swears even by full denial.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">107b----------------------------------------107b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Yechezkel):</span> The four types of Shomrim, a Shomer Chinam, borrower, Shomer Sachar or renter, swear only when there is partial denial and partial admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He learns about a Shomer Chinam from "Ki Hu Zeh", which is written in the Parshah of Shomer Chinam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He learns about a Shomer Sachar from a Gezeirah Shavah "Nesinah-Nesinah" from a Shomer Chinam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding a borrower it says "v'Chi (and when) one will borrow" - the 'Vav' equates this law to the previous Parshah (a Shomer Sachar);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Tana'im argue about whether a renter is like a Shomer Chinam or a Shomer Sachar;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In either case, we learned that he swears only if there was partial admission.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TAKING A DEPOSIT FOR ONE'S OWN USE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Yosef):</span> One who claims that a deposit was stolen pays Kefel only if he was Shole'ach Yad (took it for his own needs).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "The Shomer will come to the judges, (to swear) that he was not Shole'ach Yad... (For any negligence, he pays Kefel)" implies that if he did take it, he pays Kefel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This (Kefel) is only if he was Shole'ach Yad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> The case is, the deposited animal is at the feeding trough (he did not take it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Does R. Yochanan teach that had he been Shole'ach Yad, he would be a Gazlan (not a Ganav), therefore he would not pay Kefel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, does he teach that even if it is at the feeding trough, if he (falsely) claims that it was stolen, he pays Kefel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Aba:</span> I did not hear about this, but I heard a similar case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> If a Shomer (claimed and) swore that the deposit was lost, then he swore that it was stolen, and witnesses later testified that he had it, he does not pay Kefel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is because he acquired the deposit through his first oath (and owes only principal. From then, it is considered his object, so he cannot pay Kefel for it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Rather, once he swore (that it was lost), he is not obligated to swear again, so the second oath is not like a Shomer's oath to obligate Kefel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (R. Avin citing R. Yochanan):</span> If a Shomer swore that the deposit was lost, then he swore that it was stolen, and witnesses later testified that he had it, he does not pay Kefel, because he was obligated to swear only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> If one claims that a deposit was stolen, and he took it (before he swore), he is exempt (from Kefel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "The (Shomer) will come to the judges, if he did not Shole'ach Yad in his fellowman's object" implies that if he did take it, he is exempt (from Kefel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> He must make three oaths: that he was not negligent, that he was not Shole'ach Yad, and that it is not in his domain!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The oath that he was not Shole'ach Yad is like the oath that it is not in his domain. Just like regarding the oath that it is not in his domain, if it is found that he swore falsely, he pays Kefel (for really, he stole it) - also, regarding the oath that he was not Shole'ach Yad!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> No, the oath that he was not Shole'ach Yad is like the oath that he was not negligent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like if he swore falsely that he was not negligent, he (is like a Gazlan, who) does not pay Kefel, also regarding the oath that he was not Shole'ach Yad!</p>
