<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A REVERSIBLE CHANGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It is still called a beam, even after it is built into the roof.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Tzal'os of the (future Mikdash)" are the boards that hold the rafters in place. "Ha'Ovim" are the beams.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 3:a, 66b - R. Zeira):</span> A change in name that can be reversed is not considered a change.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A change of name that cannot be reversed is a change!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A pipe was called a piece of wood before it was hollowed out (and even after it is a pipe, it is as if did not change)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a pipe was hollowed out and then affixed (for water to flow through it into a Mikvah, it is considered a Kli. Water that goes through it is called 'She'uvim', and) it disqualifies the Mikvah (if the Mikvah did not yet have 40 Sa'im of water). If it was affixed and then hollowed out, it does not disqualify the Mikvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The law that Mayim She'uvim disqualifies a Mikvah is mid'Rabanan. (Chachamim were lenient about it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even when it was hollowed out first, they should be lenient!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, it was a Kli before it was attached.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Ganav, Gazlan or Chamsan extortionist made something Hekdesh, Terumah or Ma'aser, it takes effect. (This shows that one acquires through despair!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he acquires due to the change in name from Tevel to Terumah (or Ma'aser), or from Chulin to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES CHANGE ACQUIRE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> We learn that Shinuy Koneh from "he will return the stolen item that he stole." - the extra words teach, he returns it only if it is like what he stole. If not, he returns the value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need that verse to teach that one does not add a Chomesh for stealing from one's father (and swearing to deny it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah could have written 'he will return his stolen object' to teach that. "That he stole" is extra, to teach also that Shinuy Koneh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> We learn that Ein Shinuy Koneh from "he will return the stolen item" - in any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "that he stole"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches that one does not add a Chomesh for stealing from one's father. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> We learn that Ein Shinuy Koneh from "and you will offer (an animal that is) stolen, lame or sick." This equates a stolen animal to a lame one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a lame animal cannot become acceptable, also a stolen animal, even after the owner despairs!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">67b----------------------------------------67b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We learn from "his Korban" - not a stolen one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When does this apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is before despair, this is obvious. No verse would be needed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is after despair. This teaches that despair does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Earlier, Rava answered that the thief stole a Korban. (We can say so also here, so the verse is no proof!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rava retracted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> One of these Rav Papa said, not Rava.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FOUR AND FIVE APPLIES ONLY TO AN OX OR <i>SEH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The payment of four and five (applies only to an ox or Seh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn from Shabbos, about which it says "ox", and it even applies to wild animals and birds?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It says "ox" and "Seh" twice. The repetition teaches that this is only for an ox or Seh, but nothing else.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which are extra?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The latter are extra. It could have written 'if a man will steal an ox or Seh and slaughter it or sell it, he will pay five cattle Tachtav (in place of it), and four flock Tachtav.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, one might have thought that he pays nine animals for either!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One 'Tachtav' is extra, to show that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The extra 'Tachtav' teaches a different law!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one who stole an expensive ox may pay dying oxen in place of it!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Tachas" (they must correspond to it. "Tachas" written regarding flock teaches the same about flock).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The first "ox" and "Seh" are extra. It could have written 'if a man will steal and slaughter it or sell it, he will pay five cattle in place of the ox, and four flock in place of the Seh.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, one might have thought that he pays only when he steals and slaughters an ox and a Seh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Slaughter it', teaches that that is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One might have thought that he must steal both, and slaughter one and sell the other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Slaughter it or sell it' shows that that is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> One might have thought that he must steal both, slaughter or sell one, and keep the other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The latter "ox" and the first "Seh" are extra. It could have written 'if a man will steal an ox and slaughter it or sell it, he will pay five cattle in place of it, and four flock in place of the Seh';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From the extra "ox" at the end of the verse, and the extra "Seh" at the beginning, we hear, four and five applies only to cattle and flock.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ACQUISITION THROUGH DESPAIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A thief who steals from a thief does not pay Kefel...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This is only before despair (of the owner). After despair, the first thief acquires it, and the second thief pays Kefel to the first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> The Torah said that one who slaughters or sells pays four and five, because he entrenched himself in sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When did he slaughter or sell?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it was before despair, he (one who sold) did not go deeper in sin (the sale does nothing)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it was after despair.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> If despair acquires, why does he pay four and five? He slaughters or sells his own animal!</p>
