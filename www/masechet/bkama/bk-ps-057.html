<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WATCHING AN <i>AVEIDAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> One watching an a Aveidah (lost object) is considered a Shomer Chinam (he is exempt if he loses it or it is stolen);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> He is like a Shomer Sachar (he is liable for loss or theft).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah says that he is like a Shomer Chinam, for he gets no benefit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rav Yosef says that he is like a Shomer Sachar, for it is a Mitzvah to watch an Aveidah. This Mitzvah exempts him from giving bread to a poor man who requests.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rav Yosef says, since the Torah obligated him to watch the Aveidah, he is like a Shomer Sachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> If the finder returned the Aveidah to a place where the owner can see it, this is enough. If it was stolen or lost, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It was stolen or lost from the finder's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> No, it was stolen or lost from the place to which he returned it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that if he returned it to there, this is enough!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he returned it in the afternoon. The Beraisa teaches two laws:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he returned it in the morning to a place where the owner normally goes and can see it, this is enough;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he returned it in the afternoon to a place where it can be seen, but the owner doesn't normally go there [at that time of day], and it was stolen or lost, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> He is always liable until he returns it to his premises.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is liable even (if it was stolen or lost) from the finder's house. This shows that he is a Shomer Sachar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah admits that one who finds an animal is liable. Since the animal learned to roam, it must be watched better (so he was negligent. Perhaps he is exempt for theft (Tosfos).).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah - Beraisa):</span> "Return" - to his house. "You will return them" - even to his garden or (deserted) ruin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of returning to his garden or ruin?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they are guarded, this is just like returning to his house!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, they are not guarded. This shows that the finder is like a Shomer Chinam (even a minimal guarding suffices)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question i:1 - Rav Yosef):</span> Really, they are guarded. The Beraisa teaches that the owner need not know that they were returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> In all cases, the owner must know when his article was returned, except for an Aveidah, for the Torah mentioned "returning" it many times.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO CLAIMS THAT THE ITEM WAS STOLEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Yosef - Abaye):</span> R. Chiya bar Aba cited R. Yochanan to say that if Levi found an Aveidah and swore that it was stolen from him (and later, it was found that Levi had it), he pays Kefel (double), like a thief.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a finder is a Shomer Sachar, when he claims that it was stolen, he must pay! (Since Levi was not trying to steal (he obligated himself), he would not pay Kefel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The case is, he claimed that armed robbers stole it. (He exempted himself, for this is Ones.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Armed robbers never pay Kefel, only thieves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Since they hide from people, they are like thieves, and they pay Kefel.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">57b----------------------------------------57b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> You cannot learn from a Shomer Chinam, who pays Kefel, to a Shomer Sachar, who does not pay Kefel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If armed robbers were like thieves and paid Kefel, also a Shomer Chinam would pay Kefel (when he claims that armed robbers took it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The Beraisa means 'you cannot learn from a Shomer Chinam, who pays Kefel for any (false) claim (of theft), to a Shomer Sachar, who pays Kefel only regarding a claim of armed robbers.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa) Question:</span> "(A borrower is liable) if it was broken or died." What is the source (that he is liable) even if it was stolen or lost?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches this. A Shomer Sachar is exempt when it is broken or dies, but is liable for theft or loss. A borrower is liable when it is broken or dies. All the more so he is liable for theft or loss! This Kal va'Chomer cannot be challenged.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If armed robbers are like thieves and pay Kefel, we can challenge this! A Shomer Sachar sometimes pays Kefel (when he claims that armed robbers took it), but a borrower never pays Kefel (so it is more lenient in this respect)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> This Tana holds that a Shomer Sachar is more lenient, since he can swear (that armed robbers took it) and be exempt, even though this can lead to paying Kefel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven rented a cow from Shimon, and it was stolen, and Reuven said 'I will pay and not swear', and the thief was found, he pays Kefel to Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> This is like R. Yehudah, who says that a renter is like a Shomer Sachar. Reuven said 'I will pay and not swear.' This implies that he could have sworn and not paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The case is, he claimed that armed robbers took it. If they are found later, they pay Kefel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Perhaps it is like R. Meir, who says that a renter is like a Shomer Chinam (and he claimed that a regular thief stole it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Perhaps it is like R. Yehudah, according to Rabah bar Avuha, who switches the opinions of R. Meir and R. Yehudah, and says that R. Yehudah holds that a renter is like a Shomer Chinam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #3 (R. Zeira):</span> The case is, Reuven claimed that armed robbers took it, and later, it was found that a thief took it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN AN ANIMAL PAYS AS MUCH AS IT BENEFITED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it fell into a garden and benefited, Reuven pays the benefit (not the full damage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The case is, it fell on fruits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that if it ate them, he does not pay at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like Rav holds, that the animal should not have eaten.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Rav said so only to exempt the owner of fruits, when the animal ate and was damaged. Rav would not say that this is a reason to exempt it when it damages!</p>
