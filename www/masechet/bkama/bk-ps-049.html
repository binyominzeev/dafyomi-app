<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO PAYS FOR A FETUS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> This cannot be. If so, she is worth more after birth!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we estimate how much the child is worth. He gives this to her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she has no husband, it goes to his heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If she was a freed slave or convert (and also her husband was a freed slave or convert, and he had no heirs) , there is no payment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The ox does not pay because it intended for an ox. Had it intended for her, it would pay. This refutes Rav Ada bar Ahavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> If an ox intended for a woman, it does not pay for the fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Even if it intended for her, it would not pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah discusses intent regarding an ox for parallel structure to the case of a man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If an ox gored a slave, and caused a miscarriage, it pays for the fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She is (her master's property), just like a pregnant donkey;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We read "Im (with) the donkey" - Am (a nation) that resembles a donkey.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE PAYMENTS FOR THE FETUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> To pay for the fetus, we evaluate...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should not say the value of the fetus, rather (Bach - the value of the fetus and) the added value due to of the fetus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Correct! The Mishnah asks, how do we evaluate the value of and added value due to of the fetus? We evaluate how much the mother was worth before giving birth and after giving birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> This cannot be. If so, she is worth more after birth!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean? (Chachamim (the first Tana) obligate paying the difference. Surely, they hold that she is worth less after birth!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> A woman is not worth less after birth, rather she is worth more (for she is no longer in danger);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we estimate how much the child is worth. He gives this to her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa #1):</span> A woman is not worth more before birth. Rather, she is worth more after birth!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we estimate how much the child is worth. He gives this to her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel asks, does the added value of a pregnant woman belong only to her husband, and not to herself?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we estimate how much the child is worth. He gives this to her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><i>Her</i> added value due to the pregnancy is shared with her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa #2 - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Does the added value of a pregnant woman belong only to her husband, and not to her herself?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we estimate the Nezek by itself, and the pain by itself, and give these to her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We evaluate the fetus. This goes to her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><i>Her</i> added value due to the pregnancy is shared with her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel contradicts himself in the two Beraisos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span>  Beraisa #1 discusses a woman giving birth the first time (she is in great danger, she is worth less before birth).  Beraisa #2 discusses a woman who already gave birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim say that the husband also gets her added value due to the pregnancy. What is their reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Question:</span> It says "and she lost her children." Why must it say (that she was) "pregnant"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that her added value due to the pregnancy goes to her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Shimon ben Gamliel learn from "pregnant"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches R. Eliezer ben Yakov's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> He pays for the fetus only if he hit her in the area of the fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This refers to anywhere where the heat of the blow will reach the child (the torso), i.e. excluding the legs and arms.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A CONVERT'S SHARE OF PAYMENT FOR THE FETUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she was a freed slave or a convert (and her husband was also, and he had no heirs), Reuven does not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> This is only if he hit her in her husband's lifetime, and then her husband died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At the time he hit her, the payment belongs to her husband. Once he dies, Reuven is exempted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he hit her after her husband died, he must pay her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Payment for the fetus is not something that can be transferred!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah said that the husband gets it. If there is no husband, it is not paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven hit a woman, making her lose her fetus, he pays Nezek and pain to her, and compensation for the fetus to her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the husband is dead, his heirs receive his share. If she died, her heirs receive her share.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she was a freed slave or a convert, he (Reuven) merits (to be exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Just like we explained that the Mishnah is when he hit her in her husband's lifetime, also the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He hit her even after her husband died. The Beraisa means, whoever merits, collects (i.e. if she was hit after her husband died, she collects).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue as Rabah and Rav Chisda do.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If a Bas Yisrael married a convert and became pregnant through him, and Reuven hit her (in her husband's lifetime, making her miscarry), he pays her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he hit her after her husband died, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> He is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Indeed, Rabah holds like Beraisa #1. He must admit that Beraisa #2 is like Rav Chisda.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, Rav Chisda can say that both Tana'im are like him. Beraisa #2 is like Chachamim. Beraisa #1 is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel (who says that she gets a share of her increased value).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Beraisa #1 is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel, why does it say that the husband died? Even if he is alive, she gets a share!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In his life, she only gets half. After he dies, she gets her entire increased value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Alternatively, Rav Chisda can say that both Beraisos are like R. Shimon ben Gamliel. Beraisa #2 discusses payment for the fetus. Beraisa #1 discusses payment for her increased value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn from her added value to payment for the fetus (just like she merits his share of her added value when he dies, also payment for the fetus),; and from R. Shimon ben Gamliel to Chachamim (that she merits what was due to her husband when he dies)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. She is party to her added value, so when he dies, she merits his share of it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She has no share of payment for the fetus. When he dies, she does not merit what was due to him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PROPERTY OF A CONVERT WHO DIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yeiva Sava):</span> If Reuven grabbed the documents of a convert who died (without heirs), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Did he grab them intending to acquire the land?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The land can be acquired only through Chazakah. He did not do this, so he gets neither the land nor the document;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, did he intend also for the parchment (and he acquires it)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Does he need a worthless document to use for a bottle-cork?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yeiva:</span> Yes! (I ask about this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If a convert (Yisro) had a security from Reuven, and Yisro died, and Shimon grabbed the security, he must give it to Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When Yisro died, his lien on the security ended.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If Reuven had a security from a convert (Yisro), and Yisro died and Shimon grabbed the security, Reuven collects the amount of his loan, and Shimon keeps the rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reuven's premises should acquire the entire security for him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> A person's yard acquires for him without his knowledge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, Reuven is not in the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(This answer holdsthat) whenever Reuven can acquire things, his yard can acquire for him; whenever Reuven cannot acquire (e.g. he is not here), his yard cannot acquire for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, the security is not in Reuven's yard. (If it were in his yard, he would acquire even if he were not there.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The Halachah follows this answer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>A PIT IN TWO DOMAINS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is liable for digging a pit in the following cases: it (the pit) is in a Reshus ha'Yachid, and its opening is in a Reshus ha'Rabim; it is in a Reshus ha'Rabim, and its opening is in a Reshus ha'Yachid, it and its opening are in each in a different Reshus ha'Yachid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> The Torah discusses (and obligates for) a pit in a Reshus ha'Yachid, its opening is in the Reshus ha'Rabim. (We call this a pit in the Reshus ha'Rabim);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says, it is when he made his property Hefker, but not his pit (we call this a pit in the Reshus ha'Rabim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> All agree that one is liable for a pit in a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> "If a man will open...or dig a pit" - if he is liable for opening it, all the more so for digging it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, this teaches that he is liable for digging alone (i.e. the pit is not his, it is in the Reshus ha'Rabim).</p>
