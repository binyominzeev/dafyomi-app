<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PAYMENT FROM AN OX THAT WILL BE KILLED (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava citing Rabanan):</span> The Beraisa is like Shimon ha'Teimani, who said 'just like the judges and witnesses can see his fist...' This implies that Beis Din must evaluate the item used to damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once Beis Din sentences the ox to be stoned, we do not delay to evaluate whether or not it was apt to cause the damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Beraisa is even like R. Akiva. The case is, the owner fled (and we cannot obligate a man who is not here).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he fled, even if they didn't judge the ox to stone it, we cannot judge the damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the owner fled after testimony was accepted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the owner is not here, who will pay?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The victim will rent out the ox for plowing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even regarding a Tam, we should first judge it to pay the damage through plowing, then judge it to stone it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mari brei d'Rav Kahana):</span> This shows that money that can be earned through plowing is not considered part of the ox (a Tam pays only up to the value of the animal.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EVALUATION OF DAMAGERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must we evaluate for damage (whether the damaging object was apt to cause the damage)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps we evaluate only by killing, for not everything can kill, but anything can (do some) damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, also for damage, we must evaluate the object.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> The Torah discusses a (standard) pit to teach that just like a pit is 10 Tefachim deep, which can kill, in all cases (pits of other shapes) one is liable for 10 Tefachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If an animal fell in a pit less than 10 Tefachim, if it died he is exempt. If it was hurt, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah considers from below (from shallow to deep), a pit between one Tefach and (but not including) 10 Tefachim is liable for damage, not for death;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This shows that any size can damage. No evaluation is needed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Mishnah considers from above (from deep to shallow). A pit of 10 Tefachim can kill. Slightly less than 10 Tefachim can damage, but cannot kill;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For damage, we must evaluate whether the object was apt to damage the injured party.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If a man hit his slave on the eye and blinded him, or on the ear and deafened him, the slave goes free;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he hit him near the eye and now the slave cannot see, or near the ear and now the slave cannot hear, the slave does not go free.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We say that the blow was not enough to blind or deafen him, because damages need evaluation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer to Question 2) :</span> No, we say that the slave blinded or deafened himself from fright.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one frightens someone, Beis Din does not make him pay, but he is liable b'Yedei Shamayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was Toke'a in his ear and deafened him, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he was holding him when he was Toke'a, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> For five payments we evaluate and make the damager pay immediately. For Refu'ah and Sheves, we estimate how much they will be until the victim recovers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did not recover as quickly as expected, he only gets the amount of the evaluation;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If recovered sooner than expected, he gets the entire evaluation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This teaches that we evaluate for damages!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We knew that we estimate how long he will be bedridden. The question was whether or not we must evaluate if the object used to damage was apt fitting to damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa - Shimon ha'Teimani):</span> " When a man will hit his fellow man with a rock or his fist" - just like the judges and witnesses can see his fist (and gauge whether or not it is apt to cause the damage that resulted), they must see anything used to hit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that we evaluate for damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If recovered sooner than expected, he gets the entire evaluation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This supports Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If we estimated that a man will be bedridden the entire day, and he recovered in the middle of the day and was able to work, this was Hash-m's kindness upon him. He receives Sheves for the entire day.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PAYMENT FOR EMBARRASSMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Levi spat at David, and the spit reached him...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is only if the spit landed on him. If it landed on his clothing, Levi is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if it lands on his clothing, this is no less than verbal embarrassment!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Avin):</span> Our Mishnah teaches that one is exempt for verbal embarrassment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The payment is according to his prestige.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the first Tana teach a leniency or a stringency?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he teaches a leniency, less distinguished people receive less than 400;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he teaches a stringency, more distinguished people receive more than 400.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> We view even the poorest Bnei Yisrael as if they were rich people who lost their money, for they descend from Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that the first Tana teaches a leniency.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in which a man uncovered a woman's head... (R. Akiva agreed to give him time to pay.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chanina taught that if one damaged someone, we do not give him to time to pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to damage that causes monetary loss. Embarrassment causes no loss.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HARMING ONESELF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The man waited for her... (R. Akiva told him... 'one may not injure himself...')</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> You toiled for naught. One may injure himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> One may not bodily injure himself, but he may embarrass himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah discusses embarrassment, and R. Akiva said that one may not injure himself!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">91b----------------------------------------91b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He told the man as follows. Not only regarding embarrassment, in which Reuven may embarrass himself, (even if Reuven does so) if Shimon embarrasses him he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even regarding bodily damage, in which Reuven may not damage himself, (even if Reuven damages himself and shows that he does not care,) if Shimon damages him, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may damage himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one who swore to harm himself and did not do so is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "(If one swore) to harm or to benefit..." - just like the benefit discussed is optional (not a Mitzvah), also the harm. This includes one who swore to harm himself (he is liable if he does not do so).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> The Beraisa discusses an oath to fast.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa (Shevu'os 27b) also discusses harming others. Can one make others fast?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes, he locks them in a room without food!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa):</span> The oath to harm others is 'I will hit Ploni' or 'I will bruise his brain.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Questions (b) and (g)):</span> Tana'im argue about this. (Each Tana holds that R. Akiva agrees with him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana forbids one to damage himself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> "The blood of your souls I will demand" - I will demand of your souls, your blood (that you yourselves spilled).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps only suicide is forbidden, but not wounding oneself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> We tear clothing out of grief over a death. This is not forbidden due to 'Darkei ha'Emori (following Nochri practices)';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar says, one who tears too much transgresses 'Bal Tashchis (wastefully destroying)'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All the more so, R. Elazar holds that one who damages his body transgresses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps damaging one's body is less severe, for the damage can heal, unlike tearing clothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan would call his garments 'what honors me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When Rav Chisda would walk among thorns, he would lift his garment, because damage to the body heals, but damage to clothes does not heal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Answer #3 (Beraisa - R. Eliezer Hakapar b'Ribi) Question: "V'Chiper Alav me'Asher Chata Al ha'Nefesh" - against (or regarding) which soul did he sin?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He pained his own soul by denying himself wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who denies himself wine is called a sinner. All the more so, one who (fasts and) denies himself all food sins!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>CUTTING TREES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who cuts his young trees...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven claimed against Shimon 'you killed my ox' (or) 'you cut my young trees', and Shimon answered 'you told me to do so', he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav):</span> A damager cannot exempt himself by saying this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar bar Chanah:</span> There is a mistake in the text. I will no longer recite the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> The text is correct. The Beraisa discusses an ox that must be killed or a tree that must be cut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what was Reuven's claim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He wanted to do the Mitzvah himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He will spill (the blood of a wild animal or bird) and cover" - the one who slaughters covers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Gamliel once obligated a man to pay 10 gold coins for covering the blood of what another man had slaughtered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may not cut a date tree that bears a Kav of dates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> An olive tree that bears a quarter Kav of olives may not be cut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The amount for olive trees is smaller, for olives are more important than dates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> My son died only because he cut a fig tree prematurely.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> If the wood is worth more than the fruit, one may cut it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "Only a tree that you know" refers to a fruit-bearing tree (you may cut it when besieging a city). "That it is not a fruit tree" refers to a barren tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we may cut even fruit-bearing trees, why does the verse allude to a barren tree?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may cut fruit trees only if there are no barren trees there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one may not cut a tree even if its wood is worth more than its fruit (if barren trees are around)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Only" excludes this.</p>
