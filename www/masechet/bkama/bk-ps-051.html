<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 51 - Dedicated in memory of Nachum ben Shlomo Dovid Mosenkis Z"L by his son and daughter-in-law,  by Mr. and Mrs. Sid Mosenkis (of Queens, N.Y.), in honor of his 69th Yahrzeit on 23 Teves 5769. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A PIT LESS THAN 10 <i>TEFACHIM</i> DEEP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> No, he is exempt because it does not have Hevel. (Only the blow can kill. Rav Nachman holds like Rav, who exempts for the blow.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why is one liable if the animal was hurt?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Hevel cannot kill, but it can damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The scaffold for people sentenced to stoning was twice a person's height. (They were pushed off the scaffold, and stoned if they did not die from the fall.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Including his own height, the person would fall three times his height.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> If the blow of a fall even less than 10 Tefachim can kill, why did the scaffold need to be so high?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Even if you hold that only the blow of a fall from 10 Tefachim can kill, the scaffold could have been 10 Tefachim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> Rav Nachman taught "you will love your neighbor as yourself" - choose a nice execution for him (so he will die quickly).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the scaffold should be even higher!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That would be disgraceful, for his limbs would break off.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One must build a Ma'akah (wall) around his roof, lest "one will fall from it (the roof)", but not (if the concern is lest one fall) into the roof.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the roof is 10 Tefachim below street level, the concern is lest one fall onto the roof. It is exempt from a Ma'akah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When the roof is 10 Tefachim above street level, the concern is lest one fall from the roof. It must have a Ma'akah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> If the blow of a fall even less than 10 Tefachim can kill, even less than 10 Tefachim should require a Ma'akah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A house less than 10 Tefachim tall is not considered a house, so the Torah did not obligate it to have a Ma'akah (even though one could die from falling from the roof).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even when the roof is exactly 10 Tefachim above the street, the house is not considered a house, for the interior is less than 10 Tefachim (the roof has thickness)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the floor of the house was dug out, so the roof is 10 Tefachim above the floor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even if the roof is less than 10 Tefachim above the street, it should require a Ma'akah when the floor was dug out, making the roof 10 Tefachim above the floor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Rav Nachman admits that only a blow from a fall of 10 Tefachim can kill;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He ruled that the ox that fell from the irrigation ditch (which is normally six Tefachim) was Tereifah, because the ox' stomach starts four Tefachim above the ground, so it fell 10 Tefachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that 10 Tefachim are needed to kill. We should say that six Tefachim suffice!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We require 10 for an animal that was lying on the ground and rolled into the pit. (R. Efrayim - we always requires 10 from the stomach to the bottom. Normally, it was lying, so the pit itself must be 10. Rashba - the Torah obligates only for a pit of 10 that can kill in any case, even if it was lying.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A PIT OF PARTNERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven and Shimon were partners in a pit, and Reuven passed and did not cover it, and Shimon passed by and did not cover it, Shimon is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the case of a pit of partners?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not difficult for R. Akiva, who obligates for a pit in one's premises. They are partners in a pit in their joint yard, and they made the yard Hefker but not the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to the opinion that exempts for a pit in one's premises, what is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The pit is in a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of a joint pit in a Reshus ha'Rabim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they asked Levi to dig it, one cannot be a Shali'ach for a transgression (Levi alone is liable)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven dug five Tefachim and Shimon dug the last five Tefachim, Shimon takes full responsibility for it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> According to Rebbi, both are liable for damages. (The argument of Rebbi and Chachamim is brought below.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of a joint pit in a Reshus ha'Rabim, according to Chachamim regarding death and damages, and according to Rebbi regarding death?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The case is, they jointly removed the layer of dirt that completed the pit to a depth of 10 Tefachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the argument of Rebbi and Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven dug nine Tefachim, and Shimon dug another Tefach, Shimon is responsible for the pit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi says, Shimon is liable if an animal dies there. Both are liable for damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 - Question:</span> "If a man will open...or dig a pit" - if he is liable for opening it, all the more so he is liable for digging it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, this teaches that if Shimon finishes digging a pit that Reuven started, Shimon is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says, we need both verses, like above (that even one who digs a pit is exempt if he covers it, and even one who opens a pit is liable if he does not cover it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Chachamim also need both verses to teach this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They learn from "if a man will dig a pit", not two men.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi expounds "if a man will dig a pit", but not if an ox will make a pit (one is exempt for an obstacle his ox creates).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, another verse says "if a man will open a pit", so we learn both laws!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi says, we learn from one verse. The other uses the same expression for parallel structure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to Chachamim) why is the one who completes it liable, not the one who starts it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "(Ba'al ha'Bor will pay...) and the dead animal will be to him (its original owner)" teaches that the one who enabled the pit to kill is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need that verse to teach Rava's law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "And the dead animal will be to him" - one is liable only when the carcass is permitted. This excludes a blemished Korban that fell in a pit. (The only benefit permitted from a blemished Korban is to eat it. Since it died without slaughter, one may not use the meat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes, it teaches Rava's law; automatically, we also learn that Ba'al ha'Bor is the one who enabled death!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MAKING A PIT DEEPER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If Reuven dug 10 Tefachim, Shimon dug another 10, and Levi dug another 10, all are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> If Reuven dug 10 Tefachim, and Shimon plastered it (which intensifies the Hevel inside), Shimon is liable.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">51b----------------------------------------51b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Beraisa #1 is like Rebbi, and Beraisa #2 is like Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav Zvid):</span> No, both are like Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim exempt the first digger only when he did not dig an amount fitting to kill. When he dug an amount fitting to kill, they agree that all are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In Beraisa #2, Reuven dug 10 Tefachim, and he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the Hevel could not have killed until Shimon plastered it (it was wider than deep).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rav Zvid):</span> No, both are like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beraisa #1 says, all are liable. Clearly, this is like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In Beraisa #2, only Shimon is liable. The case is, before it was plastered, the Hevel could not even damage. After it was plastered, the Hevel can damage and kill.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Reuven dug nine Tefachim. Shimon placed a rock by the opening, causing the floor to be 10 Tefachim below the opening. Rebbi and Chachamim argue (if Reuven is also liable for damage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that when Shimon digs another Tefach, we attribute the damaging Hevel to him, but here, the Hevel (at the bottom) is not due to Shimon. Rava teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If Reuven dug nine Tefachim, and Shimon dug another Tefach, then filled in that extra Tefach, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that he undid his action?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, once he completed it to 10 Tefachim, he assumed sole responsibility for it, so even when he fills in the last Tefach, he remains responsible!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OTHER FACTORS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> If the bottom two Tefachim of an eight Tefachim pit are filled with water, it is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One Tefach of water is like two Tefachim of air.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the bottom Tefach of a nine Tefachim pit is filled with water, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since there is less water (than an eight Tefachim pit with two Tefachim of water), its Hevel cannot kill;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since it is deeper, it can kill.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the bottom three Tefachim of a seven Tefachim pit are filled with water, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since there is more water, its Hevel can kill;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since it is not as deep, it cannot kill.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>These questions are unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shizbi):</span> If Shimon widened Reuven's pit, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> He reduced the Hevel, so he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Shizbi):</span> Just the opposite! He brought the damage closer (for animals to fall in)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> If the animal died from the Hevel, this is not due to Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it died from the blow, he brought the damage closer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> If the animal fell in from the side Shimon added, Shimon is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it fell in from the other side, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah or Rav Yosef, citing R. Mani):</span> If a pit is as wide as it is deep, it can kill. If it is wider, it cannot;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rabah and Rav Yosef, citing R. Mani):</span> A pit can kill only if it is deeper than wide.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHICH PARTNER IS RESPONSIBLE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the first partner (Reuven) passed by and did not cover it...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is Reuven exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah or Rav Yosef, citing R. Mani):</span> He is exempt if he left the other partner (Shimon) using it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of Rabah and Rav Yosef, citing R. Mani):</span> He is exempt if he handed over the cover to Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>They argue like the following Tana'im</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven was drawing water from a pit, and Shimon (his partner) said 'let me draw', once Reuven lets him use it, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, when he hands over the cover to Shimon, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov holds that Yesh Bereirah. (This is not the usual Bereirah. Here it means that the terms of the partnership are that each totally owns  it at the time he uses it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Shimon draws, he draws from his half. Reuven is always responsible for his half, unless he gave over the cover, for then Shimon is the guardian over the whole well;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that Ein Bereirah. When Shimon draws, he borrows Reuven's half, and is responsible for the whole well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> This is like they argue about partners in a yard.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If vows forbid partners (in a yard) from benefiting from each other, neither may enter the yard;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, each enters his own half.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov holds that Yesh Bereirah. When Shimon enters, he enters his half;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Chachamim hold that Ein Bereirah. When Shimon enters, he benefits from Reuven's half.</p>
