<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MUST CHILDREN PAY FOR THEIR FATHER'S TRANSGRESSION?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Ada bar Ahavah - (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven collected Ribis, and he died, even if his children know that the money was from Ribis, they need not return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> This teaches that heirs are like buyers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Really, heirs are not like buyers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ribis is different, because it says "do not take from him interest and Ribis (and your brother will live with you" - return it to him in order that he will live with you;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah commanded only the lender, but not his son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Ada bar Ahavah says that Rami bar Chama derived from the Beraisa of Ribis that heirs are like buyers. All the more so, he may derive this from our Mishnah (the heirs may keep the money, even though no verse teaches this);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Version #1 says that Rami bar Chama derived from our Mishnah that heirs are as buyers. He would not derive this from the Beraisa, like Rava's objection.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one stole and fed his children (what he stole), they are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If he left the theft in front of them, if they are adults, they are liable. If they are minors, they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If his adult children say 'we do not know our father's dealings with you', they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why do they exempt themselves by saying this?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rava):</span> Rather, if they say 'we know our father's dealings with you. He did not owe you anything', they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If one stole and fed his children, they are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>If he left the theft in front of them and they ate, whether they are adults or minors, they are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why are minors liable? This is no worse than damage, for which they are exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Papa):</span> Rather, if he left the theft in front of them and they did not yet eat it, whether they are adults or minors, they are liable.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN DOES LIABILITY COME?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven borrowed a cow and died, leaving it to his children, they may use it as long as Reuven borrowed it for. If it dies through Ones, they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If they thought it was their father's and slaughtered and ate it, they pay a discounted price for the meat (two thirds of the standard price).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven left them property with Achrayus, they are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> This refers to the first law (if it dies through Ones, they are exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> This refers to the second law (if they ate it, they pay a discounted price for the meat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Version #1 surely agrees to (the law of) Version #2, and argues with Rav Papa (below);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Version #2 argues with Version #1, like Rav Papa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If Reuven stole a cow and slaughtered it on Shabbos, he pays (five cows), because he was liable even before he transgressed Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he borrowed a cow and slaughtered it on Shabbos, he is exempt, because the theft and transgression of Shabbos come simultaneously.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DO WE ACCEPT WITNESSES IN THE DEFENDANT'S ABSENCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He will returned the stolen object that he stole" it must be like he stole. From here, Chachamim learned that if one stole and fed his children, they are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he left the theft in front of them, whether they are adults or minors, they are liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Sumchus says, adults are liable and minors are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The son of R. Yirmiyah's father-in-law (was a minor; he) locked the door to prevent R. Yirmiyah from making a Chazakah on his father's house (after his father died). R. Yirmiyah came before R. Avin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Avin:</span> The son is justified. It is his house!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmiyah:</span> I have witnesses that I made a Chazakah on the house in his father's lifetime (it was a gift or sale)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Avin:</span> We do not accept witnesses in the defendant's absence. A minor is not considered to be present!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">112b----------------------------------------112b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> (If he left the theft in front of them) whether they are adults or minors, they are liable. (This shows that we accept testimony about minors!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avin):</span> Sumchus argues, and exempts minors (because we do not accept testimony against them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmiyah:</span> Do you hold like Sumchus, to deprive me of my house?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The case came to R. Avahu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Avahu:</span> R. Oshiya ruled that if a child took someone's slaves and claimed them, we do not wait until he matures. Rather, we return the slaves immediately. When the child matures, he can bring witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is different, for the child had no Chazakah on the slaves. Here, the child is in place of his father, who had a Chazakah on the house!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> We accept witnesses in the defendant's absence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yochanan):</span> We do not accept witnesses in the defendant's absence!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> If the claiming party is sick, or if the witnesses must leave town, and the defendant was summonsed and did not come, we accept witnesses in his absence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> We accept witnesses in the defendant's absence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Ukva):</span> Shmuel said this only when they opened the case (the litigants made their claims in front of Beis Din), one side later brought witnesses, and the other side did not come;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they did not open the case, he can say that he wants to go to the great Beis Din (in Eretz Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if the case was opened, the defendant can say that he wants to go to the great Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The case is, the great Beis Din sent a letter saying that the local Beis Din should judge the case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We validate documents in the absence of a party to the document;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We do not validate documents in the absence of a party to the document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> R. Yochanan learns from "(if) testimony was given (that an ox gored) in front of the owner, and he will not guard it" - the owner must be there.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>COLLECTION FROM ONE WHO DOES NOT PAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is, we validate documents in the absence of a party to the document (Reuven), and even if he protests;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he requests time to find witnesses that can discredit the document, we grant him time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he does not come (with witnesses nor to pay), we warn him three times, Monday, Thursday, and Monday;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he still does not come, we write a Pesichah (document of excommunication).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>For 90 days, we do not confiscate his property (to pay his debt).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first 30 days, we assume that he is trying to borrow the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The next 30 days, we suppose that perhaps he is trying to sell things to raise the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The last 30 days, we suppose that perhaps he found a buyer, but the buyer has not yet raised the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If he does not come within 90 days, we write an Adrachta (a document authorizing the lender (Shimon) to take Reuven's property for payment).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>All this applies only if Reuven said that he would come. If he said that he would not come, we write an Adrachta immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>All this applies only regarding a loan. Regarding a deposit, we write an Adrachta immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>We write an Adrachta only against land, but not on Metaltelim. We are concerned lest Shimon consume them, and Reuven will later bring witnesses discrediting the document, and Shimon will not have anything to return to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon has land, we may write an Adrachta on Reuven's Metaltelim. We are not concerned lest Shimon not have anything to return to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even if he has land, we do not write an Adrachta on Metaltelim, lest Shimon cause the land to decrease in value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>We do not write an Adrachta on Reuven's Metaltelim before informing him, but only if he is nearby;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if he is far away, but we can inform him through relatives or caravans that will go to where he is and return, we wait up to 12 months to inform him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ravina made Acha wait 12 months before writing an Adrachta for him, until a caravan went to and returned from Bei Chuzai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Acha was an exception. He was powerful. When he receives an Adrachta, it is impossible to retrieve property from him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Normally, we wait (on Monday) only if a Shali'ach can reach Reuven on Tuesday and return on Wednesday, so Beis Din can finish the case on Thursday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> A Shali'ach of Beis Din is believed like two witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only regarding excommunication (if he says that Reuven refuses to come), but not to write a Pesichah, for this will cost Reuven money. He must pay the scribe when he wants to end the excommunication.</p>
