<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH ANSWER DID R. ELIEZER GIVE FIRST?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> He first answered that it intended for an animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Tavyumi):</span> He first answered that one witness or the owner told us that it killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Kahana holds that even though the case of intent for an animal is a better answer, when he thought of another answer, he gave it as well.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Tavyumi holds that once he thought of the better answer, he discarded the inferior answer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES A <i>TAM</i> PAY FOR KILLING A FETUS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> "The owner of the ox is clean" from paying for a miscarriage aborted (due to the ox goring the mother).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> We learn from "when men will fight", not oxen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Yosi ha'Glili disagree?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ula brei d'Rav Idi):</span> R. Akiva's verse does not suffice!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that it excludes only oxen that resemble men, i.e. Mu'adim, but a Tam pays. "The owner of the ox is clean" teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> How could one think that a Mu'ad is exempt and a Tam is liable?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, one might have thought that R. Akiva's verse excludes oxen that resemble men, i.e. Mu'adim, and all the more so a Tam is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The owner of the ox is clean" teaches that only a Tam is exempt, but a Mu'ad is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, we should say the same about embarrassment!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We exclude (from paying for embarrassment) oxen that resemble men, i.e. Mu'adim, all the more so a Tam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"The owner of the ox is clean" teaches that only a Tam is exempt, but a Mu'ad is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Yosi ha'Glili holds this way!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, R. Yosi ha'Glili should have expounded "the owner of the ox is clean" to exempt from paying for an aborted fetus and embarrassment!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye and Rava):</span> When men fight, if the woman lives, they pay (for the fetus), and if she dies, they are exempt (from paying, since they are liable to death);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that oxen are liable in either case. "The owner of the ox is clean" teaches that oxen are always exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The exemption of men does not depend on a fatality, rather on intent! (Rashi - men are liable even if she dies, if they did not intend to kill her. Tosfos - Abaye and Rava exempt only oxen like men, i.e. that did not intend for her, but obligate an ox that intentionally gored her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> When men fight, intending for each other, even if the woman dies, they pay (for the fetus). When they intend for her, they are exempt (if she dies);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that oxen are liable in either case. "The owner of the ox is clean" teaches that (Tam) oxen are always exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Chagai taught a Beraisa supporting Rav Ada bar Ahavah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>TAM</i> DOES NOT PAY FOR KILLING A SLAVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "The owner of the ox is clean" from the 30 Shekalim for killing a slave.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva should challenge himself like he challenged R. Eliezer (41b 3:a:1)! A Tam pays only from itself. Since we may not benefit from the damager, obviously it does not pay 30 Shekalim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> The case is, the owner slaughtered it first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that the 30 Shekalim are paid from it. R. Akiva teaches that this is not so. Since it should be killed, even if it was slaughtered, we do not collect from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did R. Akiva ask against R. Eliezer? There also, one might have thought that if it was slaughtered, we collect from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva wanted to see if R. Eliezer had a better answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Eliezer give this answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When the ox killed without intent, it is not killed at all. One might have thought it pays Kofer. R. Eliezer teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, the ox should be killed. No verse is needed to exempt from Kofer, even if it was slaughtered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (and retraction of Answer #1:</span> Surely, R. Akiva agrees to this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Asi):</span> Since R. Akiva holds that a Tam that gores a man pays full damage (less what the man damaged it), one might have thought it pays 30 Shekalim of a slave from the Aliyah, like a Mu'ad. "The owner of the ox is clean" teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Zeira - Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "Like this law will be done to it" - a Tam pays only from its own value, not from the Aliyah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> We need a verse to teach that a Tam does not pay for a slave, because the Torah was more stringent about a slave than about a free man (and pays from the Aliyah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kofer is only the person's value, but one pays 30 Shekalim even for a slave worth one Sela!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "The owner of the ox is clean" from paying for a slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches this! One pays the full value of a free man, yet this is only for a Mu'ad. A Tam is exempt. One never pays more than 30 for a slave, all the more so a Tam is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah was more stringent about a slave! For a free man, one pays only his value. One pays 30 Shekalim even for a slave worth one Sela! Therefore, the verse is needed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHO INHERITS PAYMENTS DUE TO A WOMAN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva) Question:</span> Why must it say "and it killed a man or woman"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"If an ox will gore a man or woman" already obligates for a woman like for a man!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it equates a woman to a man: just like damage payments due to a man go to his heirs, also payments due to a woman go to her heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Akiva hold that a man doesn't inherit his wife?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "He will inherit her" teaches that a man inherits his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> Since Kofer is not paid in her lifetime, only after death, it is only Ra'uy (apt to come). A husband inherits only what was Muchzak (in her possession), not what was Ra'uy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Kofer only paid only after death? (It should be paid once we anticipate that the victim will die!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "And it killed a man or woman, the ox will be stoned (...Kofer will be placed)" - Kofer is only after stoning, which is after the victim dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva said so (that he does not inherit them) even about damages (that are paid in her lifetime)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man hit a woman, making her miscarry, he pays Nezek and pain to her, and compensation for the fetus to her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If there is no husband (he died), his heirs receive his share. If she died, her heirs receive her share (of payments for Nezek and pain. Her husband does not inherit it!).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If she was a freed slave or a convert (and her husband is also, and they died without heirs), the damager is exempt.</p>
