<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA KAMA 21 - Dedicated by Andy & Nancy Neff in memory of Leah Miriam bat Yisroel who passed away on 14 Sivan 5767 -- Lucy Rabin, beloved wife of Sidney Rabin and mother of Nancy Neff and Valerie, Doug and Andy Rabin. <br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 21-25 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the ninth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MUST ONE PAY FOR BENEFIT DERIVED FROM ANOTHER'S PROPERTY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba bar Zavda):</span> If Levi lived in Yehudah's yard without Yehudah's knowledge, must he pay him rent?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Rav Huna, citing Rav):</span> No; and one who rents a house from Reuven must pay to Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is Shimon involved?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if one rented a house from Reuven, and it was found to be Shimon's, he pays rent to Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This contradicts his answer to the question!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it is not normally rented, he is exempt. If it is normally rented, he must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> If Levi lived in Yehudah's yard without Yehudah's knowledge, he need not pay. If one rents a house from people of the city, he pays rent to the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What owner does he discuss?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> If it is found to have an owner, he pays rent to the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This contradicts the first law he said!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He must pay only if it was normally rented.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sechorah):</span> If Levi lived in Yehudah's yard without Yehudah's knowledge, he need not pay. We learn from "She'iyah (desolation) breaks the gates." (It benefits Yehudah if someone is there!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Mar bar Rav Ashi:</span> I saw it. It gored like an ox. (Rashi - She'iyah is a Shed. Ramah, in Nimukei Yosef - it is mold, and it damaged like a goring ox.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> A settled house will last.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference is between Rav Sechorah's teaching and Rav Yosef's?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Yehudah was storing wood or straw in the house, according to Rav Sechorah, the house would have lasted anyway, so Levi must pay. According to Rav Yosef, Levi gave benefit to Yehudah, so he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>A man built a house on a dumpsite of orphans. Rav Nachman forced him to pay rent for the time he lived in the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that one who lives in Reuven's yard without Reuven's knowledge must pay Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Originally, other people were living there and paying a modest rent to the orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nachman told the man to appease the orphans. He didn't, so Rav Nachman collected the house from him (until he gave the orphans a proper price for a ruin on which to build a house - Rosh).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>STRETCHING FROM <i>RESHUS</i> <i>HA'RABIM</i> TO EAT FROM <i>RESHUS</i> <i>HA'YACHID</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mishnah):</span> It pays for the benefit...(if it ate from the side of the Rechavah, it pays the damage (Rashi - half-damage)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The case is, it stretched its neck to eat from the side of the Rechavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Even that case it is exempt (it pays only for the benefit).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Shmuel, when does the Mishnah obligate paying the damage?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is when the animal left the Rechavah and went to the side.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav):</span> If an animal stretched its neck to eat from the side of the Rechavah, it pays full damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is exempt. (In this version, Rav and Shmuel did not come to explain the Mishnah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Shmuel, when does the Mishnah say that Shen pays the damage?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is when the animal left the Rechavah and went to the side.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Mishnah):</span> If it ate from the entrance to a store, it pays what it benefited.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Isn't the case when it stretched its neck!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> No. The case is, the store is on a corner (of the alley; the animal can eat without stretching its neck).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (Rav and Shmuel):</span> If an animal stretched its neck to eat food from the side of the Rechavah, it pays the damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one allowed people to walk on his property adjacent to the Rechavah, and an animal ate there, the owner is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Here also, he pays the damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about a pit (obstacle) on private property (that one was Mafkir).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav says that one is liable for such a pit. Therefore, (food or anything else he leaves there that could damage is Hefker, so) one who eats from there is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel exempts for such a pit, so (his food is not Hefker, so) one who eats from there must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Perhaps Rav normally exempts for such a pit. Here is different, for his food was too close to the Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Perhaps Shmuel normally obligates for such a pit, for animals (which may walk there) do not see it. Animals see food, so he is not liable for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about stretching to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir and R. Yehudah):</span> If an animal ate from the Rechavah, it pays what it benefited. If it ate from the side of the Rechavah, it pays the damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi and R. Elazar say, it is not normal to eat, only to walk.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Tana'im agree (that one is liable for the side of the Rechavah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about stretching to eat. The first Tana'im obligate paying only the benefit, and the latter Tana'im obligate paying the damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No. All agree about stretching (like Rav or Shmuel). They argue about "it will consume in another's field";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana'im expound "in another's field", but not in the Reshus ha'Rabim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The latter Tana'im expound "in another's field", but not in the damager's domain;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely he is exempt in the damager's domain. He had no right to bring his food in!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Rather, they (agree about stretching to eat from the side of the Rechavah, but) argue about Ilfa and R. Oshiya (20a, stretching to eat from another animal's load, and jumping).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DAMAGE CAUSED BY JUMPING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a dog or kid jumped from the roof and broke Kelim, it pays full damage, because it is Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a dog took a cake (with a coal inside) to a pile of grain, and ate the cake and burned the grain, it pays full damage for the cake and half-damage for the grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Inference):</span> It is liable only because it jumped. Had it fallen, it would be exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana holds that one who was negligent at the beginning and Ones (blameless) at the end, he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a dog or kid jumped from the roof and broke Kelim, it pays full damage. If it fell, it is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that one who was negligent at the beginning and Ones at the end, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that he is liable, how can we explain the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kelim are close to the wall, so if the dog or kid jumps, it will not break them. Therefore, it was not negligent to allow them on the roof. (R. Peretz - we obligate for jumping and breaking Kelim far away. Regarding Kelim nearby, this is considered Ones. Rashba - 'negligent at the beginning' applies only to total negligence. Here, it is not utter negligence, for usually they will not break Kelim by jumping, but it is not called unusual to exempt from full damage.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid):</span> Sometimes it is liable even for falling (according to both opinions), e.g. if the Ma'akah (a wall around a roof so people will not fall) is weak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, this obligates the owner because he should have realized that bricks [of the Ma'akah] might fall;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the end, bricks did not fall. The dog or kid fell. The beginning was negligence, the end was Ones! (How can we explain according to the opinion that exempts for this?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Ma'akah is Tzar (narrow; alternatively, sloped. In either case, animals are prone to jump on it and fall off.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If a dog or kid jumped up (and damaged), it is exempt. If it jumped down, it is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>People and chickens are liable for jumping up or down.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> A dog or kid is exempt for jumping up or down.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> They acted abnormally. The dog jumped, and the kid dug its hooves in the wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why are they exempt (this is Keren)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are exempt from full damage, but pay half- damage. (Also in Beraisa #1, for jumping up they are exempt from full damage, but pay half damage.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rif, Rambam) Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> A dog or kid is liable for jumping up or down.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> In Beraisa #1, they acted abnormally. The dog jumped, and the kid dug its hooves into the wall.</p>
