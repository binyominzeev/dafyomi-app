<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA KAMA 95 (30 Av) - Today's study material has been dedicated by Al and Sophie Ziegler of Har Nof, Yerushalayim, in honor of the Yahrzeit of Al's father, Bernard B. Ziegler - Binyamin Baruch ben Avraham (and Miryam), which occurs on 30 Menachem Av. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN DOES THE ENACTMENT APPLY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The enactment was made due to a case in which a man didn't repent lest he need to return his belt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It meant, lest he need to return the value of his belt (the belt itself was not stolen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that the enactment does not apply if the stolen object is still here?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There was an enactment to help penitents that if one built a stolen beam into a building, he returns only its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That case is different. (Letter of the law, he must dissemble the building.) The loss is so great, that Chachamim consider it as if the beam is not here.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES <i>SHINUY</i> ACQUIRE A STOLEN OBJECT ACCORDING TO R. MEIR?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he stole a pregnant cow and it gave birth...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one stole a sheep and sheared it, or a cow and it gave birth, he pays for it and its shearings and children;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, he returns the stolen animal itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon says, we view what the animal was worth at the time of the theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he hold that Shinuy does not acquire?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does he hold that Shinuy Koneh, but here we fine the thief, lest he profit from his sin?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make which is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It determines what he pays for a stolen animal that changed and declined in value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If a thief stole an animal or slaves and they grew old, he pays like the time of the theft;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says, regarding slaves he says 'here are your slaves.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Regarding animals, R. Meir agrees that he pays like the time of the theft;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he held that Ein Shinuy Koneh, also regarding animals he should allow saying 'here are your animals'!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rather, he must hold that Shinuy Koneh. When the stolen object rises in value, we fine the thief so he will not profit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. R. Meir addresses Chachamim's opinion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I hold that Ein Shinuy Koneh. Even regarding animals, he can say 'here is your animal';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>You hold that Shinuy Koneh. You should agree about slaves, for they are equated to land and cannot be stolen!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim disagree. They hold that slaves are not like land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Reuven gave wool to Shimon to dye red, and he dyed it black, or vice-versa - Shimon pays him the value of the wool he received.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He only pays the value of the wool, not the added value of dyed wool.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he held that Ein Shinuy Koneh, he should pay for dyed wool!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He must hold that Shinuy Koneh (and in the Beraisa, we fine the thief).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Surely, R. Meir holds that Shinuy Koneh, for Rav switched the opinions in the Mishnah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav's version of the Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a thief stole an animal or slaves and they grew old, he pays like the time of the theft;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, regarding slaves he says 'here are your slaves.'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In our Beraisa, R. Meir fines the thief so he will not profit.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FINING THE THIEF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Meir fine only a Mezid thief, or even one who b'Shogeg took another's animal (e.g. he bought it from the thief)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> Five kinds of payments are collected only from Bnei Chorin (i.e. but not from property bought from the one who owes):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Peros (this is explained below);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Improvements (this is explained below);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who accepted to feed his wife's child (from a previous husband);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A loan document that does not put a lien on land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>A Kesuvah that does not put a lien on land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of this Beraisa, who holds that a document does not automatically put a lien on land?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa lists Peros and improvements. What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reuven stole Shimon's land and sold it to Levi, who improved it. When Shimon takes back the land, Levi can collect what he paid from Reuven's Meshu'abadim (property that he sold), and the value of his improvements from Reuven's Bnei Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">95b----------------------------------------95b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Levi is an ignoramus, who does not know whether or not land is (legally considered) stolen, and still Shimon collects the land and its improvements.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This teaches that R. Meir fines even if the thief was Shogeg!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, Levi is a Chacham (he knows that land is not stolen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven gave wool to Shimon to dye red, and he dyed it black, or vice-versa, Shimon pays to him the value of the wool that he received.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He only pays the value of the wool, not the added value of dyed wool.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If R. Meir fines even for Shogeg, Shimon should pay for dyed wool!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> R. Meir fines only one who stole b'Mezid.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>IMPROVEMENTS ON THE STOLEN OBJECT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> He returns the stolen animal itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon says, we view the thief like a Shomer guarding an animal whose value was assessed (at the time of the theft).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zvid):</span> They argue about improvements to the stolen object.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah holds that the owner keeps the improvements, and R. Shimon holds that the thief gets them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> All agree that the thief receives improvements on the stolen object;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah holds that the thief keeps all the improvements. R. Shimon holds that the thief keeps a half, third or quarter (like people who raise others' animals normally receive).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he stole a cow and it became pregnant and gave birth, or a sheep and it became laden with wool and he sheared it, he pays the value at the time he stole it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had it not given birth, he would return the cow itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, according to Rav Zvid, the Mishnah is like R. Yehudah, who says that the owner gets all improvements on the stolen object;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, Rav Papa holds that all agree that the thief gets (at least part of) the improvements. The Mishnah is not as either Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Papa explains that even had it not given birth, he pays the value at the time he stole it (the Mishnah is like R. Yehudah, who says that the thief gets all improvements);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah said that it gave birth for parallel structure to the previous case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Papa - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> We view the animal as if its value was assessed (at the time of the theft) for one who raises another's animal to keep a half, third or quarter of the improvement.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> R. Shimon says that the thief gets a half, third or quarter of the improvement. Does he get money, or can he demand some of the meat of the animal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> We learn from Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> In three cases, we evaluate the improvements and they are paid with money:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A firstborn who gets an extra share of property that all the brothers improved after the father died (he pays their share of the improvements);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>A creditor who takes land that people bought from the borrower (the creditor pays for the improvements that they made);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>A creditor who takes land from the orphans of the borrower.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(R. Chananel, brought in Rashba - in all other cases, the improvements are collected from the matter itself; Tosfos - a thief receives money, just like these cases.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Did Shmuel really say that a creditor pays for improvements made by one who bought from the borrower?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Shmuel):</span> A creditor collects (and keeps) the improvements (that the buyer made).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The creditor pays the buyer for produce that has grown fully and is ready to be harvested.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He pays for improvements that can later be taken from the field (i.e. produce that is not fully ripe).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (R. Tam) Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He pays for improvements that came through toil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> In many cases Shmuel ruled that the creditor gets such improvements without paying!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He pays only when the value of the improved land is more than he was owed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Shmuel is only like the opinion that even if the buyer has money, he cannot pay the loan and keep the land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that if the buyer has money, he can pay the loan and keep the land, the buyer should be able to say 'consider the money you must pay for the improvements as partial payment of the loan, and leave me that amount of land!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, the borrower made the land an Aputiki, i.e. the debt will be collected only from the land (not from money).</p>
