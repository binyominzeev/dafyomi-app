<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 45 (17 Shevat) - Dedicated by Mrs. Idelle Rudman in memory of Harav Reuven Moshe Rudman ben Harav Yosef Tuvia Rudman on his third Yahrzeit. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>AN OX SENTENCED TO BE STONED (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven's ox killed, before the final verdict, if he sold it, it is sold. If he made it Hekdesh, it is Hekdesh. If he slaughtered it, the meat is permitted. If the Shomer returned it to Reuven's house, it is considered returned;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>After the verdict (if these were done), it is not sold, it is not Hekdesh, the meat is forbidden; and it is not considered returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yakov says, if the Shomer returned it, it is considered returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim say that a Shomer cannot return something deposited by him after it became Asur b'Hana'ah (forbidden to benefit from it. Rather, he must pay). R. Yakov says that he can return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rabah):</span> All agree that a Shomer can return something that became Asur b'Hana'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If they argued about this, Chachamim would not allow returning Chametz after Pesach (but we know that they do).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> If they argue about this, the argument (here) should have been taught regarding Chametz on Pesach (lest we think that they argue about something else).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rather, they argue about whether or not Beis Din can sentence an ox in its absence.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say they cannot. Reuven can say, you caused me to lose my ox. Had you returned it to me, I would have hid it, it would not have been sentenced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yakov says, an ox can be sentenced in its absence. In any case, it would have been sentenced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From where do Chachamim learn?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "The ox will be stoned, and also the owner will die" - execution of an ox is like execution of the owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like we sentence a man only when he is present, also regarding an ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yakov says, this applies only to a man, who can make claims. It is unreasonable to learn this regarding an ox!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE RESPONSIBILITY OF <i>SHOMRIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one gave an animal to a Shomer Chinam, borrower,...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Four Shomrim are in place of the owner: a Shomer Chinam, a borrower, a Shomer Sachar, and a renter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the animal is Tam and it kills, it is killed, and Kofer is not paid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the animal is Mu'ad and if it kills, it is killed, and Kofer is paid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Shomer must compensate the owner for the loss of his ox, except for a Shomer Chinam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he guarded the ox, no Shomer should be liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he did not guard the ox, even a Shomer Chinam should be liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he guarded it poorly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is enough for a Shomer Chinam, but not for other Shomrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is R. Meir, who says that a renter is like a Shomer Chinam.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, also a renter should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is like R. Yehudah, who says that a renter is like a Shomer Sachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, all should be exempt from Kofer regarding a Mu'ad (he holds that a poor guarding suffices for a Mu'ad)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna bar Chinena):</span> The Beraisa is R. Elazar, who says that a Mu'ad cannot be guarded, and it must be killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding a renter, he holds like R. Yehudah, that he is like a Shomer Sachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Really he holds like R. Meir, according to Rabah bar Avuha, who switches their opinions.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Avuha):</span> R. Meir says that a renter is like a Shomer Sachar, and R. Yehudah says that he is like a Shomer Chinam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If Reuven handed his ox over to a Shomer Chinam, and it damaged, the Shomer is liable. If it was damaged, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he accepted to guard it, he should be liable even if it is damaged!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he did not accept to guard it, he should be exempt even if it damaged!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Really, he accepted to guard it. The case is, he knew that it was a gorer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He expected to have to guard it from damaging. He did not expect to have to guard it from being damaged (since animals fear it)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW WELL MUST ONE GUARD AN ANIMAL?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven tied his animal by the rope around its neck, or locked (a gate) in front of it properly, and it escaped and damaged, he is liable, whether it is Tam or Mu'ad;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, a Tam is liable, and a Mu'ad is exempt. It says "if he will not guard it", and this is guarded!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Elazar says, a Mu'ad cannot be guarded. It must be killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that people normally do not guard their oxen. The Torah obligates a Tam to pay; this mandates a minimal guarding. It says about a Mu'ad "if he will not guard it", that it must be guarded well. We learn a Tam (from a Gezeirah Shavah "Yigach-Yigach") from a Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah holds that people normally guard their oxen (minimally). The Torah obligates a Tam to pay; this mandates a proper guarding. It says about a Mu'ad "if he will not guard it." This is a second verse coming to include the same thing (that it must be guarded well), so it really comes to exclude. I.e., a poor guarding suffices for a Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn a Tam from a Mu'ad, through the Gezeirah Shavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says about a Mu'ad "if he will not guard it" - a minimal guarding is not enough for anything else.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need the verse to obligate one who did not guard!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said only "if he will not guard." "It" is extra, to teach that a minimal guarding suffices only for a Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> A minimal guarding suffices for both Tam and Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does he learn?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns that a minimal guarding suffices for a Mu'ad, like R. Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He learns Tam from Mu'ad from the Gezeirah Shavah, like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> R. Yehudah holds that a minimal guarding exempts only the additional payment of a Mu'ad. It does not exempt half-damage that a Tam pays.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> An ox Mu'ad to gore with the right horn is not Mu'ad to gore with the left horn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Rav need not teach about paying half or full damage. We can learn this from a Mishnah, which says that Mu'ad for animals is not Mu'ad for people!) Surely, he came to teach about how well it must be guarded.) Like whom does Rav hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot hold like R. Meir. R. Meir requires a proper guarding for both Tam and Mu'ad!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he holds like R. Yehudah, even the right horn has both a Tam and Mu'ad side (so he could have taught about the levels of guarding the right horn alone)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he holds like R. Yehudah. Rav disagrees with Rav Ada bar Ahavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav holds that only in this case R. Yehudah holds that a Mu'ad has a Tam side.</p>
