<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>COLLISIONS IN THE <i>RESHUS</i> <i>HA'RABIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If Shimon stopped, he must pay. If he told Reuven 'stop!', he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Shimon was walking in back of Reuven, and the beam broke the jug, Shimon must pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven stopped, Shimon is exempt. If he told Shimon 'stop!', Shimon must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The same applies if Reuven was carrying a lit lamp, and Shimon was carrying flax (and it caught fire).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rabah bar Nasan) Question:</span> If one damaged his wife through Bi'ah (marital relations), must he pay?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he may have Bi'ah with her, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he should have been more careful, and he must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> We learn from (the Reisha of) our Mishnah. Since each has permission to walk, the damager is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> A Kal va'Chomer shows that he must pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Everyone may enter a forest, yet if one accidentally kills someone while chopping wood, it is as if he entered the victim's domain, and he is exiled;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A man enters his wife's body during Bi'ah. All the more so, he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> (He is exempt, because) each of them is entitled to walk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the Mishnah, both men participated in the damage. In Bi'ah, he acts, and she is passive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "They (who transgress Arayos, i.e. forbidden relations) will get Kares (excision), the souls that do" shows that both do an action!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both are punished because both enjoy the act; but only he does an action.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon (the one holding the beam) was first...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If a cow was crouching in a Reshus ha'Rabim, and another cow was walking and it kicked the crouching cow it is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the crouching cow kicked the walking cow, it is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah supports Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon was in front, and the jug broke on the beam, Shimon is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Shimon stopped, he must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is like a crouching cow kicking a walking cow, and the damager must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That part of Reish Lakish's law is obvious. The Mishnah opposes what may be inferred from Reish Lakish!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reish Lakish obligated the crouching cow when it kicked. Had it passively damaged, it would be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the Mishnah, Shimon is liable for passive damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the Mishnah, Shimon's beam blocked the entire road, making it impossible for Reuven to pass;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding the cows, there was room to walk to the side of the crouching cow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rather, the Reisha supports Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon was walking in back of Reuven, and the beam broke the jug, Shimon must pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Reuven stopped, Shimon is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like the walking cow damaging the crouching cow, and the Mishnah says, he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> In the Mishnah, Shimon walked normally. In Reish Lakish's case, the walking cow should not have kicked.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>COLLISIONS IN THE <i>RESHUS</i> <i>HA'RABIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was running in a Reshus ha'Rabim and Shimon was walking, or both were running, and they damaged each other, they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Our Mishnah is unlike Isi ben Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Isi ben Yehudah):</span> The one running is liable, for this is abnormal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Isi admits that Erev Shabbos, Bein ha'Shemashos (the beginning of Shabbos), he is exempt, for he is allowed to run.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows Isi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan holds that the Halachah follows a Stam (anonymous) Mishnah. Our Mishnah is unlike Isi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah is like Isi. It discusses Bein ha'Shemashos of Erev Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to say so?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha says if both were running, they are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this needed? Even if one runs and the other walks, he is exempt. All the more so, if both are running they are exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Mishnah teaches that if Reuven was running and Shimon was walking, Reuven is exempt. This refers to Erev Shabbos, Bein ha'Shemashos. At any other time, Reuven is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If both were running, even during the week they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Isi admits that Erev Shabbos, Bein ha'Shemashos (the beginning of Shabbos), he is exempt, for he is allowed to run.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he allowed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like R. Chanina;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On Erev Shabbos, Bein ha'Shemashos, R. Chanina would say 'come, let us go out to greet the bride, the queen.'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Some say that he explicitly said '... to greet Shabbos, the bride, the queen.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yanai would cloak himself, stand and say 'come bride, come bride'.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DAMAGE IN A DIFFERENT DOMAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man was chopping wood in a Reshus ha'Rabim and damaged in a Reshus ha'Yachid, or vice- versa, or was chopping in a Reshus ha'Yachid and damaged in a different Reshus ha'Yachid, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Mishnah must teach all three cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only when he was in a Reshus ha'Yachid and damaged in a Reshus ha'Rabim, one might have thought only there he is liable, for many people frequent the Reshus ha'Rabim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only when he was in a Reshus ha'Rabim and damaged in a Reshus ha'Yachid, one might have thought that only there he is liable, for he was not allowed to chop there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had it taught only these cases, one might have thought that they are liable because in one case many people frequent there Reshus ha'Rabim, and in the other case he was not allowed to chop there, but from a Reshus ha'Yachid to a Reshus ha'Yachid, he would be exempt. The Seifa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>EXILE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man entered Reuven's carpentry shop without permission, and a piece of wood flew off and killed him, Reuven is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he had permission to enter, Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> What is his liability?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> He is liable in the four payments, and exempt from exile, for this does not resemble a forest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In a forest, each enters his own domain. Here, the victim entered Reuven's domain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> In a forest, (the victim did not ask permission, yet) we consider it as if he had the damager's permission to enter. Here, where he had explicit permission, all the more so Reuven should be exiled!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He is exempt from exile, i.e. he does not merit refuge (the Go'el ha'Dam can kill him anywhere).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi bar Chanina taught that he is not exiled because he is Shogeg close to Mezid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If the Shali'ach of Beis Din (to lash people) gave an extra lash and killed the person, he is exiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is close to Mezid, for he should realize that an extra lash can kill someone!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Simi of Nehardai):</span> The case is, he erred in the count.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> The one who whips does not count!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The greatest of the judges reads (the verses), the second counts, and the third says 'strike him'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Simi of Nehardai):</span> Rather, the judge erred in the count.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven threw a stone to a Reshus ha'Rabim and killed someone, he is exiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is close to Mezid, for he should realize that many people are in a Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak):</span> The case is, Reuven was destroying his wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should look (that no one is coming)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He was destroying it at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even at night, he should look!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He was destroying it during the day into a waste-heap.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What sort of waste-heap is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If people frequent it, he is (close to) Mezid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If people don't frequent it, he is (close to) Ones!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> People normally frequent it at night. Occasionally they frequent it by day.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>ONE WHO ENTERED THE <i>RESHUS</i> IN WHICH HE WAS DAMAGED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Papa citing Rava (Beraisa):</span> If a man entered Reuven's carpentry shop without permission, and a piece of wood flew off and killed him, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> He is exempt from exile, but is liable to pay four payments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Version #1 exempts from exile even when the victim had permission to enter. All the more so, it exempts when the victim had no permission!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Version #2 exempts from exile when the victim had no permission to enter. If he had permission, Reuven would be exiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a man entered a smith's shop, and a spark flew off and killed him, the smith is exempt, even if the victim entered with permission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa discusses an apprentice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are apprentices destined to be killed?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The teacher was asking him to leave, and he refused.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is he destined to be killed because he refused to leave?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The teacher thought that he had left.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even if he was not an apprentice, the smith is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Other people do not fear the smith, so he should check that they left. An apprentice fears the smith, so he could assume that he left.</p>
