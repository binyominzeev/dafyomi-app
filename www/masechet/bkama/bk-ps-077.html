<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SOMETHING FITTING TO BE REDEEMED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Likewise, he holds that anything fitting to be redeemed, it is considered as if it was redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> A red heifer receives Tum'ah like a food because there was a time when it was ready to be eaten.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">77b----------------------------------------77b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> R. Shimon holds that a red heifer may be redeemed even (after slaughter) near the wood (when it is about to be burned).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It receives Tum'ah even though it was never actually permitted to eat, but it was ready to be eaten had it been redeemed. Since it could have been redeemed, we consider it as if it was redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DIFFERENT ANSWERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Yochanan (bottom of 76a) did not answer as Reish Lakish, for he wanted to establish the Mishnah to discuss even Tam animals;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Reish Lakish answer like R. Yochanan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "And he slaughtered it or sold it" - a thief is liable (four or five) for slaughtering only if he would have been liable for selling.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since Tam Kodshim cannot be sold, a thief is not liable for slaughtering them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish are consistent with what they taught elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Shimon obligates a thief who sells a Tereifah. Even though he would be exempt for slaughtering it (since this does not permit the meat), he is liable for selling it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> R. Shimon exempts him. Since he would be exempt for slaughtering it, he is exempt for selling it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> If a thief stole Kilayim (a crossbreed) and slaughtered it, or a Tereifah and sold it, he pays four or five.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like R. Shimon. Even though he would be exempt for slaughtering it, he is liable for selling it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> No, it is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim (who obligate for slaughter even if the meat is not permitted) obligate even for slaughtering a Tereifah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> (Even) if you will say it is R. Shimon, he should be liable for selling Kilayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that the Tana mentioned slaughtering Kilayim, but the same applies to selling it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also regarding a Tereifah, Chachamim mentioned selling it, but the same applies to slaughtering it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yochanan):</span> We understand if the Mishnah is like R. Shimon. Since the Tana could teach only one thing (selling) about a Tereifah, he also taught only one (slaughter) about Kilayim (even though both apply);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Mishnah were like Chachamim, they should be taught together. For slaughtering or selling a Tereifah or Kilayim, he pays four or five!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is left difficult (for Reish Lakish).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>KILAYIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he pay four or five for Kilayim? The Torah said "Seh" (a sheep or goat);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Wherever the Torah says "Seh", this excludes Kilayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "ox or Seh" to include Kilayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that 'or' always comes to include?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "An ox or lamb" excludes Kilayim; "or goat" excludes a Nidmeh (an animal that does not resemble its parents, i.e. a child of two sheep that looks like a goat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> 'Or' changes what we would have otherwise understood from the verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding theft, it says "ox or Seh." Mating them cannot produce Kilayim (nothing will be born), so one would have thought that four or five does not apply to Kilayim. 'Or' teaches that it does apply;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding Kodshim, it says "lamb or goat." Mating them can produce Kilayim, so one would have thought that Kilayim are valid Korbanos - 'or' teaches that they are not.</p>
