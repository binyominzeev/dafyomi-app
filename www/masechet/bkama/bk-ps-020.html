<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA KAMA 20 (14 Sivan) - Dedicated by Doug Rabin in memory of his mother, Leah Miriam bat Yisroel (Lucy) Rabin, in honor of her Yahrzeit. <br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 18-20 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the ninth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FOOD FIT FOR ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A case occurred in which a goat saw food on the mouth of a barrel, climbed up, ate the food and broke the barrel. Rava obligated full damage for both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Since it is normal to eat the food, it is normal to climb (and break the barrel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Ilfa):</span> If an animal in Reshus ha'Rabim extended its neck and ate from a load on another animal, it is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The back of another animal is like the victim's premises.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Ilfa - Beraisa):</span> If a box was hanging in back of an animal, and another animal stretched its neck and ate from it, it is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (like Rava said elsewhere):</span> The case is, it jumped to eat (this is Keren, it pays half-damage even in a Reshus ha'Rabim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshiya):</span> If an animal walked and ate in a Reshus ha'Rabim, it is exempt. If it stopped and ate, it is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Both of these are normal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer: (Rava):</span> The case (of standing) is, it jumped to eat (this is Keren).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If the food was rolling, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An animal was rolling food from a Reshus ha'Yachid to a Reshus ha'Rabim (or vice-versa. Does the law depend on where it ate, or from where it took the food?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may learn from R. Chiya:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> There was food in a sack. Part of the food was outside the sack. If an animal eats the food inside (this is like the victim's domain), it is liable. If it eats it outside (the Reshus ha'Rabim), it is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The animal pushed the food inside or took it out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No. R. Chiya obligates for what it eats inside, and exempts for what it eats outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> R. Chiya discusses long stalks of fodder that stick out of the bag (while the animal eats, the food is pulled to where its mouth is. Surely, this depends on where the animal is.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Food was rolling from the victim's domain towards the Reshus ha'Rabim. (The animal ate it as it was about to enter the Reshus ha'Rabim. Do we consider the food as if it were in the Reshus ha'Rabim?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may learn from R. Chiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> There was food in a sack. Part of the food was outside the sack. If an animal eats the food inside, it is liable. If it eats it outside, it is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The food would have fallen out by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No. R. Chiya obligates for what would have stayed inside, and exempts for what would have fallen out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> No, R. Chiya discusses long stalks of fodder that stretch outside the sack (that would not have fallen out. One might have thought that it depends on where the majority of each stalk is.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it ate clothing...(in a Reshus ha'Rabim, it is exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which case does this apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav and Reish Lakish (below)):</span> It applies to all cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one party does something abnormal, and another party acts abnormally and damages the first, the second party is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel and R. Yochanan):</span> The exemption is for fruits and vegetables, but not for clothing and Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Reish Lakish is consistent with what he said elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If a cow was crouching in a Reshus ha'Rabim, and another cow was walking, and it kicked the crouching cow, it is exempt (for the latter acted abnormally first);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the crouching cow kicked the walking cow, it is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yochanan argues with this teaching of Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he agrees regarding cows (for it is abnormal to crouch);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He argues about clothing, for it is common to leave clothing in a Reshus ha'Rabim while resting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it benefited, it pays the benefit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> It is the price of hay (that the animal would have eaten instead).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It is the price of barley, when it is cheap (two thirds of the usual price).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>One Beraisa supports Rabah, and one supports Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> It pays only the price of hay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If it benefited, it pays the benefit.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it ate one or two Kavim (of barley), it does not pay the full price. Rather, we evaluate how much one would spend to feed his animal something better than usual.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Therefore, if it ate wheat, or anything else bad for it, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BENEFITING WITHOUT CAUSING A LOSS TO ANOTHER PERSON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> Reuven lived in Shimon's yard without Shimon's knowledge, must he pay rent?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the yard is not normally rented, and Reuven does not normally rent a place (he has where to stay for free), Reuven didn't benefit, and Shimon didn't lose (surely, Reuven is exempt)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If the yard is normally rented, and Reuven normally rents a place, Reuven benefited and  Shimon lost (obviously, Reuven must pay)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The yard is not normally rented, and Reuven normally rents a place.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Can Reuven claim 'you didn't lose due to me!'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, can Shimon say 'you benefited (and must pay me)!'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> A Mishnah settles that question!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Which Mishnah settles it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rami bar Chama asked Rav Chisda to serve him before answering. Rav Chisda folded Rami bar Chama's turban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rami bar Chama:</span> 'If it benefits, it pays the benefit.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> One whom Hash-m helps is saved from ailments and ! The answer is not proper, yet Rav Chisda accepted it!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In our Mishnah, the damager benefits, and the owner of the food loses. Rav Chisda asked about when Reuven benefits and Shimon does not lose!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rami bar Chama assumes that one who left Peros in a Reshus ha'Rabim was Mafkir them (so also he does not lose).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven's property surrounds Shimon's property on three sides, and Reuven built a wall between them (Rashi; Tosfos - on the outer border of his own property) on one side, then the second, then the third - Shimon need not share the cost;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> If he surrounded him on all four sides, Shimon would need to share the cost!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> When Shimon benefits from Reuven, he must pay, even if Reuven does not lose (Reuven needed to build on all sides anyway)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, Reuven loses. Reuven needed to build only because Shimon is in the middle! (Rashi; Tosfos - Reuven's outer perimeter is larger, and he needed to build more because Shimon's property is in the middle).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> If Shimon built a wall himself enclosing his fourth side, he must share the expense of the first three walls.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> This is only because Shimon did this himself. Had Reuven done it, Shimon would be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> When Shimon benefits from Reuven, and Reuven does not lose, Shimon is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shimon does not benefit. He can say that he does not need strong walls, and cheap thorns would have sufficed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Mishnah):</span> If a two-story house fell, and Shimon (who owns the upper story) wants to rebuild it but Reuven (who owns the ground floor) refuses, Shimon may build it and live there. Reuven may not live there until he pays Shimon's expenses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> Reuven does not deduct the benefit Shimon had from living there in the meantime, even though Shimon benefited.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> When Shimon benefits from Reuven, and Reuven does not lose, Shimon is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There is different, for the owner of the ground floor is obligated to provide a basis for the upper story.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Seifa - R. Yehudah):</span> Even in this case, one who lives in another's yard without his knowledge must pay rent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> When Shimon benefits from Reuven, and Reuven does not lose, Shimon must pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, Reuven loses. One who lives in a new house blackens the walls.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE FINAL RULING ON THE ABOVE QUESTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Bei R. Ami):</span> Since Reuven caused no loss to Shimon, surely he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chiya bar Aba was repeatedly asked; he never reached a conclusion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #7 (Rav Kahana citing R. Yochanan):</span> He need not pay rent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #8 (R. Avahu citing R. Yochanan):</span> He must pay rent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> R. Avahu did not hear that explicitly, he inferred it from something R. Yochanan said.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven (the treasurer of Hekdesh) took a rock or beam of Hekdesh. he did not transgress Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he gave it to someone else, Reuven transgressed Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Reuven (kept it and) used it to build his house, he does not transgress Me'ilah until he gets a Perutah's worth of benefit from it by living in the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It was not fixed into the house. Rather, it was placed on top of an opening in the ceiling.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Avahu said in front of R. Yochanan:</span> We learn from Shmuel that when Shimon benefits from Reuven, and Reuven does not lose, Shimon must pay! R. Yochanan was silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Avahu assumed that his silence indicated agreement. Really, R. Yochanan paid no attention, for he holds like Rabah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Matters of Hekdesh without awareness are like a commoner's dealings with awareness (since Hash-m is aware. Therefore, benefit without the owner's awareness does not apply).</p>
