<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SENDING A FIRE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (If Yehudah came and blew the flame...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Both "Libah" and "Nivah (blew)" are reasonable texts of the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the wind fanned the flame, all are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Yehudah blew and the wind fanned the flame, if Yehudah's blowing was enough, he is liable. If not, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this? This should be like one who winnows with the wind (one is liable for this on Shabbos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The case is, Yehudah blew from one side, and the wind from the other (so Yehudah did not assist the wind).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> When Yehudah was blowing, a normal wind was blowing. Later, an abnormal wind spread the flame.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Zeira):</span> He did not really blow, he just exhaled like one warming his hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> One who winnows with the wind is liable only regarding Shabbos, in which the Torah forbids intended labor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, the blower only helped cause damage. Causation of damage is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LIABILITY FOR A FIRE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sent a fire, and it consumed wood, stones or dirt, he is liable - "when a fire will go and find thorns, and consume a stack, Kamah (standing crop) or the field, the one who burned will pay."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava) Question:</span> Why did the Torah need to write "thorns", "a stack", "Kamah" and "the field"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it written only "thorns", one might have thought that one is liable only for thorns, since they are used for fires and people are not careful with them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it written only "a stack", one might have thought that one is liable only for a stack, for this is a big loss, but not for thorns.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We need "Kamah" to teach that one is liable only for exposed things.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah obligates fire even for concealed things. What does he learn from "Kamah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This includes everything of stature (trees and animals).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Chachamim learn this from "or the Kamah."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>R. Yehudah says, we need "or" to know that one liable for burning even one of these!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>Chachamim learn that from "or" written before "field".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span>R. Yehudah says, since it needed to write "or" once, it was repeated for parallel structure.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We need "the field" to obligate for scorching a plowed field or rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah could have written only "the field", and we would know that all the more so one is liable for thorns, stacks and Kamah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That would not have sufficed. Had it written only "the field", one might have thought one is liable only for what is in the field (but not for the ground itself).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT TO DO AT TIMES OF PUNISHMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Punishments come to the world only when the wicked are in the world. The punishments start with the Tzadikim - "when a fire will go and find thorns" - the fire erupts when there are thorns (Resha'im);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn that it starts with the Tzadikim from "and a stack (Tzadik) was consumed", not "and it will consume a stack" - it was already consumed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> "No one may leave his house until morning (on the night of Makos Bechoros)" - once permission to destroy is given (to the angel of death), he does not distinguish between Tzadikim and Resha'im (i.e. e kills both);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Further, he begins with the Tzadikim - "I will cut off from you Tzadik and Rasha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> What does the Tzadik's righteousness help him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> It is good that he (dies first and) doesn't see the destruction - "before the evil, the Tzadik dies".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One should always start traveling and end traveling when the sun is out - "no one may leave his house until morning."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When pestilence is in the city, stay inside. It says "no one may leave his house until morning"; also, "go my nation, in your room, close the door in back of you"; also, "the sword (of the angel of death) will kill outside, and inside, fear."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why were all three verses needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the first verse, we would not know (that one must stay inside at a time of pestilence) during the day;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From the second verse, we would not know to stay inside even when there is fear inside. Perhaps it is better to be with people outside!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rava would shut the windows when there was pestilence - "for death has come in our windows."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If there is famine in the city, leave - "there was a famine in the land, and Avram descended to Mitzrayim to sojourn there." Also, "if we will go to the city, and there is famine in the city, we will die there".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was the second verse needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first verse does not teach about when there is possible mortal danger outside the city;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn this from the continuation of the second verse, "let us come...(and if we will die, we will die)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If there is pestilence in the city, one should not walk in the middle of the street, for the angel of death goes there. Since he has permission to kill, he goes openly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there is peace in the city, one should not walk on the sides of the street, for the Angel of death goes there. Since he has no permission, he goes covertly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If there is pestilence in the city, one should not go alone to the Beis ha'Keneses, for the angel of death leaves his Kelim there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only when children do not learn there, and 10 men do not pray there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If dogs cry, this shows that the angel of death is in the city. If they laugh, this shows that Eliyahu has come;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This does not apply if a female dog is there.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>KING DAVID'S QUESTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> "When a fire will go and find thorns, and a stack is consumed or Kamah or the field, the one who burned will pay" - Hash-m said 'I must pay for burning the Mikdash. I will rebuild it with fire - "I will be like a wall of fire around (Yerushalayim)"';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse initially discusses damage of a man's property ("when a fire will go" - by itself) and concludes with a man's damage ("the one who burned"). This teaches that one is liable for fire like for his arrows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "David desired and said 'who will give me water (Torah) to drink from the well of Beis Lechem in the gate (the Sanhedrin)?' Three mighty ones... (drew the water and gave it to David, but he did not want to drink it)." What did David want to know?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> He wanted to know whether fire is exempt for something concealed in a fire (like Chachamim, or if one is liable, like R. Yehudah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna):</span> Pelishtim were hiding in stacks of barley of Yisrael. He wanted to know if may use others' money (burn the stacks) to save himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The answer was that a commoner may not, but a king may break down walls to make a path for himself, and no one may protest (and all the more so, here he is permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rabanan):</span> There were stacks of barley of Yisrael, and stacks of lentils of Pelishtim. He wanted to know if he may feed his animal from the barley, on condition that he will pay with lentils;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The answer was "the security he will return, a Rasha will return the theft" (i.e. (a commoner) who steals and pays back is called a Rasha), but a king may break down walls to make a path for himself, and no one may protest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rabanan, we can resolve the verses "there was a field full of lentils", "There was a field full of barley";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rav Huna, why do the verses differ?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There were also stacks of lentils, in which Pelishtim were hiding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Huna, we understand "he stood in the field and saved it" (from being burned).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the Rabanan, what was saved?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They did not take the barley on condition to repay lentils.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rava, how do we understand the verses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> David asked whether fire is liable for concealed things, and also the question of Rav Huna or Rabanan.</p>
