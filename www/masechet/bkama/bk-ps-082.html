<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ANOTHER ENACTMENT OF YEHOSHUA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ravin said that R. Yochanan taught that if the foliage of Reuven's tree extends into Shimon's field, or if Reuven's tree is planted on the border of Shimon's field, Reuven may bring Bikurim and recite ("...the land that You (Hash-m) gave to me...", even though it did not (fully) grow in Reuven's land). Yehoshua made the inheritance of Eretz Yisrael conditional on this enactment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the teaching about Yehoshua's 10 enactments is not a Beraisa, rather, a teaching of R. Yehoshua ben Levi. R. Yochanan argues with R. Yehoshua ben Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Gaviha recited this teaching in R. Yehoshua ben Levi's name.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EZRA'S ENACTMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Ezra made 10 enactments:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We read the Torah at Minchah on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We read the Torah on Mondays and Thursdays;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Beis Din sits to judge on Mondays and Thursdays;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One should launder clothes on Thursday;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>We eat garlic on Shabbos night;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>A woman should rise early on Erev Shabbos and bake (bread);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>A woman should wear a Sinar (underpants);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>A woman should wash her hair before immersing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>(Perfume) peddlers should go around in cities;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>One who had an emission of seed must immerse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We read the Torah at Minchah on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is for the sake of idle people who do not come to hear it on Mondays and Thursdays.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We read the Torah on Mondays and Thursdays.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This was enacted before Ezra (in the days of Moshe)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "They traveled three days in the wilderness, and did not find water" - expounders say that this refers to Torah - "all who are thirsty should come to water."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Because they went three days without Torah, they wearied. Prophets among them enacted to read the Torah on Shabbos, Mondays and Thursdays, so there would never be three days without Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> At first, they enacted that one man read three verses, or alternatively, that three men will read one verse each;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Three corresponds to Kohanim, Leviyim and Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ezra enacted that three men should read 10 verses, corresponding to the 10 men who have no job and are always in Beis ha'Keneses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Beis Din sits to judge on Mondays and Thursdays.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because people come to the city on those days to hear the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>One should launder clothes on Thursday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is to honor Shabbos (so he will have freshly laundered clothing for Shabbos. Nevertheless, one should not launder on Friday, lest he not have enough time to prepare the other needs of Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>We eat garlic on Shabbos night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because (garlic increases semen, and) Shabbos is the ideal time for Bi'ah - "(Hash-m) will give its fruit in its time";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The verse discusses one who has Bi'ah only on Shabbos nights.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Garlic does five things: it satiates, it warms a person, it makes his countenance radiant, it increases a man's seed, and it kills intestinal lice.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Some say, it also increases love and dispels envy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A woman should rise early on Erev Shabbos and bake (bread).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is so bread will be available for the poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>A woman should wear a Sinar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is a safeguard from immorality.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>A woman should wash her hair before immersing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah requires this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"He will wash Es Besaro (his flesh) in water" - nothing should separate between his flesh and the water;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Es Besaro" includes what is secondary to his flesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mid'Oraisa, it suffices to look if any hairs are tied, or if anything is in the hair;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">82b----------------------------------------82b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ezra enacted that she must wash it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Peddlers should go around in cities.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is so that perfume will be available to women, lest they become repulsive to their husbands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>One who had an emission of seed must immerse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"A man who will have an emission of seed... will wash his flesh in water."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah obligates him to immerse before eating Terumah or Kodshim. Ezra obligated him to immerse before Talmud Torah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE UNIQUENESS OF YERUSHALAYIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Ten things are special about Yerushalayim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one sells a house in Yerushalayim, he may redeem it whenever he wants (if he does not, it returns to him in Yovel);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Yerushalayim does not behead a calf (even if it is the closest city to a murdered corpse);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It cannot become an Ir ha'Nidachas (normally, if the majority of its residents of a city were convicted for serving idolatry, we burn the entire city );</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Houses in Yerushalayim do not become Tamei through Tzara'as;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>We may not have beams or balconies sticking out of houses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>We do not make waste-heaps in the city;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>We do not have furnaces (to make pottery) in the city;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>We do not have gardens or orchards in the city, except for the rose gardens (which were needed for the incense) from the days of the first prophets;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>We do not raise chickens in the city;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>We do not leave a corpse overnight in the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sells a house in Yerushalayim, he may redeem it whenever he wants.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Normally, one may not redeem a house in a walled city after one year, like it says "the house in the walled city will remain the buyer's forever, for his generations." However, the Tana of this Beraisa holds that Yerushalayim was not divided among the tribes. Any city that was not divided among the tribes returns to its original owner in Yovel, whether or not it has a wall. (It is likewise excluded from any law regarding which the Torah discusses 'your land' or 'your inheritance.')</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yerushalayim does not behead a calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "if you will find a corpse in the land that Hash-m gives it you for an inheritance."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It cannot become an Ir ha'Nidachas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "(If people will serve idolatry in one of) your cities".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Houses in Yerushalayim do not become Tamei through Tzara'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It says "...Tzara'as in a house of the land of your inheritance".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may not have beams or balconies sticking out of houses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Such protrusions can impart Tum'ah (if one is under them at the same time as Tum'as Mes is under them); also, people coming for the festival may get hurt on them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not make waste-heaps in the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sheratzim (rodents) breed in waste-heaps (Sheratzim spread Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not have furnaces (to make pottery) in the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They make smoke, which would blacken the city wall. That would be a disgrace.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not have gardens or orchards in the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because people cast out weeds. Also, they fertilize them with rotting manure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not raise chickens in the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They can cause Tum'ah to Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not leave a corpse overnight in the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We have a tradition for this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>RAISING PIGS AND <i>CHOCHMAS</i> <i>YEVANIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>We may not raise pigs anywhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When the Chashmonai kings were fighting each other, Hurkenus was inside Yerushalayim, and Aristobulus was besieging it from outside. Every day, those inside lowered a basket of coins over the wall, and those outside gave them lambs for the Tamid (daily Korban), which were lifted over the wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An elder told the besiegers, in the language of Chochmas Yevanis, that they will not conquer it as long as the Korbanos are brought. The next day, the besiegers gave a pig instead of lambs. When the pig was halfway up, it stuck its claws into the wall. All of Eretz Yisrael shook 400 Parsah  by 400 Parsah (about 1600 kilometers).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim imposed a curse on anyone who will raise pigs or teach his son Chochmas Yevanis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding that period we learned that the Omer offering was brought from barley from the Gagos Tzrifin (a place far from Yerushalayim, because the grain nearby was destroyed) and the two loaves brought on Shavuos were brought from wheat of Ein Socher.</p>
