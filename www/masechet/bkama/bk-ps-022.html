<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 21-25 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the ninth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHY ONE PAYS FOR DAMAGE CAUSED BY FIRE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a dog took (a cake with a coal... and burned the grain...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One is liable for fire like for an arrow that he shot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He is liable because it is his property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Reish Lakish say like R. Yochanan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One gives impetus to arrows, but not to fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Yochanan say like Reish Lakish?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Property has substance, but fire has no substance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a dog took... it pays half-damage for the grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This is like the opinion that he is liable like for arrows. This is the dog's arrow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that it is his property, the coal is not the property of the dog's owner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the dog threw the coal. It pays full damage for the cake, half-damage for where the coal was thrown (this is pebbles; some explain, it is Keren, for this is unusual), and it is exempt for the rest of the grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan explains that the dog placed the coal down. It pays full damage for the cake (Shen) and for where the coal was placed (fire), and half- damage for the rest (pebbles).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a camel laden with flax was walking in a Reshus ha'Rabim, and the flax entered a store, caught fire from the store-owner's lamp, and burned the building, the camel's owner is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the storeowner left his lamp outside, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, if it was lit for the Mitzvah of Ner Chanukah, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is like the opinion that one is liable for fire like for arrows. This is the camel's arrow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>According to the opinion that it is his property, the lamp is not the property of the camel's owner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the camel brushed the burning flax against the entire building. (The argument about why one is liable for fire refers to damage due to spreading of the fire.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reisha):</span> If the storeowner left his lamp outside, he is liable. 1.  If the camel brushed the burning flax against the entire building, why is the storeowner liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The load of flax was so big that the camel rubbed the burning flax against the entire building while standing still.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> All the more so, the camel's owner should be liable (for not leading his camel away)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna bar Mano'ach):</span> The camel stopped to urinate;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the flax entered the shop and caught fire, the camel's owner was at fault for overloading the camel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the lamp was outside, the storeowner was at fault.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EXEMPTIONS FROM DAMAGE CAUSED BY FIRE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven lit a stack of grain and there was a goat tied to it and a slave nearby, and they burned, Reuven is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If there was a slave tied to it and a goat nearby, and they burned, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that one is liable for fire like for arrows (he does not pay money, because he is Chayav Misah (worthy to die) for killing the slave);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that one is liable for fire like for his property, why is he exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This should be like when his ox gores a slave (Rashi - he must pay 30 Shekalim for the slave; Tosfos - he must pay for other damage done at the same time)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he directly burned the slave. Because he is Chayav Misah for killing the slave, he does not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, obviously he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is, even thought the goat and slave belong to different people, he is exempt for both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sent a flame with (Shimon,) a deaf-mute, lunatic or child, Beis Din cannot force Reuven to pay, but he is liable b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like the opinion that fire is liable like for arrows. Reuven need not pay for Shimon's arrows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to the opinion that it is his property, he should be liable, just like if he asked Shimon to guard his ox (and the ox damaged)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> Reuven is exempt only if he gave to Shimon a coal, and Shimon blew on it (and it flared up);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he gave a flame, Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is because it is a clear damager.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yochanan exempts Reuven even if he gave a flame. Shimon caused the damage by the way he held the flame.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Reuven is liable only for gross negligence, i.e. he gave dry wood, (small) kindling wood and a (lit) lamp.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A verse and a Beraisa support R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"When fire will go out" connotes by itself. "The one who burned will pay" (he is called one who burned).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Torah first mentioned money that damages, and concludes with one who damages. This teaches that fire is liable because it is like his arrows.</p>
