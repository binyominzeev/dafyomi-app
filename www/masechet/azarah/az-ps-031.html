<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN ARE WE CONCERNED FOR NOCHRIM TOUCHING?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> There are three laws of wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Wine that was offered to idolatry - one may not benefit from it, and a k'Zayis of it is Metamei (even people and Kelim, if they touch or move it (Rambam; Rashi - even if they are in the same Ohel with it));</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Wine of Nochrim (perhaps it was offered to idolatry) - one may not benefit from it, and a Revi'is of it can receive Tum'ah like a liquid (Rashi; Tosfos - a Revi'is is Tamei);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Reuven deposited wine with a Nochri - one may not drink (what he takes back), but one may benefit from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven deposited Peros with a Nochri, (we are concerned lest the Nochri switched it with his own Peros), Reuven must consider them (Safek) like the Nochri's Peros regarding Ma'aseros and Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav Asi's law applies when they specified a corner in which the wine will be kept (Rashi - and Reuven received the key to that area, or the container was sealed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it would be permitted to drink it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When R. Yochanan went to Parod, he asked if anyone knew teachings of Bar Kapara.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum citing Bar Kapara):</span> If one deposits wine with a Nochri, he may drink it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> How do we understand "Mekom she'Yipol ha'Etz Sham Yehu"? After a Tzadik dies, he is not there!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Rather, after he dies, the people of his area perpetuate his teachings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Rav Asi's law is like Chachamim, and the Mishnah is like R. Eliezer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If Reuven bought or rented a house in a Nochri's Chatzer and filled the house with wine, and Reuven has the key or a seal on it, the wine is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim forbid the wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Ze'iri):</span> The Halachah follows R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. <i>Elazar</i> (the Amora)):</span> One seal suffices for everything except for wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One seal suffices for everything, even for wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1A:</span> They do not argue (about what the Tana'im said). R. Elazar holds like Chachamim, and R. Yochanan holds like R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1B:</span> They do not argue (about the Halachah. All agree that the Halachah follows R. Eliezer.) R. Elazar explains Chachamim, and R. Yochanan explains R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Elazar):</span> Two seals suffice for everything except for wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Two seals suffice for everything, even for wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Both hold like Chachamim. R. Elazar explains that Chachamim argue even about two seals, and R. Yochanan explains that they only argue about one seal. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of two seals?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A bucket on top of the barrel is a double seal only if it is plastered on;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A basket over a corked barrel is a double seal only if it fits snugly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A wine pouch tied shut in a sealed sack is a double seal only if the opening of the pouch faces down (one must untie both in order to get the wine);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If one ties the pouch shut, presses the (tied opening) inside the pouch and ties again from the outside, this is a double seal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Originally, wine of Ein Kushi (and Barkesa... , cities of Kusim) was forbidden due to Biras Serika (and Kefar Parsha'i... , nearby cities of Nochrim). Later, Chachamim said that open barrels are forbidden, and closed barrels are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they originally forbid all wine, and why did they retract?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Originally, they thought that Kusim never guard wine from being touched by Nochrim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Later, they reasoned that they do not guard open barrels, but they guard sealed barrels (because they intend to sell to them to Yisraelim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even sealed barrels are forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sends a barrel of wine with a Kusi, or fish brine (with or without the innards mixed in), it is permitted only if he recognizes the seal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> A Kusi guards (his own wine) in the city. He does not guard (another's wine) on the road.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Also wine in the city was transported! (Why is it permitted?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> He guards when everyone is making wine, for then many people are around, and he fears lest people see a Nochri touch it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BEER OF NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is beer of Nochrim forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> This is a decree to distance from Nochrim, lest Yisrael come to intermarry with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> It is because they leave it exposed (perhaps there is venom inside).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> At what stage of the process of making beer are we concerned for exposure?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is while it is fermenting in the vat, also we leave it exposed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is while it is in the barrel, also we leave it exposed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is forbidden in a place where they leave the water (used for beer) exposed to become clear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, old beer should be permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If (wine or beer) was exposed, and it was aged, it is permitted. If it contained venom, it would not age properly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If grape juice was exposed, and it fermented, it is permitted. If it contained venom, it would not ferment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decree against old beer due to new beer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>They would take beer out of a Nochri's house, and Rav Papa would drink on the porch;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>They would bring beer from a Nochri's house to Rav Achai's house, he would drink in his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Both agree that it is forbidden (to drink in the Nochri's house) due to intermarriage. Rav Achai chose to distance himself further.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav Shmuel bar Bisna came to Margo'an (a city of Yisraelim in which they were not concerned if Nochrim touch wine). They brought to him wine, but he did not drink it. They brought to him beer, but he did not drink it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, he did not drink the wine, lest a Nochri touched it. Why did he not drink the beer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was a personal stringency, lest he drink their wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Beer of Nochrim is permitted. My son Chiya may not drink it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Either everyone is permitted, or everyone is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav holds that it is forbidden because they leave it exposed. The bitterness of the hops burns the venom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one is already sick, this will aggravate his condition. His son was sick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> All Sheratzim (rodents) have venom. Snake venom kills, but venom of other Sheratzim does not kill.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel citing Rav):</span> Nochrim do not die from drinking exposed liquids (even if snakes injected venom), because their bodies are hot from eating Shekatzim and Remasim (insects and swarming creatures), and this is Mevatel the venom.</p>
