<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SHAKING WITHOUT INTENT FOR 'NISUCH' (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi):</span> Rav Huna bar Chinena came to Mechuza (Rava's city). Rava told Rav Elyakim to keep him out, lest he overwhelm him with questions. Even so, he entered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna bar Chinena:</span> What is the law in this case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> One may not benefit from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> You said that shaking (without intent for Nisuch) does not make Yayin Nesech!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> (I agree that it makes Yayin Nesech.) I permitted selling the mixture only on condition to throw away the money corresponding to the Yayin Nesech. (This encounter was after Rava retracted due to Abaye's questions (coming up); he was ashamed to admit his mistake.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> Rav Nachman came to Mechuza. Rava went to see him. He told Rav Elyakim to keep <i>others</i> out, lest they distract them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> What is the law in this case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> One may not benefit from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> You said that shaking (without intent for Nisuch) does not make Yayin Nesech!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> I permitted selling the mixture only on condition to throw away the money corresponding to the Yayin Nesech. (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> When I came to Pumbadisa, Abaye refuted me from earlier Amora'im and a Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Abaye):</span> Cases occurred, and Shmuel (in Neharde'a) and R. Yochanan (in Tiverya) forbade benefit from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> That was not letter of the law. They were stringent because people of those cities were not learned. (Had they permitted it, the inhabitants would have incorrectly extrapolated to other cases.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> Do you think that people of Mechuza are more learned than those of Neharde'a and Tiverya?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which a Nochri appointed to supervise measures pierced a barrel, inserted a straw and sucked and raised the wine to his mouth, or tasted wine in a cup and returned it to the barrel. Chachamim forbade it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They forbade benefit from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> No, they forbade only drinking it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> If so, it should say 'it must be sold', like the Seifa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> A case occurred in which a crazed Nochri stuck his hand in what he thought is oil, but it was really wine. Chachamim ruled that it must be sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Rava is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A 'NOCHRI' WHO DID NOT INTEND FOR 'NISUCH'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Yochanan ben Arza and R. Yosi ben Nehorai were drinking wine together. A man came, and they offered him to drink. After he poured from the bottle into his cup, they realized that he was a Nochri. One of these two Chachamim permitted the bottle, and one forbade it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> Each of them has a good reason!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">58b----------------------------------------58b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The opinion that forbade reasoned that the Nochri assumed that distinguished Chachamim would not drink beer, so surely it is wine. Therefore, he was Menasech;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The opinion that permitted reasoned, the Nochri assumed that Chachamim would not invite a Nochri to drink wine, so surely it is beer. Therefore, he was not Menasech.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Nochri could see that it was wine!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He could smell that it was wine!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was new wine (which has no smell).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He touched the (Tosfos - wine when he used a) Keli to draw the wine from the barrel. Even without intention, this forbids the wine!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he merely emptied the wine out from a bottle (he merely gave it Ko'ach (impetus));</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim did not forbid a Nochri's Ko'ach when he did not intend to Menasech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Asi):</span> If a Nochri Masach (mixed) wine (with water), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Why didn't you say Mazag? (The Mishnayos use this word for 'mixed'.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Asi:</span> I use the word that the Torah uses - "Tovechah Tivchah Mosechah Yeinah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Chachamim use words unlike the Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It is forbidden, due to 'Lech Lech... ' (a Nazir should stay far from a vineyard. Likewise, everyone should distance himself from transgression.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>In Savta, R. Yirmeyah saw Yisraelim drinking wine mixed by Nochrim. He forbade this, like R. Yochanan.</p>
