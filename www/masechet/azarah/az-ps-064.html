<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DECREASING DESPISED MATTERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a worker was hired to break a barrel of Yayin Nesech, are the wages permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the Yisrael wants the wine to exist until he will (be paid to) dispose of it, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps we permit this, in order to decrease Tiflah (despised matters)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> He will be blessed for breaking it. (The wages are permitted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> We may not dig with a Nochri in a field in which he grows Kil'ayim, but we may uproot with him, to decrease Tiflah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We are thinking that the Beraisa is like R. Akiva, who says that one who is Mekayem (keeps) Kil'ayim (even if he did not plant it, but he builds a fence to guard it) is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who removes weeds from Kil'ayim or covers it with earth (to help it grow) is lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, even one who keeps it (is lashed).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Akiva's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Sadcha Lo Sizra Kil'ayim" forbids only seeding. What is the source to forbid Mekayem?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Lo Kil'ayim" forbids even keeping it. (Rashi alludes to the text in Makos and Mo'ed Katan "Kil'ayim Sadcha Lo." I.e. in the verse it says "Kil'ayim" also before "Sadcha Lo", and we read these words together to forbid having Kil'ayim in your field.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Culmination of support:</span> Even though R. Akiva forbids being Mekayem Kil'ayim, he permits taking wages to uproot it, to decrease Tiflah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Beraisa is Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Beraisa should permit being Mekayem, which is a bigger Chidush than uprooting it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the Yisrael helps for free. It is like R. Yehudah, who forbids giving a free gift to Nochrim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For the sake of decreasing Tiflah, he permits uprooting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Nachman):</span> R. Yehudah is lenient (to permit working for free for Nochrim) in order to decrease Tiflah. Surely, also R. Akiva is lenient (to permit uprooting Kil'ayim) in order to decrease Tiflah! (And likewise we are lenient about wages to break barrels of Yayin Nesech.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This cannot be challenged.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MONEY THAT A 'NOCHRI' RECEIVED FOR IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law of money that a Nochri received for (selling) idolatry?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does idolatry transfer its Isur (to what it is exchanged for) when a Nochri sells it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Presumably, it is permitted. We learn from the following episode:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some people who were about to convert came in front of Rabah bar Avuha. He counseled them to sell all their idolatry before converting.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This was because money a Nochri received for idolatry is permitted. (If they would sell it after converting, it would be forbidden.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since they planned to convert, surely they were Mevatel the idolatry before selling it. (but if not, it would transfer its Isur).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri owed money to a Yisrael and he sold idolatry or Yayin Nesech to get money to pay, the money is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'wait until I sell my idolatry or Yayin Nesech, then I will pay you', it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the clauses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> In the latter clause, the Yisrael is happy that the idolatry endures until it is sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even when a Yisrael wants idolatry to exist, this does not forbid money received for it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a convert and his Nochri brother inherited their father, the convert can say 'you take the idolatry and Yayin Nesech, and I will take the money and Peros';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If idolatry or Yayin Nesech already came to the convert's premises, he cannot ask for something in exchange for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar Ula):</span> The Mishnah refers to idolatry that retains its value even if broken (e.g. it is made of gold or silver. Therefore, the Yisrael does not care whether it is broken.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Yayin Nesech, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Yayin Nesech was absorbed in pottery shards. (Even if they are broken, the wine can be recovered.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even though the Yisrael doesn't care if it breaks, he wants the idolatry and Yayin Nesech around. If it would be lost or stolen, his brother would demand half of the money and Peros!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> (Mid'Oraisa, the convert does not inherit. Mid'Rabanan,) we are lenient, and allow him to inherit and 'trade' with his brother (before the idolatry comes to his premises), lest he resent losing his inheritance, renounce his conversion and revert to live like a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">64b----------------------------------------64b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> We allow this only regarding inheritance, but a Yisrael who was a partner with a Nochri may not request a larger share of permitted things in exchange for letting the Nochri keep the idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN A 'GER TOSHAV' BE 'MEVATEL' IDOLS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can a Ger Toshav be Mevatel idolatry?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps only one who serves idolatry can be Mevatel it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he is like a Nochri (he has only seven Mitzvos), he can be Mevatel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Presumably, since he does not serve idolatry, he cannot be Mevatel it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael found idolatry in the market, before he takes it, he can tell a Nochri to be Mevatel it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After he takes it, he cannot do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(The first law is because) Chachamim taught that a Nochri can be Mevatel his or his colleague's idolatry, whether or not he serves it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'whether or not he serves <i>it</i>'?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It means whether or not he serves <i>this</i> idolatry (but in any case, he serves idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The previous words already teach this, 'he can be Mevatel his or his colleague's idolatry'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It means whether or not he serves idolatry (and still, he can be Mevatel). Likewise, a Ger Toshav can be Mevatel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question (3)):</span> Really, it means whether or not he serves this idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The previous words teach that he can be Mevatel his own idol or his colleague's (who serves the same idolatry). This clause teaches that he can be Mevatel idols of a different idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A Ger Toshav is one who accepted in front of three Chaverim not to serve idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, he must accept the seven Mitzvos of Bnei Noach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Others say, he must accept all the Mitzvos, except for the Isur to eat Neveilos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Yisrael may leave a Ger Toshav alone with wine in the Yisrael's store for a short time, even if the city is mostly Nochrim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He may not deposit wine with him for a long time, even if the city is mostly Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The oil of a Ger Toshav is like his wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This implies that we are stringent to forbid benefit from his oil. This is unreasonable! (People are not Menasech oil. At most, it should be forbidden to eat, like we decreed about bread and cooked foods of Nochrim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> The wine of a Ger Toshav is like his oil. (One may not cosume it, but one may benefit from it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>In all other respects, he is like a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> R. Shimon says, his wine is Yayin Nesech.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> R. Shimon says, one may drink his wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'In all other respects, he is like a Nochri' teaches that he can be Mevatel idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, this teaches that he can give permission or be Mevatel his premises (i.e. allow others to enter his property, to enable an Eruv to permit carrying in a joint Chatzer).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael desecrates Shabbos in private, but not in public, he can be Mevatel his premises;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he desecrates Shabbos in public, he cannot be Mevatel his premises;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is because (he is like a Nochri, and) Chachamim said that a Yisrael can give permission or be Mevatel his premises. The only solution with a Nochri is if the Yisraelim rent his premises;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding a Yisrael, it suffices for him to say 'my premises are acquired or Batel to you.' This itself makes a Kinyan (regarding Eiruv).</p>
