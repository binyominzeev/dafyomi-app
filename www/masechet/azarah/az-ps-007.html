<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RULES FOR DECIDING THE HALACHAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehoshua ben Korchah and (in the Mishnah we shall cite) R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven asked Shimon to dye his wool red, and he died it black, or vice-versa, Shimon pays the value of the wool he received (and keeps it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, Reuven pays the increased value or Shimon's expenses, whichever is smaller.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Granted, you needed to say that the Halachah follows R. Yehoshua ben Korchah, for one would have thought that the Halachah follows the majority (Chachamim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, you did not need to teach that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah. When Tana'im argue in a Mishnah, and a subsequent Mishnah is Stam (unauthored), the Halachah follows the Stam!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue in the above Mishnah in Bava Kama, and a Stam Mishnah in Bava Metzia is like R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone who deviates has the lower hand. Anyone who retracts has the lower hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna holds that we cannot apply the above rule in this case, for we do not know which Mishnah came first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we can never apply the rule, for we do not now which Mishnah came first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We know the order within one Maseches.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yosef holds that Bava Kama, Bava Metzia and Bava Basra are all one Maseches (in that order).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Alternatively, Rav Yosef held that there was no need to teach that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah, because the Mishnah in Bava Metzia is like R. Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Since that Mishnah was taught (out of place) along with other laws, this teaches that it is the Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> Since the wording of that Mishnah is like stating decided Halachah, it is the Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OTHER PLACES WHERE THE HALACHAH FOLLOWS R. YEHOSHUA BEN KORCHAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Reuven may not say to Shimon (on Shabbos) 'come to me at night' (so I can hire you);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah permits this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehoshua ben Korchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven asked a Chacham (Moshe) a law, and Moshe ruled that the matter is Tamei or forbidden, Reuven may not ask another Chacham (Tosfos - unless he tells him how Moshe ruled);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If two Chachamim give different rulings, if one is greater than the other in Chachmah and number (of Talmidim), we follow his ruling. If not, we follow the stringent ruling;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah says, (if neither is greater), for a mid'Oraisa law, we follow the stringent ruling. For a mid'Rabanan law, we follow the lenient ruling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehoshua ben Korchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a robber or ignoramus seeks to repent (Tosfos - after he accepted to be trustworthy, and stumbled), we never (again) consider him to be reliable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> R. Yehudah says, if they are covert about repenting, we do not accept them. If they are open, we accept them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Another version says, if they sinned in private, we accept them. If they are sinned openly, we do not accept them (we suspect that their repentance is insincere).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> R. Yehudah says, if in private they did not fulfill what they previously accepted, we do not accept them (for they deceive people). If they openly stumbled, we accept them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Another version says, if they fulfilled their commitment in private, we accept them. If they fulfilled it (only) in public, we do not accept them. (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon and R. Yehoshua ben Korchah say 'in either case we accept them - "Shuvu Banim Shovevim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak of Ako):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon and R. Yehoshua ben Korchah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW MANY DAYS ARE FORBIDDEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> Three days before the festival are forbidden, and three days after it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, before the festival is forbidden. After the festival is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Tachlifa bar Avdimi):</span> According to R. Yishmael, one may never do business with Nochrim who celebrate Yom Rishon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> Before the festival is forbidden. After the festival is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is just like the first Tana of the Mishnah (2A)! (The Mishnah would not bring the same opinion twice, they must argue about something!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The first Tana forbids three days in addition to the festival. Chachamim forbid three days including the festival.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The first Tana permits b'Di'eved if one (bought from or) sold to them before the festival. Chachamim forbid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The first Tana agrees with Shmuel, who says that in Chutz la'Aretz, only the day of the festival is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim forbid the three previous days even in Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> The first Tana forbids three days before the festival. Chachamim forbid only one day before, like Nachum ha'Madi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Nachum ha'Madi):</span> Only one day before the festival is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No one ever said such a thing!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim (in our Mishnah) agree with him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Nachum is the Chachamim of our Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OTHER TEACHINGS OF NACHUM HA'MADI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Nachum ha'Madi):</span> We may sell an old male horse to Nochrim in wartime.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No one ever said such a thing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also Ben Beseira permits selling a horse to them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ben Beseira does not distinguish between male and female horses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since Nachum permits only male horses, he must hold like Chachamim (who argue with Ben Beseira). According to Chachamim, no one ever said such a thing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Nachum ha'Madi):</span> One must tithe the seeds, vegetable, and stems of dill.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No one ever said such a thing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar agrees with him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> One must tithe the seeds, vegetable, and stems of dill.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to dill that grows in a garden (all parts of it are edible. Nachum refers to dill that grows in a field. Normally, only the seeds are eaten.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Minyomi):</span> Can it be that no one agrees with anything that Nachum said?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We follow him regarding prayer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Nachum ha'Madi):</span> One may make personal requests in the middle of the blessing 'Shome'a Tefilah.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We do not rule like Nachum because he said the law, rather because Chachamim said so!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> One should request what he needs and then pray (Shemonah Esreh) - "Tefilah l'Ani Chi Ya'atof v'Lifnei Hash-m Yishpoch Sicho";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Sichah' means prayer - "va'Yetzei Yitzchak Lasu'ach ba'Sadeh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Yehoshua says, one should pray and then request what he needs - "Eshpoch Lefanav Sichi Tzarasi Lefanav Agid."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Eliezer explain this verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'I will pour my prayer in front of Him, when my needs are already before Him (I already asked).'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yehoshua explain "Chi Ya'atof v'Lifnei Hash-m Yishpoch Sicho"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'I will express my needs when my prayer is already before Hash-m (I already prayed).'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verses are inconclusive. What is the sourceof their argument?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about R. Simlai's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Simlai):</span> One should praise Hash-m before praying. We learn from Moshe - "Hash-m... Hachilosa Lehar'os Es Avdecha... Eberah Na v'Er'eh Es ha'Aretz."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yehoshua learns from Moshe;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Eliezer does not learn from Moshe. Moshe's awesome deeds and Chachmah made him proper to recount Hash-m's praises.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Chachamim say, one should request his needs (in the midst of prayer,) in 'Shome'a Tefilah.'</p>
