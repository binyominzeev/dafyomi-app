<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW MUCH IS FORBIDDEN WITH A 'NOCHRI'S' TOUCH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The spigot came off a barrel of wine. A Nochri ran and stuck his hand there to prevent the wine from spilling out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Papa):</span> The wine at the level of his hand (where the spigot was) is forbidden (Rashi - to drink; Tosfos - to benefit from it, but all the wine is forbidden to drink), the rest is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Papa):</span> The wine at or above the level of the spigot is forbidden (because the Nochri kept it from spilling out). The rest is permitted. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>(Rav Yemar) Rav Papa's law is like R. Yehudah, and unlike Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a barrel was punctured at the top, bottom or side, and a Tvul Yom (one who immersed today, he will be fully Tahor at nightfall) touched Terumah inside, all of it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, if it was punctured at the top or bottom, it is all Tamei (for it is all considered even with his hand);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the side was punctured, what the Tvul Yom touched is Tamei, and the rest is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If a Nochri poured wine from a bottle into a Keli held by a Yisrael, one may not benefit from the wine he poured;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Yisrael poured wine from a bottle into a Keli held by a Nochri, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the Nochri shook the Keli, it is forbidden (to benefit from the wine, lest he touched it. Alternatively, one may not drink the wine, for the Nochri's Ko'ach moved it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If a Nochri carried a sealed pouch of wine and a Yisrael saw that he did not reach inside:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the pouch is full, the wine is permitted (the wine cannot shake inside). If it is not full, the wine is forbidden, lest he shook it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he carried an open flask of wine (and a Yisrael supervised);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the flask is full, the wine is forbidden (perhaps the wine splashed onto his finger on top of the flask);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it is not full, the wine is permitted (we know that he did not touch it. He would not shake it, lest it spill.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> If he carried a sealed pouch, whether or not it is full, the wine is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not normal to be Menasech wine while carrying it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papi):</span> In a Ma'atzarta (a Gas in which grapes are not stomped, they are pressed solely by a beam), if a Nochri put the beam on them, the wine is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> The wine is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> All agree that if the Nochri's Ko'ach caused the pressing, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about Ko'ach of his Ko'ach (he gave impetus to something that caused the pressing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> All agree that Ko'ach of his Ko'ach does not forbid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about his Ko'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>A case occurred with Ko'ach of his Ko'ach, and R. Yakov of Nehar Pekod forbade it.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>A barrel full of wine cracked lengthwise (from top to bottom). A Nochri ran and held the barrel together so it would not split. Rafram bar Papa permitted selling the wine to Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had the barrel cracked widthwise (across the middle), it would be permitted to drink the wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Above, the barrel began splitting, the Nochri clamped the sides together, slightly shaking the wine). Here, the barrel would not have come apart (just wine would have seeped out). If a Nochri pressed down, he is merely like a weight on top.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>A Nochri was found in a Ma'atzarta (the wine had already been removed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> If the Gas is Tofe'ach Lehatfi'ach (wet enough to enable something that touches it to wet something else), it must be rinsed and dried;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Gas is only Tofe'ach (wet enough to wet something that touches it), it suffices to rinse it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN ARE WE CONCERNED FOR <i>NISUCH?</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri was found by Reuven's pit of wine:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven owes him money, the wine is forbidden (the Nochri feels free to be Menasech, for he can keep the wine to pay the debt).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven does not owe him money, the wine is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In the following cases, the wine may be sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Nochri fell into a pit of wine and came up;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Nochri inserted a rod to measure the wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Nochri chased a wasp from the wine with a rod;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A Nochri leveled off the foam on top of the wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Each of these cases actually occurred, and Chachamim permitted selling the wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Shimon says, it is permitted (to drink).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A case occurred in which a Nochri angrily threw a barrel into the pit. Chachamim permitted the wine in the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> The wine is forbidden only if it was collateral for Reuven's debt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven processed the wine of a Nochri (Tony) (to sell it to Yisraelim) and it was left in Tony's house, and Tony wrote 'I already received the money for it (from you)', the wine is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in Beis She'an. Tony did not let Reuven take it before paying, and Chachamim forbade the wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If Tony would let Reuven take it before paying, it would be permitted, even though Reuven owes him for it (since the wine is not collateral for the debt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Nochri fell into a pit of wine and came up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is only if he came up dead. If he came up alive, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> On the way up, he thanks his idolatry for saving him (and he is Menasech) like on his festival.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Nochri measured the wine with a rod... all of these cases occurred, and Chachamim said that the wine must be sold;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Shimon permits it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> R. Shimon is consistent. When he permits, he permits drinking the wine. When he forbids, he forbids all benefit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>The Halachah does not follow R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in which a Nochri angrily threw a barrel into the pit. Chachamim permitted it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> If a Zav would be Metamei a person through a certain action (e.g. he touched it directly or indirectly), if a Nochri did the same to wine, it becomes Yayin Nesech.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Zav would not Metamei through the action, if a Nochri did the same to wine, it is not Yayin Nesech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna - Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in which a Nochri angrily threw a barrel into a pit. Chachamim permitted the wine in the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he thrown it without anger, the wine would be forbidden (even though a Zav does not Metamei a person by throwing something at him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> He threw it into the pit from very close (but from far away, it is always permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer:</span> He was holding it the entire time, even when it hit the wine.</p>
