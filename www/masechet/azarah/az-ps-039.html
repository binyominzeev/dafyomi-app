<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FORBIDDEN FISH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Diced Tiryas (salted fish), brine in which there is not a fish (and Chilak... )</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Aba):</span> Chilak is Sultanis (sardine or herring). It is forbidden because there are Tamei fish that resemble it (and may be mixed in).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If it now lacks fins and scales but will grow them later, such as Sultanis or Afitz (in Chulin, the text is Afyan), it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it now has fins and scales but they fall off when it leaves the water, such as Akunas, Afunas (mullet), Kaspatias (salmon), Akaspatias (swordfish?) and Atunas (tuna), it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Fish innards and fish eggs may be bought from anyone. Normally, they come only from Plusa and Aspamya (and Tamei fish are not common there).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Chilak of the Davav River is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The water flows rapidly. Tamei fish cannot survive there because they lack a spine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We see that Tamei fish live (in rapidly flowing water)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, because it is very salty, Tamei fish cannot survive there because they lack scales.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We see that Tamei fish live (in very salty water)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The nature of the Davav river floor does not allow Tamei fish to live there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Nowadays, the Guza and Gamda rivers flow into the Davav river. We are concerned for Tamei fish from those rivers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The sea-donkey (the fish that corresponds to a donkey) is permitted. The sea-ox is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Siman (way to remember this) is 'Tahor Tamei (what is Tahor on land is Tamei in water), Tamei Tahor.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1A - our text, Rashi (Rav Ashi):</span> Shaper-fish is permitted. Kadesh-fish is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Siman is "Kodesh la'Shem" (Kodesh is forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #1B:</span> Kever-fish is forbidden. A Siman is 'Kivrei (graves of) Nochrim' (they are Tamei. Even though graves of Yisrael are as or even more Tamei, perhaps we did not want a Siman that alludes to death of Yisre'elim -<b>PF</b>.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #2A - R. Chananel (Rav Ashi):</span> Shaper-fish is forbidden. Kadesh-fish is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Siman is "Kodesh Yisrael la'Shem" (Kodesh is proper for Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2B:</span> Kever-fish is permitted. A Siman is 'Kivrei (graves of) Nochrim' (they do not have Tum'as Ohel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>R. Akiva came to Ginzak. They put in front of him a fish resembling Chipusa (which is Tamei). He covered it with a barrel, and later found scales on the barrel. He permitted it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Rav Ashi came to Tamdoriya. They put in front of him a fish resembling an eel (which is Tamei). He put it in the sun, and found fine scales on it. He permitted it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Rav Ashi came to a place. They put in front of him a fish resembling Shaper-fish. He covered it with a white Keli, and later found scales on the Keli. He permitted it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>Rabah bar bar Chanah came to Akra d'Agma. They put Chilak in front of him. He heard someone calling it 'Bati' (a Tamei fish). He decided not to eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the morning, he indeed found Tamei fish inside, and thanked Hash-m for saving him from transgression.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO IS TRUSTWORTHY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A piece of Chiltis (of Nochrim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They cut it with knives that absorbed forbidden taste.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though (we assume that a Keli was not used for (forbidden) food in the last day, and absorbed tastes over a day old are normally li'Fgam, and) Nosen Ta'am li'Fgam is permitted, because Chiltis is (so) sharp, it causes the absorbed fat (in the knife) to improve the taste.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Levi's slave used to sell Chiltis, After R. Levi died, people asked R. Yochanan if they may still buy from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The slave of a Chaver (one who is totally reliable) is like a Chaver.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Huna bar Minyomi bought Techeiles from the wife of Rav Amram Chasida.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Chanan Chaita:</span> A case occurred in which Shmuel ruled that the wife of a Chaver is like a Chaver.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The wife of a Chaver is like a Chaver. The slave of a Chaver is like a Chaver;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Chaver dies, his wife and household are still considered Chaverim, until there are grounds to suspect them. This applies also in a courtyard where they sell Techeiles</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the widow, divorcee or daughter of an ignoramus marries a Chaver, or if the slave of an ignoramus is sold to a Chaver, she (or he) must accept to conduct like a Chaver;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says, If the widow, divorcee, daughter or slave of a Chaver marries or is sold to an ignoramus, l'Chatchilah, she need not accept to conduct like a Chaver;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah and R. Shimon ben Elazar say, l'Chatchilah, she must accept to conduct like a Chaver;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A case occurred in which a woman married a Chaver, and helped tie Tefilin on his arm. She later married a tax collector (he is assumed to steal), and helped tie the seals (receipts given to those who paid) on his arm.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW WELL THINGS MUST BE GUARDED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A double seal is needed for the following: milk, meat, wine and Techeiles (lest he switch them with similar forbidden food (or invalid Techeiles) or pour the wine to idolatry. Meforshim differ about whether we discuss a deposit with a Nochri (Rambam), or with a Nochri or suspected Yisrael (Rashba), or only with a suspected Yisrael (R. Tam); or sending them with a Nochri (Tosfos 31a),</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Siman is the initial letters (in Hebrew). They spell CHaVIS (barrel).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">One seal suffices for the following:</span> Chiltis, fish innards, bread and cheese;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The initials of these spell CHaMPaG.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Tosfos) (Implied question:</span> Why does one seal suffice for bread?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> What concern is there for bread?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he would take your warm bread and replace it with (his forbidden) cold bread, it would be evident that he switched!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he will take your wheat bread and replace it with barley bread, it would be evident that he switched!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The only concern is lest he switch bread of the same type and freshness (because yours is slightly better). He would not bother trying to forge even one seal for this. (end of Version #1)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav says that one seal suffices for cheese. He would not bother trying to forge the seal to switch with his own;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Likewise, one seal should suffice also for milk!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Kahana):</span> Indeed, it does. Rather, the 'Ches' of 'Chavis' stands for Chatichah (a piece of fish without signs that it is Kosher).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is just like meat, which was already taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, both were taught even though they are very similar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A double seal is needed for meat, wine and Techeiles. The acronym is BaYiS;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One seal suffices for Chiltis, fish innards, and cheese. The acronym is MaCHaG.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> Shmuel need not teach about bread. Surely one seal is necessary and sufficient!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He would not take warm (or wheat) bread and replace it with cold (or barley) bread. It would be evident that he switched!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The only concern is that he will switch bread of the same type and freshness. He would not bother forging a seal for this. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following may only be bought from reliable (Yisraelim) in Surya (Rambam - and all the more so, in Chutz la'Aretz proper): wine, fish innards, milk, Salkundris salt, Chiltis, and cheese. The acronym is YeMaCH MeCHaG.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A guest may rely on his host regarding all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This supports R. Yehoshua ben Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If a regular person sent (one of these) for a gift, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not suspect a person of eating forbidden food (only selling it). Presumably, the giver gave from what he eats himself.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SALKUNDRIS SALT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Salkundris salt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is salt eaten by bakers (Rashi; Ran - important people) of Romi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Black Salkundris salt is forbidden. White is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, white Salkundris salt is forbidden. Black is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah ben Gamliel says, both are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> R. Yehudah forbids white Salkundris salt because they mix in innards of white fish. R. Meir forbids black salt because they mix in innards of black fish. R. Yehudah ben Gamliel forbids both due to white and black fish innards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu citing R. Yehudah ben Gamliel):</span> There was a Nochri who used to smooth out the salt with lard of pigs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> These are forbidden (to eat; one may benefit from them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> According to Chizkiyah, it excludes when we know that wine was mixed in (with preserved foods, for then one may not benefit from them). According to R. Yochanan, it excludes fish innards and cheese of Beis Onaiki. The Mishnah is like R. Meir (who forbids benefit from them).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>PERMITTED FOODS OF NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following may be eaten:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Milk milked by a Nochri when a Yisrael was watching, honey, Dovdevaniyos (Rashi - clusters of grapes; Rambam - cakes of honey taken from hives);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though the Dovdevaniyos are dripping, it is not considered a liquid for Hechsher (to make foods susceptible to receive Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(Also these may be eaten-) preserved foods in which wine or vinegar is not normally mixed in; Tiryas that is not diced; fish brine in which there is a fish; a leaf of Chiltis; and clumps of soft olives;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, Shelachin are forbidden (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Grasshoppers from the basket are forbidden. Those from the storehouse are permitted. The same applies regarding Terumah (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Our Mishnah teaches like the following Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Yisrael may sit outside the herd of a Nochri milking his animals and buy the milk. He need not be concerned (lest milk of Tamei animals was mixed in).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If there are no Tamei animals in the herd, obviously we are not concerned!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If there are Tamei animals in the herd, we should be concerned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are Tamei animals in the herd. When the Yisrael stands, he can see the Nochri, when he sits, he cannot see him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One might have thought that since he cannot see the Nochri when he sits, we should be concerned lest milk of Tamei animals was mixed in. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so, because the Nochri fears lest the Yisrael stand and see him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Honey.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>It is permitted, for there is nothing to be concerned about!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are not concerned lest the Nochri mixed in wine, for this would make it spoil!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We are not concerned for Bishul Akum, for honey is normally eaten raw!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We are not concerned lest it absorbed tastes from his Kelim. Any absorbed tastes would be detrimental to honey, so they do not forbid it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A cluster of grapes is not considered a liquid for Hechsher, even if juice drips from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa -Shamai):</span> If one harvests grapes in order to make wine, the juice that drips from them is Machshir them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hillel says, it is not Machshir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hillel later agreed to Shamai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, he wants the juice to exude from the grapes, therefore it is Machshir. Here (he wants to eat the grapes,) he does not want the juice to come out.</p>
