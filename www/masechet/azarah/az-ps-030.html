<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>COOKED AND MIXED WINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Cooked wine and Aluntis (a drink in which wine is mixed) of Nochrim is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We permit Aluntis of a Nochri in its original state (Rashi - he bought it from a Yisrael, for the wine was mixed before the Nochri got it; Tosfos - he buys the other ingredients. We are not concerned lest the Nochri added wine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Aluntis?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> We may make Anomalin on Shabbos, and not Aluntis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anomalin is wine, honey and peppers; Aluntis is old wine, clear water and balsam oil. It is a cure to help one cool off after a hot bath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> We are not concerned if mixed wine was exposed (lest a snake drank from it and emitted poison in it). We are not concerned lest a Nochri be Menasech cooked wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are we concerned if cooked wine was exposed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yakov bar Idi):</span> We are not concerned if cooked wine was exposed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael ben Zirud:</span> (Also) R. Chiya said that we are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> May we rely on this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Shmuel was sitting with Avlet (a Nochri). Cooked wine was put in front of them. Avlet was careful not to touch it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> We are not concerned for Nisuch of cooked wine. You may touch it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Cooked wine of R. Chiya's slave was exposed. He told her that we are not concerned for exposure of cooked wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Mixed wine of Rav Ada bar Ahavah's servant was exposed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada):</span> We are not concerned for exposure of mixed wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is only if it is well diluted. If it is not so diluted, we are concerned for exposure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do snakes really drink partially diluted wine?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah bar Rav Huna was on a boat; he had wine with him. A snake was approaching. Rabah's servant added a little water to the wine, and the snake turned away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Snakes will risk their lives (and drink in front of people) for unmixed wine, but not for mixed wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that snakes do not risk their lives from mixed wine?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yanai was drinking mixed wine. Some was left, and he covered it with a garment. He saw a snake add water until the level of the wine went above the garment, and drink it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A snake will risk its life for wine that it mixed itself, but not for wine that others mixed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> We cannot rely on (poor) answers to be lenient about a (mortal) danger! (Rather, we are always concerned for exposure of mixed wine.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is, we are concerned for exposure and Nisuch of mixed wine. We are not concerned for exposure and Nisuch of cooked wine.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EXPOSED WATER AND FOODS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Water of R. Chilkiyah bar Tuvi's servant was exposed. He was sleeping right by it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chilkiyah:</span> Snakes are afraid of people who are sleeping.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is only during the day. At night, they are not afraid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is wrong. Snakes are not afraid of sleeping people, not during the day or at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rav would not drink water in a Nochri's house, for they are not careful enough about exposure. He would drink in a (Yisraelis) widow's house. (Even if she does not know the Halachos,) she conducts like she did in her husband's lifetime. (Me'iri - Rav (and Shmuel below) do not forbid others to do so. They themselves were stringent.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Shmuel would not drink water in a (Yisraelis) widow's house. She has no fear of a husband, she is not careful enough about exposure;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He would drink water in a Nochri's house. Even though they are not concerned enough for snakes, they cover water for cleanliness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Shmuel would not drink water in a widow's house, nor in a Nochri's house. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> For three kinds of wine there is no concern about exposure: sharp, bitter and sweet:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> We are not concerned for sharp wine that is strong enough to break a pouch, for bitter wine that is bad, or for wine that is sweet because the sun ruined the grapes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Chama):</span> The three wines we are not concerned for are good wines! The cases are, it is sharp due to peppers and spices, it is bitter from wormwood, or it is a sweet, good drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> We are not concerned for exposure of Karina.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Karina is sweet vinegar of Asya.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> In Asya, we are concerned for exposure of Karina.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the primary drink there, so snakes are used to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If wine started souring, for three days we are concerned for exposure and Nisuch. After three days, we are not concerned for either.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Neharde'a):</span> Even after three days we are concerned for exposure. Sometimes, a snake will drink it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We are not concerned for exposure of Toses wine (that did not yet ferment, i.e. grape juice).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long is it considered Toses?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is for three days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>We are not concerned for exposure of cress. In Bavel, they are concerned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if it has no vinegar. If it does, this deters snakes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>We are not concerned for exposure of Kutach (a dip made with moldy bread and whey). In Bavel, they are concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Menashi):</span> If we see holes in it (which might be from snakes), we are concerned (even in Eretz Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> We are not concerned for exposure of dripping wine (this deters snakes);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> This is only if it drips constantly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If one detached a fig from a tree and part remained on the tree (and he does not see a bite marks in the part he detached), we are not concerned lest a snake bit it on the part left on the tree and poisoned the fig.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>This is like the following Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> One may eat figs and dates at night (even though he cannot check them for bite marks), without concern - "Shomer Pesa'im Hash-m" (Hash-m guards fools who do not know to guard themselves).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FOODS THAT WERE EXPOSED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Safra):</span> There are three types of venom. Venom of a young snake sinks (to the bottom), that of a middle-age snake goes to the middle, and that of an old snake stays on top.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Older snakes are weaker (their venom is less dense).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Three things get stronger with age: fish, snakes and pigs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They get stronger, but the venom gets weaker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he need to teach that venom of a young snake sinks?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a barrel was exposed, even if nine people drank from it (and are fine), one may not drink from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in which a tenth person drank, and he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> This is because the venom was at the bottom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Similarly, if a cut watermelon was exposed, even if nine people ate from it, one may not eat from it. A case occurred in which a tenth person ate, and he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One one may not pour exposed water in a Reshus ha'Rabim, nor sprinkle it in the house (to keep the dust from rising), nor use it to knead mud, nor give to his or another's animal to drink, nor wash his hands, feet and face;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Others say, he may wash only places where there are no cracks. (Drops remain in cracks, and the venom would burn through his skin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about the back of the hand or foot, and cheekbones (there are no cracks, but the first Tana forbids them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> He may not give it to his or another's animal to drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> He may give it his own animal to drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #2 permits giving it to his cat. (Rashi - the venom will not harm it; Ran - we are concerned only for a Kosher animal, lest one eat it and be harmed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should be allowed to give it also to another's cat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This may weaken the cat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It may weaken also his own cat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It will return to health.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also another's cat will return to health!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the owner needs to sell it now, and no one will buy it.</p>
