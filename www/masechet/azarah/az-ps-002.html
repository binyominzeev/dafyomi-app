<p class="dedicationbox">AVODAH ZARAH 2 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DEALINGS WITH OVDEI KOCHAVIM BEFORE THEIR FESTIVALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are forbidden three days before Eidehen (festivals) of idolators: to buy from or sell to them (Rashi; R. Tam - to sell to them things that are offered to idolatry), to lend to them or borrow from them objects or money, and to pay up or collect loans;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah permits collecting loans from them, for this pains them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Even though it pains them now, it gladdens them later.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav or Shmuel):</span> The word Eideihen (festivals) in the Mishnah is spelled with an Aleph;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> It is spelled with an Ayin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Both texts are reasonable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Eideihen with an Aleph is reasonable, like it says "Karov Yom Eidam" (the day of their downfall);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Edeihen with an Ayin is reasonable, like it says "Yitenu Edeihem v'Yitzdaku" (they will bring witnesses and be justified).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the first opinion favor Eideihen?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That expression is used to refer to their downfall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the second opinion favor Edeihen?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Their downfall is due to the Edus (testimony) that they will give against themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> "Yitenu Edeihem v'Yitzdaku" refers to Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):"Yitenu Edeihem v'Yitzdaku" - Mitzvos that Yisrael do in this world testify for them in the world to come;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Va'Yomeru Emes" refers to the idolators.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Rather, Edeihen is reasonable, like it says "Yotzerei Fesel... v'Edeihen Hemah."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE FINAL JUDGMENT OF THE NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> In the future, Hash-m will hold a Sefer Torah and offer reward to all who engaged in Torah. All the Nochrim will come together. Hash-m will insist that one nation come at a time.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Hash-m can judge them all together!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He wants each nation to hear what He says to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Romi will be the first to be judged, for it is most important;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "V'Seichul Kol Ara u'Sdushinah v'Sadekinah" is Romi, whose fame (Rashi; Maharsha - coinage) spans the entire world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the most important is first to be judged?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Rav Chisda taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The king enters for judgment before the nation - "La'asos Mishpat Avdo u'Mishpat Amo Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is improper for the king to wait outside until the nation is judged.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If the nation were judged first, perhaps Hash-m would be angry when He judges the king (and punish him for their sins).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> How did you engage in Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Romi:</span> We established markets, built bathhouses, and made money plentiful, all in order that Yisrael can engage in Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> Fools! (True, I helped you to do all that in order that Yisrael can engage in Torah, but) you intended for your own benefit (therefore, you get no reward for this);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You established markets for your own benefit, (even) to house harlots;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>You built bathhouses to indulge yourselves;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The money is mine - "Li ha'Kesef v'Li ha'Zahav Ne'um Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Can you say that you engaged in this (the Torah given through Moshe)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Romi left dejected. Peras entered next, for they are second in importance.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "Sinyanah Damyah l'Dov (the second creature in Nebuchadnetzar's dream was like a bear)" - this represents Peras. They are like bears in the following ways: their eating and drinking habits, their obesity, they are hairy, and they are always moving.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> How did you engage in Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Peras:</span> We built bridges, conquered great cities, and made many wars, all in order that Yisrael can engage in Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> You intended for your own benefit!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You built bridges in order to collect taxes, you conquered cities to conscript people to serve the king;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>I made the wars - "Hash-m Ish Milchamah"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Can you say that you engaged in Torah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Peras left dejected.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since they saw Hash-m's answer to Romi, why did they hope to get reward?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They thought that Romi gets no reward for they destroyed the (second) Mikdash, but Peras will be rewarded, for they helped built it (in the days of Koresh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Similarly, every nation enters hopeful of reward, but is dejected by Hash-m's rebuttal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> After they saw Hash-m's answers to the previous nations, why did they hope to get reward?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Each thinks that it did not subjugate Yisrael like the others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Chanina mention only Romi and Peras?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The kingdoms of Romi and Peras will endure until Mashiach.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE NOCHRIM GET ANOTHER CHANCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">The Nochrim:</span> Will You say that You offered us the Torah and we refused it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Indeed, He did!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Hash-m mi'Sinai Ba v'Zarach mi'Se'ir Lamo"; and it says "Eloka mi'Teiman Yavo (v'Kadosh me'Har Paran)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was Hash-m in Se'ir (Esav's inheritance) and Paran (where Yishmaelim live)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> This teaches that Hash-m offered the Torah to every nation, but only Yisrael accepted it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the Nochrim will ask 'did we accept the Torah and did not fulfill it?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is self-incriminating (for refusing the Torah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they will say 'did You hold a mountain over us (like You did for Yisrael) and we refused it?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi bar Chama):</span> "Va'Yitzyatzvu b'Sachtis ha'Har" - Hash-m suspended the mountain over Yisrael like a barrel, and said 'if you do not accept the Torah, you will be buried there.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> Because you did not observe the seven Mitzvos you already had, I did not force you to accept the rest.</p>
